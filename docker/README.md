# ASReview with Docker

## Quickstart using Docker
If you have docker installed, you can run ASReview with Docker.

For a quickstart of ASReview LAB, the latest version of the ASReview LAB can be started as via
Docker like this:

 ```
 docker run -p 5000:5000 asreview/asreview
 ```

This will start the ASReview LAB server on port 5000 with default command line
options and make it accessible to the host at http://localhost:5000

A special command line interface image is available as `asreview/asreview-cli`.
Make sure to use the -ti flag to start the image in interactive mode.


## Advanced usage

Docker is a very powerful tool for running software in a container, and many
different options are available to customize the behavior of the container.

To create a container for ASReview LAB and name the container, you can use the
following command:

```
docker create --name asreview-lab -p 5000:5000 asreview/asreview
```

To run this container, use the following command:

```
docker start asreview-lab
```

To use a specific image of ASReview LAB, in this case `asreview:0.19`, you can
use the following command. For a list of available versions, visit the
[DockerHub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/asreview/asreview/tags/).

```
docker create --name asreview-lab -p 5000:5000 asreview/asreview:0.19
```

To run multiple containers of asreview LAB at the same time, a new port has to be
specified for each container. Adjust the host port to the port you want to use.
```
docker create --name asreview-0.19 -p 5019:5000 asreview/asreview:0.19
docker create --name asreview-0.17.1 -p 5017:5000 asreview/asreview:release-0.17.1
```

Advanced command line options can be given after the image, like this:
```
docker create --name asreview-lab -p 5000:5000 asreview/asreview --seed 12345
```

### Connect to the local project folder

To attach the container to your local project folder (or any other local
folder), the -v flag can be used in the following way. Adjust
`path-to-your-folder` to your local folder. When a project folder is specified,
ASReview LAB will store and load all its projects from this folder.
Note that multiple containers can access the same folder, making switching
between versions even easier than before.

```
docker create --name asreview-lab -p 5000:5000 -v path-to-your-folder:/project_folder asreview/asreview
```

### Build your own image

If you want to use a specific version of ASReview LAB, not available as
DockerHub image, you can build your own. To build your own image, create a file
called `Dockerfile` (no file extension) and fill it with the following code.
In this example, ASReview version `1.0rc0` was used.

```
FROM python:3.8
RUN pip install asreview==1.0rc0
ENTRYPOINT ["asreview","lab","--ip","0.0.0.0"]
ENV ASREVIEW_PATH=project_folder
```
To build an image from this file, use the following command from the same
directory as the dockerfile is in:

```
docker build -t asreview:1.0rc0 .
```

After the image was build, it can be used for a container just like the
DockerHub images.
```
docker create --name asreview-lab -p 5000:5000 asreview:1.0rc0
```
