{"title":"Radioablation +\/\u2212 hormonotherapy for prostate cancer oligorecurrences (Radiosa trial): potential of imaging and biology (AIRC IG-22159)","abstract":"Abstract Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer among men. New imaging-modalities have increased the diagnosed patients with limited number of metastasis after primary curative therapy, introducing so-called oligometastatic state. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is emerging as a low-toxicity treatment to erase PCa localizations and postpone androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). A deeper understanding of the predictive role of biomarkers is desirable for a targeted treatment selection and surveillance programs. The aims of the RADIOSA trial are: Compare SBRT +\/\u2212 ADT for oligorecurrent-castration-sensitive PCa (OCS-PCa) in terms of efficacy, toxicity and Quality of Life (QoL). Develop biology\/imaging based prognostic tool that allows identifying OCS-PCa subclasses. Methods This is a randomized phase II clinical trial, recruiting 160 OCS-PCa in 3 years, with progression-free survival (PFS) as primary endpoint. Three tasks will be developed: Randomized clinical study (3 years for accrual and 2 years for follow-up and data analysis); Imaging study, including imaging registration and METastasis Reporting and Data System (MET-RADS) criteria; Pre-clinical study, development of a biobank of blood samples for the analysis of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and preparatory for a subsequent miRNA profiling. We aim to determine which arm is justified for testing in a subsequent Phase III trial. A decision-tree algorithm, based on prognosis, biological phenotype and imaging profile, will be developed. Discussion Recruiting will start in July 2019. SBRT will allow obtaining excellent PFS, local control, QoL and low toxicity. In SBRT arm, ADT deferral will allow for a drug-holiday, delaying the detrimental impact on QoL. A sufficient number of blood samples will be collected to perform biological patient profiling. A stratification tool will be established with an analysis of morphological and functional imaging, based on the use of MET-RADS criteria. So, in conclusion, RADIOSA aims to define the optimal management of bone\/nodal PCa relapses in a SBRT regimen. This study will increase our knowledge on low-burden metastatic PCa in the era of high precision and high technology personalized medicine, offering highly effective therapy in terms of clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness. Trial registration The RADIOSA study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT03940235 , May 2019).","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/bmccancer.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12885-019-6117-z"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The first step in ensuring patient-centred quality of care: ask the patient","abstract":"Health providers may not be aware of their patients' needs or preferences, and patients reluctant to raise their concerns. Consequently, the first step in ensuring quality of care is to ask the patient about the care that they would like. A cross-sectional sample of 244 medical oncology outpatients were surveyed about provider-asking behaviours across six dimensions of patient-centred care defined by the Institute of Medicine. Specifically, were patients asked by clinic staff at the treatment centre about their physical and emotional symptoms, information needs to enable decision-making, preferences for involvement in decision-making, involvement of family and friends, and appointment scheduling. Patients were significantly (Cochran's \u03c72 (9) = 122.541, P < 0.001) less likely to be asked about emotional symptoms (35% infrequently asked), preferences for the involvement of family and friends (25% infrequently asked), and preferences for involvement in medical decision-making (23% infrequently asked). Only a minority of patients were infrequently asked about their treatment-related information needs (8%), physical symptoms (13% pain, 14% fatigue) and preferences for appointment scheduling (13%). Younger age, not Australian born and greater educational qualifications were associated with being infrequently asked. Improvements to care delivery can be made if clinic staff were to more regularly elicit patient's emotional symptoms, and their preferences for the involvement of family\/friends and participation in medical decision-making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/ecc.12435"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Anaesthetic perioperative management of patients with pancreatic cancer","abstract":"Pancreatic cancer remains a significant and unresolved therapeutic challenge. Currently, the only curative treatment for pancreatic cancer is surgical resection. Pancreatic surgery represents a technically demanding major abdominal procedure that can occasionally lead to a number of pathophysiological alterations resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Systemic, rather than surgical complications, cause the majority of deaths. Because patients are increasingly referred to surgery with at advanced ages and because pancreatic surgery is extremely complex, anaesthesiologists and surgeons play a crucial role in preoperative evaluations and diagnoses for surgical intervention. The anaesthetist plays a key role in perioperative management and can significantly influence patient outcome. To optimise overall care, patients should be appropriately referred to tertiary centres, where multidisciplinary teams (surgical, medical, radiation oncologists, gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists and anaesthetists) work together and where close cooperation between surgeons and anaesthesiologists promotes the safe performance of major gastrointestinal surgeries with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. In this review, we sought to provide simple daily recommendations to the clinicians who manage pancreatic surgery patients to make their work easier and suggest a joint approach between surgeons and anaesthesiologists in daily decision making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3748\/wjg.v20.i9.2304"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Implementation of Novel Molecular Biomarkers for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in the Netherlands: How to Deal With Increasing Complexity","abstract":"The diagnostic landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is changing rapidly with the availability of novel treatments. Despite high-level healthcare in the Netherlands, not all patients with NSCLC are tested with the currently relevant predictive tumor markers that are necessary for optimal decision-making for today's available targeted or immunotherapy. An expert workshop on the molecular diagnosis of NSCLC involving pulmonary oncologists, clinical chemists, pathologists, and clinical scientists in molecular pathology was held in the Netherlands on December 10, 2018. The aims of the workshop were to facilitate cross-disciplinary discussions regarding standards of practice, and address recent developments and associated challenges that impact future practice. This paper presents a summary of the discussions and consensus opinions of the workshop participants on the initial challenges of harmonization of the detection and clinical use of predictive markers of NSCLC. A key theme identified was the need for broader and active participation of all stakeholders involved in molecular diagnostic services for NSCLC, including healthcare professionals across all disciplines, the hospitals and clinics involved in service delivery, healthcare insurers, and industry groups involved in diagnostic and treatment innovations. Such collaboration is essential to integrate different technologies into molecular diagnostics practice, to increase nationwide patient access to novel technologies, and to ensure consensus-preferred biomarkers are tested.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fonc.2019.01521\/pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Implementing Decision Coaching for Lung Cancer Screening in the Low-Dose Computed Tomography Setting","abstract":"PURPOSE: The uptake of shared decision making (SDM) for lung cancer screening (LCS) as required by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is suboptimal. Alternative models for delivering SDM are needed, such as decision coaching in the low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) setting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Replicating Effective Programs framework guided our implementation of decision coaching, which included a patient-facilitated component before screening followed by in-person coaching that addressed the required elements for the SDM visit from CMS. We surveyed two LCS patient cohorts (pre-implementation and implementation of decision coaching) about their knowledge of LCS and perception of the SDM process. We conducted time-motion studies to assess the feasibility of implementing decision coaching and audio recorded clinical encounters from the implementation cohort to assess fidelity of the SDM conversation to the CMS requirements. RESULTS: Compared with the pre-implementation cohort (n = 51), the implementation cohort (n = 30) had greater knowledge of LCS ( P &lt; .01) and reported a better SDM process ( P = .01). Coaching took 7.6 \u00b1 4.1 minutes and did not increase visit time ( P = .72). Coaches addressed an average of 6.4 of 7 SDM elements required by CMS. CONCLUSION: Decision coaching in the LDCT setting provides an opportunity for patients to confirm their screening decision by ensuring that patients are truly informed about the potential harms and benefits of LCS. The decision coaching had excellent fidelity in addressing the required SDM elements from CMS and is feasible.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/ascopubs.org\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1200\/JOP.19.00453"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Barriers and Facilitators to Fertility-Related Discussions with Teenagers and Young Adults with Cancer: Nurses' Experiences","abstract":"Introduction: Improvements in cancer survival rates for teenagers and young adults (TYAs) have resulted in quality-of-life issues into survivorship becoming increasingly important. However, infertility is a potential late side effect of cancer treatment, which can negatively impact on quality of life. Advances in assisted reproductive technologies have resulted in increasingly effective fertility preservation (FP) options. Purpose: This study aimed to explore nurses' experiences of undertaking fertility-related discussions with TYAs with cancer aged 13-24 years. Methods: An interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach was used. Eleven purposively selected nurses working on a specialist TYA cancer unit participated in semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using IPA. Results: Parents\/family were experienced as self-appointed informal gatekeepers who were perceived to hold the power to control nurses' access to communicate with young people about fertility issues. Nurses adopted a supportive role, which was enhanced by the positive nature of their relationship with the TYA. Uncertainty was expressed over whether the TYA had been fully informed of their infertility risk and potential FP options. Conclusions: Nurses should manage parental involvement sensitively if TYAs are to make informed decisions regarding their future reproductive health. There is a need for clear role delineation in fertility discussions to ensure that TYAs are provided with the opportunity to discuss infertility risk and be referred to a specialist before initiating cancer treatment. Nurses should cultivate the primacy of the nurse-TYA relationship to improve fertility care. Further research into the factors that TYAs may consider beneficial within the nurse-patient relationship is required.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/dora.dmu.ac.uk\/handle\/2086\/19072"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Role of norms in variation in cancer centers\u2019 end-of-life quality: qualitative case study protocol","abstract":"Abstract Background A critical barrier to improving the quality of end-of-life (EOL) cancer care is our lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying variation in EOL treatment intensity. This study aims to fill this gap by identifying 1) organizational and provider practice norms at major US cancer centers, and 2) how these norms influence provider decision making heuristics and patient expectations for EOL care, particularly for minority patients with advanced cancer. Methods This is a multi-center, qualitative case study at six National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) Comprehensive Cancer Centers. We will theoretically sample centers based upon National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsed EOL quality metrics and demographics to ensure heterogeneity in EOL intensity and region. A multidisciplinary team of clinician and non-clinician researchers will conduct direct observations, semi-structured interviews, and artifact collection. Participants will include: 1) cancer center and clinical service line administrators; 2) providers from medical, surgical, and radiation oncology; palliative or supportive care; intensive care; hospital medicine; and emergency medicine who see patients with cancer and have high clinical practice volume or high local influence (provider interviews and observations); and 3) adult patients with metastatic solid tumors and whom the provider would not be surprised if they died in the next 12 months and their caregivers (patient and caregiver interviews). Leadership interviews will probe about EOL institutional norms and organization. We will observe inpatient and outpatient care for two weeks. Provider interviews will use vignettes to probe explicit and implicit motivations for treatment choices. Semi-structured interviews with patients near EOL, or their family members and caregivers will explore past, current, and future decisions related to their cancer care. We will import transcribed field notes and interviews into Dedoose software for qualitative data management and analysis, and we will develop and apply a deductive and inductive codebook to the data. Discussion This study aims to improve our understanding of organizational and provider practice norms pertinent to EOL care in U.S. cancer centers. This research will ultimately be used to inform a provider-oriented intervention to improve EOL care for racial and ethnic minority patients with advanced cancer.

{"title":"Clinicians\u2019 attitudes and perceived barriers and facilitators to cancer treatment clinical practice guideline adherence: a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative literature","abstract":"Abstract Background Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) synthesize the best available evidence to guide clinician and patient decision making. There are a multitude of barriers and facilitators to clinicians adhering to CPGs; however, little is known about active cancer treatment CPG adherence specifically. This systematic review sought to identify clinician attitudes, and perceived barriers and facilitators to active cancer treatment CPG adherence. Methods A systematic search was undertaken of five databases; Ovid Medline, PsychInfo, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and PROQUEST. The retrieved abstracts were screened for eligibility against inclusion criteria, and a full text review was conducted of all eligible studies. Data were extracted, and a quality assessment was conducted of all included studies. The qualitative papers were thematically analyzed. Attitudes, barriers, and facilitating factors extracted from the quantitative papers were categorized within the qualitative thematic framework. Results The search resulted in the identification of 9676 titles. After duplicates were removed, abstracts screened, and full texts reviewed, 15 studies were included. Four themes were identified which related to negative clinician attitudes and barriers to active cancer treatment CPG adherence: (1) concern over CPG content and currency of CPGs; (2) concern about the evidence underpinning CPGs; (3) clinician uncertainty and negative perceptions of CPGs; and (4) organizational and patient factors. The review also identified four themes related to positive attitudes and facilitators to active cancer treatment CPG adherence: (5) CPG accessibility and ease of use; (6) endorsement and dissemination of CPGs and adequate access to treatment facilities and resources; (7) awareness of CPGs and belief in their relevance; and (8) belief that CPGs support decision making, improve patient care, reduce clinical variation, and reduce costs. Conclusion These results highlight that adherence to active cancer treatment CPG recommendations by oncology clinicians is influenced by multiple factors such as attitudes, practices, and access to resources. The review has also revealed many similarities and differences in the factors associated with general CPG, and active cancer treatment CPG, adherence. These findings will inform tailored implementation strategies to increase adherence to cancer treatment CPGs.

{"title":"Parental experiences and coping strategies when caring for a child receiving paediatric palliative care: a qualitative study","abstract":"Parenting and providing extensive care to a child with a life-limiting or life-threatening disease while being aware of the future loss of the child are among the most stressful parental experiences. Due to technical and medical improvements, children are living longer and are increasingly cared for at home. To align healthcare professionals' support with the needs of parents, a clear understanding of prominent experiences and main coping strategies of parents caring for a child in need of palliative care is needed. An interpretative qualitative study using thematic analysis was performed. Single or repeated interviews were undertaken with 42 parents of 24 children with malignant or non-malignant diseases receiving palliative care. Prominent reported parental experiences were daily anxiety of child loss, confrontation with loss and related grief, ambiguity towards uncertainty, preservation of a meaningful relationship with their child, tension regarding end-of-life decisions and engagement with professionals. Four closely related coping strategies were identified: suppressing emotions by keeping the loss of their child at bay, seeking support, taking control to arrange optimal childcare and adapting to and accepting the ongoing change(s).Conclusion: Parents need healthcare professionals who understand and carefully handle their worries, losses, parent-child relationship and coping strategies. What is Known: \u2022 In paediatric palliative care, parents have a daunting task in fulfilling all caregiving tasks while striving for control of their child's symptoms, a life worth living and a family balance. What is New: \u2022 Prominent experiences were: continuous management of anxiety of child loss, feelings of uncertainty, tension with end-of-life decision making and engagement with professionals. Parents experienced unique significance to their child, reinforcing a meaningful parent-child relationship. \u2022 Relevant coping strategies were: suppressing emotions, seeking support, taking control to arrange optimal care and adapting to the ongoing changes. \u2022 To provide tailored support, professionals need to understand parents' perceptions, relationship with their child and coping strategies.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007\/s00431-019-03393-w.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Cancer treatment decision-making among young adults with lung and colorectal cancer: a comparison with adults in middle age","abstract":"Our aim is to understand experiences with treatment decision-making among young adults with cancer.We studied patients with lung cancer or colorectal cancer in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium, a prospective cohort study. We identified 148 young adult patients aged 21-40 years who completed baseline interview questions about cancer treatment decision-making; each was propensity score matched to three middle adult patients aged 41-60 years, for a cohort of 592 patients. Patients were asked about decision-making preferences, family involvement in decision-making, and worries about treatment. An ordinal logistic regression model evaluated factors associated with more treatment worries.Young and middle-aged adults reported similar decision-making preferences (p = 0.80) and roles relative to physicians (p = 0.36). Although family involvement was similar in the age groups (p = 0.21), young adults were more likely to have dependent children in the home (60% younger versus 28% middle-aged adults, p < 0.001). Young adults reported more worries about time away from family (p = 0.002), and, in unadjusted analyses, more cancer treatment-related worries (mean number of responses of 'somewhat' or 'very' worried 2.5 for younger versus 2.2 for middle-aged adults, p = 0.02.) However, in adjusted analyses, worries were associated with the presence of dependent children in the home (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% CI = 1.07-2.24, p = 0.02), rather than age.Young adults involve doctors and family members in decisions at rates similar to middle-aged adults but experience more worries about time away from family. Patients with dependent children are especially likely to experience worries. Treatment decision-making strategies should be based on individual preferences and needs rather than age alone.

{"title":"Approach to the Thyroid Cancer Patient with Extracervical Metastases","abstract":"Patients with distant, or extracervical, metastases from differentiated thyroid cancer require multimodality diagnostic, therapeutic, and monitoring approaches. Whereas cure is the initial goal, especially in those with small, radioiodine-avid pulmonary metastases, improved survival and management of symptoms become the primary objective in many patients with persistent disease, especially those with bone metastases. Levothyroxine therapy with suppression of serum TSH is a primary therapy in all patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer, and this therapy has been shown to improve overall survival and slow disease progression. Radioiodine is also an important systemic therapy for those patients with radioiodine-avid disease who respond to this targeted therapy. In this review, we compare standard fixed-dose radioiodine therapy vs. the dosimetric approach. Directed therapy such as external beam radiotherapy, surgery, and embolization is generally considered for large or painful lesions. Careful collaborations with multiple specialties through tumor boards or other mechanisms help to optimize complex management decisions in these patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Multimodality monitoring focused on the organ of interest such as pulmonary [computed tomography (CT)], bone (magnetic resonance imaging, CT, bone scan), and brain (CT, magnetic resonance imaging) metastases as well as general metastatic surveillance (bone scan, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography) aid decision making about careful monitoring vs. directed or systemic therapy. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging has an additional role in patient prognosis and guiding directed therapy for fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lesions. Patients with asymptomatic, stable, radioiodine-resistant metastases may be carefully monitored for disease progression. Patients with symptomatic disease should receive directed therapy with the goal of symptom relief. Patients with progressive metastatic disease should be considered for clinical trials or targeted systemic therapy (sorafenib or sunitinib), although these agents are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for patients with thyroid cancer. The goals of therapy for patients with extracervical metastases should be to improve survival, relieve symptoms, and decrease the morbidity of disease progression and limit the morbidity associated with therapy.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jcem\/article-pdf\/95\/3\/987\/9064749\/jcem0987.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Predicting the need for end-of-life care for elderly cancer patients: findings from a Dutch regional cancer registry database","abstract":"Over 80% of all deaths in the Netherlands concern people aged 65 years and older. Elderly patients who have been diagnosed with a life-limiting illness have many unmet healthcare needs in the last phase of their life. For this exploratory population-based study, data from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry were retrospectively analysed to determine possible trends in the number, patient characteristics, treatment and survival of patients aged 65 years and older newly diagnosed with stage IV cancer (n= 9028), a group of elderly in the palliative phase of cancer. During 1996-2006 a substantial increase of 81% in the number of elderly patients newly diagnosed with cancer stage IV was found. Over 70% of these patients received primary cancer treatment, irrespective of serious comorbidity (in 61% of them) and a short life expectancy (most died within 12 months except for those with cancer of the prostate). The vast increase in the number of the elderly who need palliative care contributes to awareness among healthcare professionals about future demand. They enable anticipation and planning sufficient end-of-life care capacity, but also to develop care planning programmes for these older palliative cancer patients. Research needs to be done on aspects of the symptom burden, role of palliative treatment, psychological, social and spiritual needs and end-of-life decision-making.

{"title":"Empowering Latina breast cancer patients to make informed decisions about clinical trials: a pilot study","abstract":"Minority representation in clinical trials is vital for researchers to assess differential effects in outcomes of therapies on biological and genetic characteristics among groups. This study assessed the effect of Choices, a bilingual multi-component intervention, on perceived understanding of clinical trials, agreement with stages of decision readiness and consideration of clinical trials as a treatment option, among Latina breast cancer patients. This randomized controlled pilot study compared Choices with a control condition providing general clinical trial information to eligible patients. Seventy-seven Latina breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to either Choices (n = 38) or the control (n = 39). Choices included three components: an educational interactive video, a low-literacy booklet, and care coordination by patient navigation (i.e., educational and psychosocial support, coordinating appointments, translating, interacting with the medical team). Choices was more effective than the control in improving perceived understanding of clinical trials (p = .033) and increasing consideration of clinical trials as a treatment option (p = .008). Additionally, intervention participants showed significant changes between baseline and post-intervention on agreement with stages of decision readiness statements (p < .002) than control participants (p > .05); the percentage of intervention women in agreement with preparation to action statements increased from 52.8% at baseline to 86.1% at post-intervention, and those in agreement with ready to action stages rose from 50.0% to 88.9%. Computer-based videos and care coordination provided by patient navigation-specifically tailored to Latinos-are effective strategies to successfully address awareness, and improved decision-making skills to make informed decisions about clinical trial participation.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc6257071?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Reliability of health-related quality-of-life assessments made by older adults and significant others for health states of increasing cognitive impairment","abstract":"Older adults are encouraged by many organizations to engage in advance care planning in the event of decisional incapacity. Planning for future health care often involves anticipating health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in states of reduced cognitive functioning. No study has yet examined whether anticipated HRQoL is stable over time. The accuracy with which significant others can predict how an older adult envisions HRQoL in a future state of cognitive impairment is also unknown. We investigated the extent to which health-related quality-of-life ratings made by older adults and designated proxies for health states of increasing cognitive impairment are consistent over time and agree with each other.Results are based on HRQoL ratings made on a 5-point Likert scale by 235 community-based elder-proxy dyads on three occasions. Ratings were obtained for the older adult's current health state as well as under the assumption that he\/she had a mild to moderate stroke, incurable brain cancer or severe dementia. Data were analyzed using both traditional approaches (e.g., intraclass correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman plots) and the theory of generalizability.We found ratings to be reasonably consistent over time and in good agreement within dyads, even more so as implied cognitive functioning worsened. Across health states, ratings over time or within elder-proxy dyads were no more than one category apart in over 87% of cases. Using the theory of generalizability, we further found that, of the two facets investigated, rater had a greater influence on score variability than occasion.These findings underscore the importance of discussing health-related quality-of-life issues during advance care planning and involving designated proxies in the discussion to enhance their understanding of the role that HRQoL should play in actual decision-making situations. Medical decision-making may be influenced by healthcare providers' and family members' assessments of an incapacitated patient's health-related quality of life, in addition to that of the designated proxy. Future studies should investigate whether these two groups of individuals share the views of the patient and the designated proxy on anticipated HRQoL.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s12955-016-0579-3"},"label_included":0}

The control preference scale was used to assess patient preferences for involvement in treatment decisions, and whether a request by patients for prognostic information during consultation was made, was also recorded. All of the patients were surveyed at the time of diagnosis before receiving treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess how sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data related to decision-making preferences and requests for prognostic information. Relationship with the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) profile was also examined.A total of 280 patients were enrolled, 74% with intermediate-2 and 26% with high-risk IPSS. The mean age of patients was 70-year old (range: 32-89 years). One hundred thirty-two patients (47%) favored a passive role in treatment decision-making, whereas only 14% favored an active role. The remaining 39% of patients favored a shared decision-making approach. Patients with lower hemoglobin levels were more likely to prefer a passive role (P=0.037). HRQOL was generally better in patients preferring an active role versus those preferring a passive one. Overall, 61% (N=171) of patients requested prognostic information on survival during consultation. The likelihood of not requesting prognostic information was higher for older patients (P = 0.003) and for those with lower education (P=0.010).Decision-making preferences vary among patients with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS. Current findings suggest that patients with worse underlying health conditions are more likely to prefer less involvement in treatment decisions.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/annonc\/mdt557"},"label_included":0}

Participants completed a 17-item survey assessing sociodemographic and other factors potentially influencing decision-making regarding trial participation.The sample of 67 participants was mainly male (n = 62, 92.5%), non-Hispanic (89.5%) and white (67.2%), with a mean age of 48.3 years. About half of participants were screened for lymphoma studies. Nearly all (98.5%) of the participants learned about AMC clinical trials from a medical provider, most (73.1%) knew little about clinical trials in general, and half decided on trial participation on their own. Altruism was the most frequently cited reason for trial participation. Participant recommendations for improving AMC trial accrual included systems changes to speed access to clinical trials and reduce participant burden.This formative study highlights the perceived benefits to others, i.e. altruism, as an important factor in trial decision-making, little knowledge about clinical trials in general, and the role of physicians in informing participants about clinical trials. Future research should address knowledge barriers and explore systems- and provider-level factors affecting accrual to AMC trials.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc6428211?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Deciding about fertility preservation after specialist counselling","abstract":"How do female patients experience fertility preservation (FP) consultation (FPC) with a specialist in reproductive medicine and subsequent decision-making on FP?Most patients had positive experiences with FPC, but negative experiences were found to be associated with decisional conflict and decision regret.When confronted with a need for gonadotoxic treatment, girls and young women will have to make an irreversible decision with regard to FP. Patients may experience decisional conflict and develop regret about their decision during follow-up. Patients' opportunities to ask questions during FPC and their knowledge about FP have been inversely related to decisional conflict.A questionnaire on experiences with FPC, designed after qualitative research, was retrospectively distributed to 108 patients to whom FP was offered after FPC between July 2008 and July 2013. Aiming to minimize recall bias, we defined a subgroup of patients counselled since 2011 who had not yet tried to conceive after FPC.Patients were aged \u226516 years and had either cancer or a benign disease that required gonadotoxic therapy. They received FPC in a single university hospital in the Netherlands. Apart from patients' experiences, patients' characteristics, decisional conflict and decision regret were assessed.A total of 64 patients (59.3%) responded to the questionnaire. Patients generally had positive experiences with FPC, but indicated room for improvement. Negative experiences were associated with decisional conflict regarding the FP decision (not enough time for counselling: P < 0.0001; not having the opportunity to ask all questions during FPC: P < 0.0001; not feeling supported by the counsellor during decision-making: P = 0.0003; not all applicable options were discussed: P = 0.0001; benefits and disadvantages of FP options were not clearly explained: P = 0.0005).

In the subgroup of patients counselled after 2011 who had not tried to conceive (n = 33), similar results as for the total study population were found for the association of patient experiences with decisional conflict.Given our retrospective design, we were not informed about the causality of the associations observed. We studied Dutch patients who were counselled in a single centre and were at least 16 years old when filling in the questionnaire. This may limit the generalizability of our data to other settings and populations.More attention should be paid to improving FPC care. Interventions aiming at improving patients' comprehension of the topic of FP and their feelings of being supported in decision-making are advisable.This work was supported by the Radboud Institute for Health and an unconditional grant from Merck Serono.

{"title":"Development and evaluation of a web-based breast cancer cultural competency course for primary healthcare providers","abstract":"To develop and evaluate a continuing medical education (CME) course aimed at improving healthcare provider knowledge about breast cancer health disparities and the importance of cross-cultural communication in provider-patient interactions about breast cancer screening.An interactive web-based CME course was developed and contained information about breast cancer disparities, the role of culture in healthcare decision making, and demonstrated a model of cross-cultural communication. A single group pre-\/post-test design was used to assess knowledge changes. Data on user satisfaction was also collected.In all, 132 participants registered for the CME with 103 completing both assessments. Differences between pre-\/post-test show a significant increase in knowledge (70% vs. 94%; p < .001). Ninety-five percent of participants agreed that the web based training was an appropriate tool to train healthcare providers about cultural competency and health disparities.There was an overall high level of satisfaction among all users. Users felt that learning objectives were met and the web-based format was appropriate and easy to use and suggests that web-based CME formats are an appropriate tool to teach cultural competency skills. However, more information is needed to understand how the CME impacted practice behaviors.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1472-6920-11-59"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Perceptions about screening for prostate cancer using genetic lifetime risk assessment: a qualitative study","abstract":"Most health authorities do not recommend screening for prostate cancer with PSA tests in asymptomatic patients who are not at increased risk. However, opportunistic screening for prostate cancer is still wanted by many patients and it is widely used in primary care clinics, with potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Better tools for risk assessment have been called for, to better target such opportunistic screening. Our aim was to explore perceptions about prostate cancer risk and subsequent opportunistic screening among patients who were not at increased risk of prostate cancer after a first PSA test plus a genetic lifetime risk assessment.We undertook semi-structured patient interviews with recording and verbatim transcription of interviews. Data were analysed thematically.Three themes were identified: uncertainty of the nature of prostate cancer; perceived benefits of testing; and conflicting public health recommendations. Prostate cancer was spoken of as an inescapable risk in older age. The aphorism \"you die with it, not from it\" was prominent in the interviews but patients focused on the benefits of testing now rather than the future risks associated with treatment relating to potential overdiagnosis. Many expressed frustration with perceived mixed messages about early detection of cancer, in which on one side men feel that they are encouraged to seek medical testing to act responsibly regarding the most common cancer disease in men, and on the other side they are asked to refrain from opportunistic testing for prostate cancer. Taken together, personal risks of prostate cancer were perceived as high in spite of a normal PSA test and a genetic lifetime risk assessment showing no increased risk.Patients saw prostate cancer risk as high and increasing with age. They focused on the perceived benefit of early detection using PSA testing. It was also commonly acknowledged that most cases are indolent causing no symptoms and not shortening life expectancy. There was a frustration with mixed messages about the benefit of early detection and risk of overdiagnosis. These men's genetic lifetime risk assessment showing no increased risk did not appear to influence current intentions to get PSA testing in the future.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12875-018-0717-6"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Factors associated with oncology patients' involvement in shared decision making during chemotherapy","abstract":"Oncology patients are increasingly encouraged to play an active role in treatment decision making. While previous studies have evaluated relationships between demographic characteristics and decision-making roles, less is known about the association of symptoms and psychological adjustment characteristics (eg, coping styles and personality traits) and decision-making roles.As part of a larger study of symptom clusters, patients (n = 765) receiving chemotherapy for breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological, or lung cancer provided information on demographic, clinical, symptom, and psychological adjustment characteristics. Patient-reported treatment decision-making roles (ie, preferred role and role actually played) were assessed using the Control Preferences Scale. Differences among patients, who were classified as passive, collaborative, or active, were evaluated using \u03c72 analyses and analyses of variance.Over half (56.3%) of the patients reported that they both preferred and actually played a collaborative role. Among those patients with concordant roles, those who were older, those with less education and lower income, and those who were less resilient were more likely to prefer a passive role. Several psychological adjustment characteristics were associated with decision-making role, including coping style, personality, and fatalism.Oncology patients' preferences for involvement in treatment decision making are associated with demographic characteristics as well as with symptoms and psychological adjustment characteristics, such as coping style and personality. These results reaffirm the complexities of predicting patients' preferences for involvement in decision making. Further study is needed to determine if role or coping style may be influenced by interventions designed to teach adaptive coping skills.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/escholarship.org\/content\/qt4gw3x9sx\/qt4gw3x9sx.pdf?t=qaq0cs"},"label_included":1}
{"title":"Staged Improvement in Awareness of Disease for Elderly Cancer Patients in Southern China","abstract":"In mainland China, awareness of disease of elderly cancer patients largely relies on the patients' families. We developed a staged procedure to improve their awareness of disease.Participants were 224 elderly cancer patients from 9 leading hospitals across Southern China. A questionnaire was given to the oncologists in charge of each patient to evaluate the interaction between family and patients, patient awareness of their disease and participation in medical decision-making. After first cycles of treatment, increased information of disease was given to patients with cooperation of the family. Then patient awareness of their disease and participation in medical decision-making was documented.Among the 224 cancer elderly patients, 26 (11.6%) made decisions by themselves and 125 (55.8%) delegated their rights of decision- making to their family. Subordinate family members tended to play a passive role in decision-making significantly. Patients participating more in medical decision-making tended to know more about their disease. However, in contrast to the awareness of disease, patient awareness of violation of medical recommendations was reversely associated with their participation in medical decision-making. Improvement in awareness of diagnosis, stages and prognosis was achieved in about 20% elderly cancer patients. About 5% participated more actively in medical decision-making.Chinese elderly cancer patient awareness of disease and participation in medical decision-making is limited and relies on their family status. The staged procedure we developed to improve patient awareness of disease proved effective.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"http:\/\/society.kisti.re.kr\/sv\/SV_svpsbs03V.do?method=download&cn1=JAKO201534168452270"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The cognitive and behavioral effects of meningioma lesions involving the ventromedial prefrontal cortex","abstract":"OBJECT Anterior skull base meningiomas are frequently associated with changes in personality and behavior. Although such meningiomas often damage the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which is important for higher cognition, the cognitive and behavioral effects of these meningiomas remain poorly understood. Using detailed neuropsychological assessments in a large series of patients, this study examined the cognitive and behavioral effects of meningioma lesions involving the vmPFC. METHODS The authors reviewed neuropsychology and lesion mapping records of 70 patients who underwent resection of meningiomas. The patients were drawn from the Neurological Patient Registry at the University of Iowa. Patients were sorted into 2 groups: those with lesions involving the vmPFC and those with lesions that did not involve the vmPFC. Neuropsychological data pertaining to a comprehensive array of cognitive and behavioral domains were available preoperatively in 20 patients and postoperatively in all 70 patients. RESULTS No change occurred in basic cognitive functions (e.g., attention, perception, memory, construction and motor performance, language, or executive functions) from the preoperative to postoperative epochs for the vmPFC and non-vmPFC groups. There was a significant decline in the behavioral domain, specifically adaptive function, for both the vmPFC and non-vmPFC groups, and this decline was more pronounced for the vmPFC group. Additionally, postoperative data indicated that the vmPFC group had a specific deficit in value-based decision making, as evidenced by poor performance on the Iowa Gambling Task, compared with the non-vmPFC group. The vmPFC and non-vmPFC groups did not differ postoperatively on other cognitive measures, including intellect, memory, language, and perception. CONCLUSIONS Lesions of the vmPFC resulting from meningiomas are associated with specific deficits in adaptive function and value-based decision making. Meningioma patients showed a decline in adaptive function postoperatively, and this decline was especially notable in patients with vmPFC region meningiomas. Early detection and resection of meningiomas of the anterior skull base (involving the gyrus rectus) may prevent these deficits.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/thejns.org\/downloadpdf\/journals\/j-neurosurg\/124\/6\/article-p1568.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Is seeing a specialist nurse associated with positive experiences of care? The role and value of specialist nurses in prostate cancer care","abstract":"Specialist nurses may play an important role in helping to improve the experiences of patients with prostate cancer, however there is concern that the specialist nurse role is under threat in the UK due to financial pressures in the NHS. This study explored the role and value of specialist nurses in prostate cancer care via a survey and patient interviews.This paper reports findings from two studies. A survey of patients from three hospitals across the UK (289\/481, 60%), investigated whether patients who saw a specialist nurse had different experiences of information provision and involvement in decision-making, to those who did not. Qualitative interviews were also carried out with 35 men recently tested or treated for prostate cancer, recruited from two hospitals in the UK. Interviews explored patients' views on the role and value of the specialist nurse.Survey findings indicated that patients who saw a specialist nurse had more positive experiences of receiving written information about tests and treatment, and about sources of advice and support, and were more likely to say they made the treatment decision themselves. In interviews, patients described specialist nurse input in their care in terms of providing information and support immediately post-diagnosis, as well as being involved in ongoing care. Two key aspects of the specialist nurse role were seen as unique: their availability to the patient, and their ability to liaise between the patient and the medical system.This study indicates the unique role that specialist nurses play in the experience of patients with prostate cancer, and highlights the importance of maintaining specialist nurse roles in prostate cancer care.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1472-6963-8-65"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Comparative analysis of target gene exon sequencing by cognitive technology using a next generation sequencing platform in patients with lung cancer","abstract":"Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology is an increasingly important clinical tool for therapeutic decision\u2011making. However, interpretation of NGS data presents challenges at the point of care, due to limitations in understanding the clinical importance of gene variants and efficiently translating results into actionable information for the clinician. The present study compared two approaches for annotating and reporting actionable genes and gene mutations from tumor samples: The traditional approach of manual curation, annotation and reporting using an experienced molecular tumor bioinformationist; and a cloud\u2011based cognitive technology, with the goal to detect gene mutations of potential significance in Chinese patients with lung cancer. Data from 285 gene\u2011targeted exon sequencing previously conducted on 115 patient tissue samples between 2014 and 2016 and subsequently manually annotated and evaluated by the Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute (GLCI) research team were analyzed by the Watson for Genomics (WfG) cognitive genomics technology. A comparative analysis of the annotation results of the two methods was conducted to identify quantitative and qualitative differences in the mutations generated. The complete congruence rate of annotation results between WfG analysis and the GLCI bioinformatician was 43.48%. In 65 (56.52%) samples, WfG analysis identified and interpreted, on average, 1.54 more mutation sites in each sample than the manual GLCI review. These mutation sites were located on 27 genes, including <em>EP300<\/em>, <em>ARID1A<\/em>, <em>STK11<\/em> and <em>DNMT3A<\/em>. Mutations in the EP300 gene were most prevalent, and present in 30.77% samples. The Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) interpreted by WfG analysis (1.82) was significantly higher than the TMB (0.73) interpreted by GLCI review. Compared with manual curation by a bioinformatician, WfG analysis provided comprehensive insights and additional genetic alterations to inform clinical therapeutic strategies for patients with lung cancer. These findings suggest the valuable role of cognitive computing to increase efficiency in the comprehensive detection and interpretation of genetic alterations which may inform opportunities for targeted cancer therapies.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.spandidos-publications.com\/10.3892\/mco.2020.2198\/download"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Changes in conditional net survival and dynamic prognostic factors in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer initially treated with androgen deprivation therapy","abstract":"Background The purpose of this study was to identify predictive factors associated with conditional net survival in patients with metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer (mHNPC) initially treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Methods At nine hospitals in Tohoku, Japan, the medical records of 605 consecutive patients with mHNPC who initially received ADT were retrospectively reviewed. The Pohar Perme estimator was used to calculate conditional net cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) for up to 5 years subsequent to the diagnosis. Using multiple imputation, proportional hazard ratios for conditional CSS and OS were calculated with adjusted Cox regression models. Results During a median follow up of 2.95 years, 208 patients died, of which 169 died due to progressive prostate cancer. At baseline, the 5-year CSS and OS rates were 65.5% and 58.2%, respectively. Conditional 5-year net CSS and OS survival gradually increased for all the patients. In patients given a 5-year survivorship, the conditional 5-year net CSS and OS rates improved to 0.906 and 0.811, respectively. Only the extent of disease score (EOD) \u22652 remained a prognostic factor for CSS and OS up to 5 years; as survival time increased, other variables were no longer independent prognostic factors. Conclusions The conditional 5-year net CSS and OS in patients with mHNPC gradually increased; thus, the risk of mortality decreased with increasing survival. The patient's risk profile changed over time. EOD remained an independent prognostic factor for CSS and OS after 5-year follow-up. Conditional net survival can play a role in clinical decision-making, providing intriguing information for cancer survivors.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1002\/cam4.2502"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The clinical-care focused psychological interview (CLiC): a structured tool for the assessment of cancer patients\u2019 needs","abstract":"Integrating the psychosocial perspective in oncology is warranted. Here, we introduce a structured psychological intervention, the clinical-care focused psychological interview (CLiC), to address patients' needs in the relationship with health professionals, clinical pathway and decision-making process. The perceived utility and feasibility of the CLiC were evaluated in a preliminary sample of 30 patients who were candidates to undergo a radical cystectomy at the European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy. Patients reported a very high satisfaction with the interview, because it prepared them for their upcoming surgery by gathering more information about their clinical pathway and allowed them to discover the information they still needed. 30% stated that CLiC helped them to reorganise their thoughts and 36.7% understood the role of psychological intervention in the clinical pathway. Only 20% considered the CLiC useful in helping to build their relationship with the clinical staff. Before an invasive surgery such as radical cystectomy, patients' need for information regarding the upcoming surgery seems to prevail. Knowing the future consequences and adjusting toward the disease could be paramount for patients in facing uncertainty and they might feel that creating a relationship with physicians could be a secondary issue. However, our data show that a structured psychological intervention such as the CLiC interview can collect important information for patients and healthcare professionals to develop real patient-centred care.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/ecancer.org\/en\/journal\/article\/1000-the-clinical-care-focused-psychological-interview-clic-a-structured-tool-for-the-assessment-of-cancer-patients-needs\/pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Patient Age, Well-Being, Perspectives, and Care Practices in the Early Treatment Phase for Late-Stage Cancer","abstract":"Among advanced-stage cancer patients, age is an important determinant of decision making about medical care. We examined age-related differences in patient well-being, care perspectives, and preferences, and the relationship between these patient characteristics and subsequent care practices including care communication, pain management, and acute care utilization during the early treatment phase of late-stage cancer.Patient demographics, well-being, and care perspectives were assessed during patient and physician baseline interviews. Care practices were measured using outpatient and inpatient records for the 30-day period after baseline assessment. Multivariate regression models were used to examine the patterns of association of age and other patient characteristics with care practices.A total of 174 middle-aged and 149 older patients with recently diagnosed late-stage cancer were included. Older patients had more comorbidities but lower levels of depression, anxiety, and symptom distress. Older patients preferred pain relief\/comfort as a treatment goal, but received fewer prescriptions for opioids. Whereas provider-initiated communication with patients\/families was positively associated with severity of illness, patient\/family-initiated communication was associated with patient psychosocial attributes and care perspectives. Satisfaction with care was inversely associated with reports of pain. Symptom distress was positively associated with subsequent opioid prescriptions and hospitalizations.Our results help to explain the role of patients' psychosocial attributes, care perspectives, and preferences in subsequent care practices during the early treatment phase for late-stage cancer. Age-related differences in patient well-being and care perspectives suggest a role for age-sensitive interventions in the treatment of advanced cancer patients.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/biomedgerontology\/article-pdf\/63\/9\/960\/9733164\/960.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Role of diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ovary with cancerous peritonitis: case report and review of the literature","abstract":"Abstract Background Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is a very rare ovarian neoplasm that has a poor clinical outcome even in the early stage, and there is as yet no established treatment. Diagnostic laparoscopy has been used to determine the possibility of primary optimal cytoreductive surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. However, the role of diagnostic laparoscopy is still unclear in large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma due to its rarity. Case presentation A 31-year-old woman with abdominal distention was referred to our hospital. She was strongly suspected of having advanced ovarian cancer because of a huge pelvic mass, massive ascites, and their appearance on medical imaging. However, cytological examinations from ascitic fluid by abdominal paracentesis did not show any malignant cells. She underwent diagnostic laparoscopy to evaluate the possibility of primary optimal cytoreductive surgery, and only tissue sampling was performed for pathological diagnosis because of the countless disseminated lesions of various sizes in the intraperitoneal organs. The patient had no postoperative complications, leading to the early start of postoperative chemotherapy. Conclusions To date, there have been no systematic reviews that focused on determining the treatment strategy using laparoscopy. Diagnostic laparoscopy can be helpful to determine the optimal treatment, including primary debulking surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or best supportive care, assisting in decision-making particularly for patients with advanced large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with carcinomatous peritonitis.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s13048-019-0571-8"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"What does risk of future cancer mean to breast cancer patients?","abstract":"Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients greatly overestimate their risk of developing contralateral breast cancer (CBC). Better understanding of patient conceptions of risk would facilitate doctor-patient communication and surgical decision making. In this mixed methods study, we prospectively examined breast cancer patients' perceived risk of future cancer and the reported factors that drove their risk perceptions.Women age 21-60 diagnosed with breast cancer without a BRCA mutation or known distant metastases completed a study interview between surgical consult and surgical treatment. Participants completed a 12-item Perceived Risk Questionnaire, which assessed 10-year and lifetime risks of ipsilateral local recurrence, CBC, and distant recurrence. Patients provided qualitative explanations for their answers.Sixty-three patients completed study interviews (mean age 50.3). Participants were primarily White (85.7%) and 90.5% had attended college. Patients estimated their 10-year risk of CBC as 22.0%, nearly 4 times the established 10-year risk. Women attributed their risk perceptions to \"gut feelings\" about future cancer, even when women knew those feelings contradicted medically established risk. Perceptions of risk also reflected beliefs that cancer is random and that risk for local recurrence, CBC, and distant recurrence are the same.Our findings point to the need for novel ways of presenting factual information regarding both risk of recurrence and of new primary cancers, as well as the necessity of acknowledging cognitive and affective processes many patients use when conceptualizing risk. By differentiating women's intuitive feelings about risk from their knowledge of medically estimated risk, doctors can enhance informed decision making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc6535122?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The relation between cancer patient treatment decision-making roles and quality of life","abstract":"BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to explore relations between patient role preferences during the cancer treatment decision-making process and quality of life (QOL). METHODS One-year cancer survivors completed a survey in 2000 as part of a larger survey conducted by the American Cancer Society. The current report was based on survey respondents from Minnesota (response rate, 37.4%). Standardized measures included the Profile of Mood States (scores were converted to have a range, from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating the best mood), the Medical Outcomes Survey 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) (standardized scores), and the Control Preferences Scale. Patients' actual and preferred role preference distributions and concordance between roles were compared with QOL scores using 2-sample t test methodology. RESULTS The actual role of survivors (n = 594) in cancer care was 33% active, 50% collaborative, and 17% passive. Their preferred role was 35% active, 53% collaborative, and 13% passive. Overall, 88% of survivors had concordant preferred and actual roles. Survivors who had concordant roles had higher SF-36 Physical Component Scale (PCS) scores (P < .01), higher vitality (P = .01), less fatigue (P < .01), less confusion (P = .01), less anger (P = .046), and better overall mood (P = .01). These results were similar among both women and younger individuals (aged <60 years). Survivors who had active actual roles had higher PCS scores (P < .01), less tension (P = .04), and higher vitality (P = .04) than survivors who were either collaborative or passive. No differences existed in QOL scores according to preferred role. CONCLUSIONS Survivors who experienced discordance between their actual role and their preferred role reported substantial QOL deficits in both physical and emotional domains.

We conducted a four-arm randomized controlled trial to test the impact of a novel video invitation on participant response. We invited childhood cancer survivors and parents of survivors <16 years to complete questionnaires. We compared response rates to an invitation letter (control) vs receiving the letter plus a video invitation on a flash drive presented by a childhood cancer survivor, a pediatric oncologist or a researcher. We explored factors associated with viewing the video and examined the impact of enclosing the USB on study costs. Overall 54% (634\/1176) of questionnaires were returned. Participants who received a video invitation on a USB were more likely to return the questionnaire than those who did not (58% vs 47%, P < .001). Participation rate did not significantly differ by video presenter. Forty-seven percent of participants who received a USB reported watching the video, of whom 48% reported that the video influenced their decision to participate. Participants with a lower income (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.25-0.74, P = .002) were more likely to report watching the video. Participants who received a video invitation required significantly fewer reminder calls than those who only received a written invitation (mean = 1.6 vs 1.1 calls, P < .001), resulting in a 25% recruitment cost-saving for the study. Adding a USB with a video study invitation to recruitment packages is a cost-effective way of improving study participation.

{"title":"Evaluating the role of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography in multi-disciplinary team recommendations for oesophago-gastric cancer","abstract":"National guidelines recommend that fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is performed in all patients being considered for radical treatment of oesophageal or oesophago-gastric cancer without computerised tomography scan (CTS) evidence of metastasis. Guidance also mandates that all patients with cancer have treatment decisions made within the context of a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting. Little is known, however, about the influence of PET-CT on decision making within MDTs. The aim of this study was to assess the role of PET-CT in oesophago-gastric cancer on MDT decision making.A retrospective analysis of a prospectively held database of all patients with biopsy-proven oesophageal or oesophago-gastric cancer discussed by a specialist MDT was interrogated. Patients selected for radical treatment without CTS evidence of M1 disease were identified. The influence of PET-CT on MDT decision making was examined by establishing whether the PET-CT confirmed CTS findings of M0 disease (and did not change the patient staging pathway) or whether the PET-CT changed the pathway by showing unsuspected M1 disease, refuting CTS suspicious metastases, or identifying another lesion (needing further investigation).In 102 MDT meetings, 418 patients were discussed, of whom 240 were initially considered for radical treatment and 238 undergoing PET-CT. The PET-CT confirmed CTS findings for 147 (61.8%) and changed MDT recommendations in 91 patients (38.2%) by (i) identifying M1 disease (n=43), (ii) refuting CTS suspicions of M1 disease (n=25), and (iii) identifying new lesions required for investigations (n=23).The addition of PET-CT to standard staging for oesophageal cancer led to changes in MDT recommendations in 93 (38.2%) patients, improving patient selection for radical treatment. The validity of the proposed methods for evaluating PET-CT on MDT decision making requires more work in other centres and teams.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/bjc2013478.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Patients\u2019 Perceptions of Gene Expression Profiling in Breast Cancer Treatment Decisions","abstract":"Introduction: Determining the likely benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer patients depends on estimating baseline recurrence risk. Gene expression profile (gep) testing of tumours informs risk prediction, but evidence of its clinical utility is limited. We explored patient perceptions of gep testing and the impact of those perceptions on chemotherapy decisions. Methods: We conducted one focus group (n = 4) and individual interviews (n = 24) with patients who used gep testing, recruited through clinics at two hospitals in Ontario. Data were analyzed using content analysis and constant comparison techniques. Results: Patients\u2019 understanding of gep testing was variable, and misapprehensions were common. Patients valued the test because it provided them with certainty amidst confusion, with options and a sense of empowerment, and with personalized, authoritative information. They commonly believed that the test was better and fundamentally different from other clinical tests, attributing to it unique power and truth-value. This kind of \u201cmagical thinking\u201d was derived from an amplified perception of the test\u2019s validity and patients\u2019 need for reassurance about their treatment choices. Despite misperceptions or magical thinking, gep was widely considered to be the deciding factor in treatment decisions. Conclusions: Patients tend to overestimate the truth-value of gep testing based on misperceptions of its validity. Our results identify a need to better support patient understanding of the test and its limitations. Findings illustrate the deep emotional investment patients make in gep test results and the impact of that investment on their treatment decisions.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3747\/co.21.1524"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Role of Breast Surgery in BRCA Mutation Carriers","abstract":"BRCA mutation carriers have a life-long breast cancer risk between 55 and 85% and a high risk of developing breast cancer at a very young age, depending on the type of mutation. The risk of developing contralateral breast cancer after a first breast cancer is elevated up to 65%, especially in case of BRCA1 mutation and young age at the first breast cancer. Since bilateral prophylactic mastectomy is associated with a risk reduction of 90-95% of developing primary or contralateral breast cancer, this option is a key point within the counseling process for patient information and shared decision-making of mutation carriers. Although the local control after breast-conserving therapy in mutation carriers seems to be comparable to that of sporadic breast cancer patients, individual patient information and counseling should include all alternative procedures of oncologically adequate mastectomy techniques and immediate reconstruction. Excellent cosmetic results, high levels of life quality, and good patient acceptance can be achieved with the recent developments in reconstructive surgery of the breast.

Da eine bilaterale prophylaktische Mastektomie mit einer Risikoreduktion um 90\u201395% f\u00fcr die Entwicklung eines prim\u00e4ren oder auch kontralateralen Mammakarzinoms einhergeht, ist diese Option ein zentrales Thema im Beratungsablauf zur Patientinnenaufkl\u00e4rung und Entscheidungsfindung von Mutationstr\u00e4gerinnen. Auch wenn die lokale Kontrolle nach brusterhaltender Therapie bei Mutationstr\u00e4gerinnen derjenigen bei Frauen mit sporadischem Mammakarzinom vergleichbar ist, sollte die individuelle Patientinneninformation und Beratung alle Alternativen einer onkologisch ad\u00e4quaten Mastektomietechnik mit Sofortrekonstruktion der Brust umfassen. Unter Einsatz der modernen Entwicklungen in der rekonstruktiven Brustchirurgie sind damit hervorragende \u00e4sthetische Ergebnisse bei hoher Lebensqualit\u00e4t sowie eine gute Patientinnenakzeptanz zu erzielen.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/343717"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"What Do Dentists and Dental Students Think of Oral Cancer and Its Control and Prevention Strategies? A Qualitative Study in Jazan Dental School","abstract":"Abstract Jazan region of Saudi Arabia has a high prevalence of oral cancer: 35% of cases. However, little is known about the view of dentists and dental students on possible factors that contribute to this high rate with scarce efforts regarding prevention. The study investigated possible factors related to oral cancer as perceived by dentists and dental students, using a qualitative approach. Six focus groups conducted in Jazan Dental School (JDS) and participants included dental students, interns, faculty members, and key decision-makers. All participants acknowledged oral cancer a serious public health issue in Jazan affecting all ages. The majority thought that tobacco is a major risk factor in this region, which can easily be obtained by individuals of any age or gender. Further, formal dental education in the country is not focusing on the local related risk factors. Participants agreed that practicing oral cancer examination and its risk factors education is related to clinicians\u2019 attitude and skills. Several participants declared that no organized effort established toward oral cancer and its risk factors in the region. Cultural acceptance of oral cancer risk factors was mentioned as one of the challenges for patients. The findings indicate that dental education and training at JDS are not focusing on necessary related oral health issues and their risk factors in the community. Also, it casts a new light on the fact that dentists are not educating their patients because they lack the knowledge and the skill of health education and patients\u2019 communication methods.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007\/s13187-019-01609-z.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Treatment decision-making among patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer: A qualitative study","abstract":"Oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) is now the most common site of head and neck squamous cell cancer. Despite the focus on treatment deintensification in clinical trials, little is known about the preferences, experiences and needs of patients with OPSCC when deciding between surgery and radiation therapy as primary treatment with curative intent. In this qualitative study, pre-treatment and post-treatment oropharyngeal cancer patients were recruited to take part in one-on-one interviews (n = 11 pre-treatment) and focus group discussions (n = 15 post-treatment) about treatment decision-making. Recordings were transcribed and assessed for emergent themes using framework analysis. From the one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions with OPSCC patients, fourteen themes were identified. Participants expressed alarm at diagnosis, decisional conflict, and a variety of roles in decision-making (physician-controlled, shared, and autonomous). Decisions were driven by the perceived recommendation of the treatment team, a desire for physical (surgical) tumor removal, fear of adverse effects of treatment, and patient-specific values. Although participants felt well-informed by their treating physicians, they identified a need for additional patient-centered information. Participants were critical of the poor quality of information available on the internet, and acknowledged the advantage of hearing the experiences of post-treatment patients. The experiences identified herein may be used to guide patient-centered communication during patient counseling and to inform interventions designed to support patients' needs at diagnosis, ultimately helping to implement high-quality, patient-centered care.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8556673"},"label_included":0}

{"title":"Venous access: the patient experience","abstract":"The evolution of venous access via peripheral cannulation, particularly in relation to the risks and the benefits of this procedure, is reported widely in the literature. However, there is limited research specific to the patient experience of undergoing venous access.The intent of this qualitative study was to understand patients' experience of venous access, with the aim of bringing forth their voices about the experiences of repeated venous access\/cannulation attempts.This qualitative study used a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to explore the experiences of 15 participants in two rural oncology units in Australia. The participants had experienced repeated peripheral cannulation in order to receive chemotherapy. Study participants were asked to describe what it was like for them to be repeatedly cannulated. Data were collected via audiotaped individual interviews, the participants' stories were transcribed and analysed thematically.Themes emerged from the participants' stories that provided insights into their perceptions of the experience of being cannulated and the decision-making processes regarding how and where the procedure occurred. The findings suggest that a holistic approach to care was often missing causing the participants to feel vulnerable. Gaining insight into their experiences led to a greater understanding of the impact of this procedure on patients and the need to improve care through encouraging more collaborative decision-making processes between clinicians and patients.The implications for policy and practice focus on improving patient outcomes via procedural governance and education, with the intent of translating the findings from this research into evidence-based practice.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/researchonline.federation.edu.au\/vital\/access\/services\/Download\/vital:10541\/SOURCE2"},"label_included":0}

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting can provide symptomatic relief in this patient subset; however, few studies have examined the role of shunting in the palliation, prognosis and overall oncologic care of these patients.ObjectiveTo identify and evaluate risk factors associated with prognosis after CSF diversion and assess surgical, symptomatic and oncologic outcomes in this population.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted on patients with solid-malignancy LM treated with a shunt at a NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center between 2010 and 2019.ResultsOne hundred and ninety patients with metastatic LM underwent CSF diversion. Overall survival was 4.14 months from LM diagnosis (95% CI: 3.29\u20134.70) and 2.43 months (95% CI: 2.01\u20133.09) from shunting. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) at time of shunting and brain metastases (BrM) number at LM diagnosis demonstrated significant associations with survival (HR = 0.66; 95% CI [0.51\u20130.86], p = 0.002; HR = 1.40; 95% CI [1.01\u20131.93] per 10 BrM, p = 0.04, respectively). Eighty-three percent of patients experienced symptomatic relief, and 79% were discharged home or to rehabilitation facilities post-shunting. Post-shunt, 56% of patients received additional systemic therapy or started or completed WBRT. Complications included infection (5%), symptomatic subdural hygroma\/hematoma (6.3%), and shunt externalization\/removal\/repair (8%). Abdominal seeding was not identified.ConclusionsCSF diversion for LM with hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension secondary to metastasis can achieve symptomatic relief, hospital discharge, and return to further oncologic therapy, with a complication profile unique to this pathophysiology. However, decision-making in this population must incorporate end-of-life goals of care given limited prognosis.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8504535"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"How Does a Shared Decision-Making (SDM) Intervention for Oncologists Affect Participation Style and Preference Matching in Patients with Breast and Colon Cancer?","abstract":"The aims of this study are to assess patients' preferred and perceived decision-making roles and preference matching in a sample of German breast and colon cancer patients and to investigate how a shared decision-making (SDM) intervention for oncologists influences patients' preferred and perceived decision-making roles and the attainment of preference matches. This study is a post hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of an SDM intervention. The SDM intervention was a 12-h SDM training program for physicians in combination with decision board use. For this study, we analysed a subgroup of 107 breast and colon cancer patients faced with serious treatment decisions who provided data on specific questionnaires with regard to their preferred and perceived decision-making roles (passive, SDM or active). Patients filled in questionnaires immediately following a decision-relevant consultation (t1) with their oncologist. Eleven of these patients' 27 treating oncologists had received the SDM intervention within the RCT. A majority of cancer patients (60%) preferred SDM. A match between preferred and perceived decision-making roles was reached for 72% of patients. The patients treated by SDM-trained physicians perceived greater autonomy in their decision making (p < 0.05) with more patients perceiving SDM or an active role, but their preference matching was not influenced. A SDM intervention for oncologists boosted patient autonomy but did not improve preference matching.

{"title":"What is lacking in patient-physician communication: Perspectives from Asian American breast cancer patients and oncologists","abstract":"Interactions between breast cancer patients and their oncologists are important as effective patient-physician communication can facilitate the delivery of quality cancer care. However, little is known about patient-physician communication processes among Asian American breast cancer patients, who may have unique communication needs and challenges. Thus, we interviewed Asian American patients and several oncologists to explore patient-physician communication processes in breast cancer care.We conducted in-depth interviews with nine Chinese- or Korean American breast cancer patients and three Asian American oncologists who routinely provided care for Asian American patients in the Washington DC metropolitan area in 2010. We conducted patient interviews in Chinese or Korean and then translated into English. We conducted physicians' interviews in English. We performed qualitative analyses to identify themes.For women with limited English proficiency, language was the greatest barrier to understanding information and making treatment-related decisions. Both patients and oncologists believed that interpretation provided by patients' family members may not be accurate, and patients may neglect to ask questions because of their worry of burdening others. We observed cultural differences regarding expectations of the doctor's role and views of cancer recovery. As expressed by the patients and observed by oncologists, Asian American women are less likely to be assertive and are mostly reliant on physicians to make treatment decisions. However, many patients expressed a desire to be actively involved in the decision-making process.Findings provide preliminary insight into patient-physician communication and identify several aspects of patient-physician communication that need to be improved for Asian American breast cancer patients. Proper patient education with linguistically and culturally appropriate information and tools may help improve communication and decision-making processes for Asian American women with breast cancer.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc3566873?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Participation of relatives in the care of cancer patients in hospital-A scoping review","abstract":"The purpose of the review was to describe what kind of research has been conducted concerning relatives' participation in the care of cancer patients in hospital and how relatives have participated in the care. Data (n = 9) were identified through a manual search and by searching the electronic databases (n = 8) Cinahl, PubMed and Cochrane Library and analysed with deductive content analysis. According to the review, participation in the concrete care appeared as taking care of comprehensive care and the quality of care, helping with daily activities and helping the healthcare professionals. Emotional support appeared as protecting, supporting and visiting the patient and discussing with the patient. Participation in decision-making appeared as acting as an advocate for the patient, participating in the discussion concerning the decision-making and participating in the discussion concerning the decisions of end of life. According to the review, research concerning this topic seems to be rare. While hospital periods are shortening and homecare is increasing, the role of relatives as a supporter of the cancer patient is becoming even stronger. In the future, more research should be conducted how the patients experience participation and what are their wishes.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/ecc.12821"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Clinical implication of prognostic and predictive biomarkers for castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review","abstract":"Abstract Background Diagnosis of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with current biomarkers is difficult and often results in unnecessary invasive procedures as well as over-diagnosis and over-treatment. There are a number of prognostic biomarkers for CRPC, but there are no validated predictive biomarkers to guide in clinical decision-making. Specific biomarkers are needed that enable to understand the natural history and complex biology of this heterogeneous malignancy, identify early response to treatment outcomes and to identify the population of men most likely to benefit from the treatment. In this systematic review, we discuss the existing literature for the role of biomarkers in CRPC and how they aid in the prognosis, treatment selection and survival outcomes. Methods We performed a literature search on PubMed and EMBASE databases from January 2015 through February 2020 in accordance to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Articles were assessed to identify relevant observational studies and randomized controlled trials regarding biomarkers which aid in identifying progression to mCRPC as well as predictive biomarkers which help in treatment selection. Results We identified 3640 number of hits of which 58 articles were found to be relevant. Here we addressed biomarkers in the context of prognosis, prediction and patient selection of therapy. These biomarkers were found to be effective as prognostic or predictive factors under variety of conditions. The higher levels for all these biomarkers were associated with shorter median OS and sometimes PFS. Lower amounts of biomarkers in serum or urine were associated with prolonged survival outcomes, longer time to CRPC development or CRPC progression and longer median follow-up irrespective of any therapy. Conclusion We observed that the biomarkers included in our study predicted clinically relevant survival outcomes and treatment exposure. Though the current biomarkers are prognostic when measured prior to initiating treatment, not all are validated as predictive markers in post treatment setting. A greater understanding of biomarkers in CRPC is need of the hour for development of more personalized approach to maximize benefit and minimize harm in men with CRPC.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s12935-020-01508-0"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Making decisions about colorectal cancer screening. A qualitative study among citizens with lower educational attainment","abstract":"Few decision aids (DAs) have been developed to support an informed choice to citizens with lower educational attainment about colorectal cancer screening. The aim of this study was to identify information needs and preferences for formats and content in a DA for this group of citizens.Four focus groups were conducted among Danish men and women aged 50-74 years with lower educational attainment. A semi-structured interview guide was developed to explore participants' perceptions about colorectal cancer screening and wishes for a DA. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using an ethnographic approach.The participants appreciated information about the causes, symptoms, incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer compared with other common cancers. The majority preferred the information to be presented in a clear and simple way with numbers and figures kept to a minimum. Values clarification exercises were not found useful. Receiving a screening kit to collect a sample of faeces along with the invitation letter was seen by the participants as a clear request from the health authorities to get screened. However, the overall message in the DA was perceived as ambiguous by the participants as it both recommended screening and seemed to disclaim responsibility for it.The results are relevant to a discussion of the delicate balance between participants' call for a clear recommendation, and the purpose of a DA to present options in a neutral and balanced way. This discussion is relevant beyond the group of citizens with lower educational attainment.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/eurpub\/article-pdf\/26\/1\/176\/7473209\/ckv207.pdf"},"label_included":0}

We compared data derived from different measures of three communication behaviors, patient participation, physician information giving, and physician participatory decision-making (PDM) style, from 83 outpatient visits to oncology or thoracic surgery clinics for pulmonary nodules or lung cancer. Communication was measured with rating scales completed by patients and physicians after the consultation and by two different groups of external observers who used rating scales or coded the frequency of communication behaviors, respectively, after listening to an audio recording of the consultation. Measures were compared using Pearson\u2019s correlations. Correlations of patients\u2019 and physicians\u2019 ratings of patient participation ( r = .04) and physician PDM style ( r = .03) were low and not significant ( p &gt; .0083, Bonferroni-adjusted). Correlations of observers\u2019 ratings with patients\u2019 or physicians\u2019 ratings for patient participation and physician PDM style were moderate or low ( r = .15, .27, .07, and .01, respectively) but were not statistically significant ( p &gt; .0083, Bonferroni-adjusted). Correlations between observers\u2019 ratings and frequency measures were .31, .52, and .63 and were statistically significant with p values .005, &lt;.0001, and &lt;.0001, respectively, for PDM style, information giving, and patient participation.

Accurate re-staging plays the most important role in making a decision on isolated metastasis resection. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography\/computed tomography (PET\/CT) is useful in detecting intra-abdominal implantation metastasis from a variety of malignancies and shows superior accuracy to conventional imaging modalities in determining the location of metastasis. We present one patient with a new isolated pelvic implantation metastasis detected by 18F-FDG PET\/CT and pathologically confirmed by PET\/CT-guided percutaneous biopsy, who had a history of resection of spontaneously ruptured HCC two years ago.

{"title":"Variation in Physician-patient Discussion of Breast Reconstruction","abstract":"For women with early stage breast cancer, physician-patient discussion of breast reconstruction is an essential step in their participation in the decision-making process for their treatments. This study examines sociodemographic variation of physician-patient discussion of breast reconstruction and explores the impact of this discussion on the use of breast reconstruction.We used data from the Los Angeles Women's Study, a population-based study of women 50 years and older with breast cancer. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the impact of patient and hospital characteristics on self-reported receipt of physician-patient discussion and use of breast reconstruction.Of 315 post-mastectomy women, 81% and 27% reported physician-patient discussion and use of breast reconstruction, respectively. In multivariable analysis, women with an annual income <$20,000 were less likely to have physician-patient discussion than women with annual income > or =$40,000 (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.07-0.82). Among the subset of women with physician-patient discussion, chest wall radiation, a known characteristic associated with higher rates of reconstruction complications, became an additional significant negative predictor of reconstruction.Lower income women are at risk of not receiving physician-patient discussion of breast reconstruction. Physician-patient discussion of breast reconstruction appears to decrease the use of breast reconstruction among women with clinical characteristics associated with higher rates of reconstruction complications and failure. This highlights the need for interventions to increase physician-patient discussion of breast reconstruction among lower income women.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc2607520?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}

We prospectively compared younger (40-64 years) versus older (\u2265 65 years) breast cancer patients' preferences for decision-making roles and their perceived actual roles.A prospective multicenter study was conducted in Leiden, The Hague, and Tilburg over a 2-year period. Early-stage breast cancer patients were surveyed about their preferred and perceived decision-making roles (active, shared, or passive) concerning surgery type (breast-conserving vs. mastectomy) (n = 74), adjuvant chemotherapy (aCT, n = 43), and adjuvant hormonal therapy (aHT, n = 39).For all decisions, both age groups most frequently preferred a shared role before consultation, except for decisions about aHT, for which younger patients more commonly preferred an active role. The proportion of patients favoring an active or passive role in each decision was lower for the older than the younger patients, but none of the differences was significant. Regarding perceived actual roles, both groups most frequently reported an active role in the surgical decision after consultation. In deciding about both aCT and aHT, a larger proportion of older patients perceived having had a passive role compared to younger patients, and a greater proportion of younger patients perceived having been active. Again, differences were not statistically significant.Most older patients preferred to decide together with their clinician, but preferences varied widely. Older patients more often than younger patients perceived they had not been involved in decisions about systemic therapy. Clinicians should invite all patients to participate in decision making and elicit their preferred role.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"http:\/\/www.clinical-breast-cancer.com\/article\/S1526820917304093\/pdf"},"label_included":1}

{"title":"Factors that shape preference for acupuncture or cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of insomnia in cancer patients","abstract":"Patient preference is an essential component of patient-centered supportive cancer care; however, little is known about the factors that shape preference for treatment. This study sought to understand what factors may contribute to patient preference for two non-pharmacological interventions, acupuncture or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).We conducted individual, open-ended, semi-structured interviews among cancer survivors who had completed active treatment and met the diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder. Two forms of codes were used for analysis: a priori set of codes derived from the key ideas and a set of codes that emerged from the data.Among 53 participants, the median age was 60.7 (range 27-83), 30 participants (56.6%) were female, and 18 (34%) were non-white. We identified three themes that contributed to an individual's treatment preference: perception of the treatment's evidence base, experience with the treatment, and consideration of personal factors. Participants gave preference to the treatment perceived as having stronger evidence. Participants also reflected on positive or negative experiences with both of the interventions, counting their own experiences, as well as those of trusted sources. Lastly, participants considered their own unique circumstances and factors such as the amount of work involved, fit with personality, or fit with their \"type\" of insomnia.Knowledge of the evidence base, past experience, and personal factors shaped patient preference regardless of whether they accurately represent the evidence. Acknowledging these salient factors may help inform patient-centered decision-making and care.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc6158018?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The Impact of Numeracy on Verbatim Knowledge of the Longitudinal Risk for Prostate Cancer Recurrence following Radiation Therapy","abstract":"Objective. Given the long natural history of prostate cancer, we assessed differing graphical formats for imparting knowledge about the longitudinal risks of prostate cancer recurrence with or without \u2018hormone\u2019 or \u2018androgen deprivation\u2019 therapy. Methods. Male volunteers without a history of prostate cancer were randomized to 1 of 8 risk communication instruments that depicted the likelihood of prostate cancer returning or spreading over 1, 2, and 3 years. The tools differed in format (line, pie, bar, or pictograph) and whether the graph also included no numbers, 1 number (indicating the number of affected individuals), or 2 numbers (indicting both the number affected and the number unaffected). The main outcome variables evaluated were graphical preference and knowledge. Results. A total of 420 men were recruited; respondents were least familiar and experienced with pictographs ( P &lt; 0.0001), and only 10% preferred this particular format. Overall accuracy ranged from 79% to 92%, and when assessed across all graphical subtypes, the addition of numerical information did not improve verbatim knowledge ( P = 0.1). Self-reported numeracy was a strong predictor of accuracy of responses (odds ratio [OR] = 2.6, P = 0.008), and the impact of high numeracy varied across graphical type, having a greater impact on line (OR = 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6\u201316; P = 0.04) and pie charts (OR = 7.1; 95% CI = 2.6\u201319; P =0.01), without an impact on pictographs (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.1\u20131.7; P = 0.17) or bar charts (OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.1\u20131.8; P = 0.24). Conclusion. For longitudinal presentation of risk, baseline numeracy was strongly prognostic for outcome. However, the addition of numbers to risk graphs improved only the delivery of verbatim knowledge for subjects with lower numeracy. Although subjects reported the least familiarity with pictographs, they were one of the most effective means of transferring information regardless of numeracy.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc4567273?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Surgical Metastasectomy in Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Systematic Review","abstract":"The benefit of surgical metastasectomy (SM) for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) remains controversial because of the lack of high-level evidence on the role of SM in terms of survival benefit in the era of systemic therapy.To perform a systematic review of the literature on the role of SM in the treatment of mRCC and discuss key issues in the SM decision-making process.A systematic search of the Embase and Medline databases was carried out and a systematic review of the role of SM in mRCC was performed. A total of 56 studies were finally included in the evidence synthesis.All the studies included were retrospective and mostly noncomparative. Median overall survival (OS) ranged from 36 to 142mo for those undergoing SM, compared to 8-27mo for no SM. SM was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to no SM (pooled adjusted hazard ratio 2.37, 95% confidence interval 2.03-2.87; p<0.001). Morbidity and mortality were similar for SM and primary tumor surgery. The most important prognostic factor for OS was complete resection of metastases. Other prognostic factors included disease free-survival from nephrectomy, primary tumor features (T stage \u22653, high grade, sarcomatoid features, and pathological nodal status), the number of metastases, and performance status. Lung metastasectomy seemed to show the best survival benefit.Although no randomized clinical data are available, published studies support the role of SM in selected patients in the modern era. Complete SM allows sustained survival free of systemic treatment. Integration of SM and systemic therapy in a multimodal approach remains a valid option for some patients.Surgical resection of metastases originating from renal cell carcinoma may play a role in prolonging survival and avoiding systemic therapy when complete resection is achievable. This strategy is an option for selected patients with a limited number of metastases who still have good general health status.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/am\/pii\/S2588931118301470"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Patients\u2019 reasoning regarding the decision to participate in clinical cancer trials: an interview study","abstract":"Clinical cancer trials are crucial for the implementation of new treatments in the clinical setting, but it is equally crucial that patients are given the opportunity to make a well-informed decision about participation. The inclusion process is complex, including both oral and written information about the trial. The process of patients' decision-making regarding clinical cancer trials has not yet been sufficiently studied. This interview study aims to explore the process of patients' reasoning regarding the decision to participate in a clinical cancer trial.The study is based on 27 individual face-to-face interviews with patients who had decided to participate in a clinical cancer trial. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim and then analysed using inductive content analysis.Content analysis revealed 17 subthemes grouped into five themes: (1) an unhesitating decision to participate; (2) a decision based on flimsy grounds and guided by emotion; (3) feeling safe and secure with my decision; (4) faced with a choice versus what choice do I have? and (5) hoping for help while helping others. The decision to participate in a clinical cancer trial was often immediate and guided by emotions, based on a trusting relationship with healthcare personnel rather than on careful reading of written information. Palliative patients, in particular, sometimes had unrealistic beliefs about the effectiveness of the trial treatment.It is vital that the decision to participate in a clinical cancer trial is preceded by an honest dialogue about possible positive and negative effects of the trial treatments, including other options such as supportive care in the palliative setting. Our findings also raise the questions of how important written information is for the decision-making process and also whether genuine informed consent is possible. To reach a higher degree of informed consent, it is most important that the oral information is given in a thorough and unbiased manner.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13063-018-2916-9"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The benefits of discussing adjuvant therapies one at a time instead of all at once","abstract":"Breast cancer patients must often decide between multiple adjuvant therapy options to prevent cancer recurrence. Standard practice, as implemented in current decision support tools, is to present information about all options simultaneously, but psychology research suggests that sequential decision processes might improve decision making. We tested whether asking women to consider hormonal therapy and chemotherapy separately would improve women's risk knowledge and\/or affect treatment intentions. We conducted an Internet-administered experimental survey of a demographically diverse sample of 1,781 women ages 40-74. Participants were randomized to experience a standard, comprehensive decision process versus sequential (one at a time) decisions regarding adjuvant therapy options for a hypothetical breast cancer patient with an estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumor. We assessed comprehension of key statistics, perceptions of treatment effectiveness, and perceived interest in adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as participants' numeracy levels. When participants made sequential decisions, they demonstrated greater comprehension of decision-relevant risk statistics, as compared to when they made decisions all at once (all P's < 0.001). Among higher-numeracy participants, those making sequential decisions were less interested in chemotherapy (P < 0.001). Lower-numeracy participants who considered all options simultaneously were insensitive to the degree of risk reduction, but those who made sequential decisions were sensitive (P = 0.03). In conclusion, presenting adjuvant therapy options sequentially improves women's comprehension of incremental treatment benefit and increases less numerate women's sensitivity to the magnitude of the achievable risk reduction over standard, all at once approaches. Sequential approaches to adjuvant therapy decisions may reduce use of chemotherapy among those at low risk for recurrence.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc3574293?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"A Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Impact of Pre-Consultation Information on Patients\u2019 Perception of Information Conveyed and Satisfaction with the Decision-Making Process","abstract":"Patient participation in treatment decision-making is a health care priority. This study hypothesized that providing a decision aid before surgical consultation would better prepare patients for decision-making. The objective was to examine the impact of a decision aid versus high-quality websites on patients' perceptions of information conveyed during surgical consultation and satisfaction with the decision process.Patients with stages 0 to 3 breast cancer were randomized. Surveys assessed perceptions of information conveyed, being asked surgical preference, and satisfaction with the decision process. Multivariable logistic regression assessed associations between outcomes and randomization arm, patient factors, and surgeon. Change in Pseudo-R2 assessed the comparative effect of these factors on perceptions of the information conveyed.The median patient age was 59 years. Most of the patients (98%) were white, and 62% were college educated (n = 201). The findings showed no association between randomization arm and perceptions of information conveyed, being asked surgical preference, or satisfaction with the decision process. Most of the patients reported discussing both breast-conserving therapy and mastectomy (69%) and being asked their surgical preference (65%). The surgeon seen was more important than the randomization arm or the patient factors in predicting patients' perceptions of information conveyed (explained 64-69% of the variation), and 63% of the patients were satisfied with the decision process.Use of a decision aid compared with high-quality websites did not increase patients' perceptions of information conveyed or satisfaction with the decision process. Although the surgeon seen influenced aspects of the patient experience, the surgeon was not associated with satisfaction. Understanding the factors driving low satisfaction is critical because this is increasingly used as a marker of health care quality.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6947662"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"What We Talk about When We Talk about Caregiving: The Distribution of Roles in Cancer Patient Caregiving in a Family-Oriented Culture","abstract":"When it comes to cancer care, the psychological well-being of family caregivers has gotten its deserved attention. However, the specific roles that the family caregivers take have not been examined as much. The current study aimed to investigate the distribution of family caregivers' roles, particularly in a family-oriented culture, Korea.A sample of 439 participants was recruited from 11 national and regional cancer centers in Korea. The participants who were 60 years old or above went through treatments for their gastric, colorectal, or lung cancer. The individual survey included questions regarding the family type, living arrangement, and the sources of support when it comes to their physical, emotional, financial, and decision-making needs.The responses from the participants showed that cancer caregiving is shared by multiple family caregivers; the major source of support for elderly cancer patients on diverse domains was their spouse; patients' reliance on their daughter(s) increased for emotional support; and patients' reliance on their son(s) stood out for financial support and decision-making support. Also, the older the patients were, the heavier their reliance was on the adult children, including sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law.Future support programs for elderly cancer patients are suggested to involve multiple family caregivers to encourage effective and efficient intervention. Also, the limitations of the current study and the suggestions for future research are discussed.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"http:\/\/www.e-crt.org\/upload\/pdf\/crt-2017-557.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial on two new dissemination strategies for a brief, shared-decision-making (SDM) training for oncologists: web-based interactive SDM online-training versus individualized context-based SDM face-to-face training","abstract":"Oncological patients often feel left out of important treatment decisions. However, when physicians engage them in shared decision-making (SDM), patients benefit in many ways and the situation is improved. SDM can effectively be taught to physicians, but participation barriers for SDM physician group trainings are high, making it hard to convince physicians to participate. With this in mind, we aim to develop and evaluate two new dissemination strategies for a brief, SDM training program based upon a proven SDM group-training concept: an individualized context-based SDM face-to-face training (IG I) and a web-based interactive SDM online training (IG II). We aim to analyze which improvements can be achieved by IG I and II compared to a control group (CG) in physician SDM competence and performance as well as the impact on the physician-patient relationship. Furthermore, we analyze differences in satisfaction concerning the two dissemination strategies by means of a training evaluation.We examine - based on a three-armed randomized controlled trial (IG I, IG II, CG) - the effectiveness of two new dissemination strategies for a SDM training program compared to a CG receiving no SDM training (voluntary access to SDM training as an incentive for participation after completion of the study). We aim to include 162 physicians randomized to one of the three arms. There will be two assessment points in time (before intervention: T0 and post-training: T1). The main outcome is the SDM competence of physicians as measured by an established observational assessment rating system (OPTION-12) by means of consultations with Standardized Patients. Standardized Patients are individuals trained to act as \"real\" patients. Secondary outcome measures are the SDM performance (SDM-Q-9) and the Questionnaire on the Quality of Physician-Patient-Interaction (QQPPI) both rated by Standardized Patients as well as the physicians' training evaluation.This trial will assess the effectiveness and acceptability of two new dissemination strategies for a brief, SDM training program for physicians.

{"title":"Patient-Reported Roles, Preferences, and Expectations Regarding Treatment of Stage I Rectal Cancer in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium","abstract":"Background Historically, stage I rectal cancer was treated with total mesorectal excision. However, there has been growing use of local excision, with and without adjuvant therapy, to treat these early rectal cancers. Little is known about how patients and providers choose among the various treatment approaches. Objective The purpose of this study was to identify patient roles, preferences, and expectations as they relate to treatment decision making for patients with stage I rectal cancer. Design This is a population-based study. Settings The study included a geographically diverse population and health-system-based cohort. Patients A total of 154 adults with newly diagnosed and surgically treated stage I rectal cancer between 2003 and 2005 were included. Main outcome measures We compared patients by surgical treatment groups, including total mesorectal excision and local excision. Clinical, sociodemographic, and health-system factors were assessed for association with patient decision-making preferences and expectations. Results A total of 80% of patients who underwent total mesorectal excision versus 63% of patients who underwent local excision expected that surgery would be curative (p = 0.04). The total mesorectal excision group was less likely to report that radiation would cure their cancer compared with the local excision group (27% vs 63%; p = 0.004). When asked about their preferred role in decision making, 28% of patients who underwent total mesorectal excision preferred patient-controlled decision making compared with 48% of patients who underwent local excision (p = 0.046). However, with regard to the treatment actually received, 38% of the total mesorectal excision group reported making their own surgical decision compared with 25% of the local excision group (p = 0.18). Limitations The study was limited by its sample size. Conclusions The preferred decision-making role for patients did not match the actual decision-making process. Future efforts should focus on bridging the gap between the decision-making process and patient preferences regarding various treatment approaches. This will be particularly important as newer innovative procedures play a more prominent role in the rectal cancer treatment paradigm.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc5015654?pdf=render"},"label_included":1}
{"title":"Why do hospital mastectomy rates vary? Differences in the decision-making experiences of women with breast cancer","abstract":"Background:Hospital mastectomy rates vary. This study explores the relationship between mastectomy rates and breast cancer patients\u2019 consultation and decision-making experiences with specialist clinicians.Methods:Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 65 patients from three purposively selected breast units from a single UK region. Patients provided with a choice of breast cancer surgery (breast conservation therapy (BCT) or mastectomy) were purposively recruited from high, medium and low case-mix-adjusted mastectomy rate units.Results:Low mastectomy rate unit patients\u2019 consultation and decision-making experiences were markedly different to those of the medium and high mastectomy rate breast units. Treatment variation was associated with patients\u2019 perception of the most reassuring and least disruptive treatment; the content and style of information provision (equipoise or directed); level of patient participation in decision making; the time and process of decision making and patient autonomy in decision making. The provision of more comprehensive less directive information and greater autonomy, time and support of independent decision making were associated with a lower uptake of BCT.Conclusion:Variation in hospital mastectomy rates was associated with differences in the consultation and decision-making experiences of breast cancer patients. Higher mastectomy rates were associated with the facilitation of more informed autonomous patient decision making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/bjc2011141.pdf"},"label_included":0}

Diagnosed men have access to a large number of information sources about therapy, including print and broadcast media, the Internet, books, and friends with the disease.Prospective survey of men with local stage prostate cancer in 3 geographically separate regions was carried out. Most men were surveyed after diagnosis but before starting therapy.On average, men with local prostate cancer consulted nearly 5 separate sources of information before treatment. The most common source of information was the patient's physician (97%), followed by lay-literature (pamphlets, videos) (76%), other health professionals (71%), friends with prostate cancer (67%), and the Internet (58%). Most men rated the sources they consulted as helpful. Consulting the Internet was associated with considering more treatment options. Several information sources were significantly associated with considering particular treatments, but the magnitude of association was small in relation to patient age, comorbidity, and Gleason score. More than 70% of men stated that they were considering or planning only one type of therapy.Men with local stage prostate cancer consult a wide range of information sources. Nonphysician information sources appear to influence their treatment considerations, but to a smaller degree than clinical factors.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc2748115?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"MGMT promoter methylation status testing to guide therapy for glioblastoma: refining the approach based on emerging evidence and current challenges","abstract":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, with a universally poor prognosis. The emergence of molecular biomarkers has had a significant impact on histological typing and diagnosis, as well as predicting patient survival and response to treatment. The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyl-transferase (MGMT) gene promoter is one such molecular biomarker. Despite the strong evidence supporting the role of MGMT methylation status in prognostication, its routine implementation in clinical practice has been challenging. The methods and optimal cutoff definitions for MGMT status determination remain controversial. Variation in detection methods between laboratories presents a major challenge for consensus. Moreover, consideration of other clinical and genetic\/epigenetic factors must also be incorporated into treatment decision making. In this review, we distill the available evidence to summarize our position on the optimal use of available assays, and propose strategies for resolving cases with equivocal methylation status and a framework for incorporating this important assay into research and clinical practice.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/neuro-oncology\/article-pdf\/21\/2\/167\/27779009\/noy132.pdf"},"label_included":0}

Family members of cancer patients and their role in end-of-life decision making","abstract":"Family members are important companions of severely ill patients with cancer. However, studies about the desirability and difficulties of integrating relatives in the decision-making process are rare in oncology. This qualitative study explores the family role in decisions to limit treatment near the end of life from the professionals' point of view.Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with oncologists (n = 12) and nurses (n = 6) working at the Department of Hematology\/Oncology at the University Hospital in Munich, Germany. The data were analyzed using a descriptive qualitative methodology and discussed from a medical ethics perspective.Four major themes played a central role in the perception of the medical staff in regard to family members. (1) Family impact on patients' treatment preferences. (2) Strong family wish for further treatment. (3) Emotional distress of the family related to the involvement in end-of-life decision-making. (4) Importance of knowing family structures.The important role of the family members in patients' disease process is recognized by oncologists and oncology nurses. However, this does not seem to lead to an early involvement of the family members.

{"title":"Participation in Clinical Research: Perspectives of Adult Patients and Parents of Pediatric Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation","abstract":"Despite major improvements over the past several decades, many patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) continue to suffer from significant treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Clinical research studies (trials) have been integral to advancing the standard of care in HSCT. However, 1 of the biggest challenges with clinical trials is the low participation rate. Although barriers to participation in cancer clinical trials have been previously explored, studies specific to HSCT are lacking. The current study was undertaken to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of HSCT patients regarding clinical trials. As members of focus groups, participants responded to open-ended questions that assessed factors influencing decision-making about HSCT clinical trials. Suggestions for improvements in the recruitment process were also solicited among participants. Seventeen adult HSCT patients and 6 parents of pediatric HSCT patients participated in the study. The median age was 56 years (range, 18 to 70) and 44 years (range, 28 to 54) for adult patients and parents, respectively. Participants universally indicated that too much information was provided within the informed consents and they were intimidated by the medical and legal language. Despite the large amount of information provided to them at the time of study enrollment, the participants had limited knowledge retention and recall of study details. Nevertheless, participants reported overall positive experiences with clinical trial participation and many would readily choose to participate again. A common concern among participants was the uncertainty of study outcome and general lack of feedback about results at the end of the study. Participants suggested that investigators provide more condensed and easier to understand informed consents and follow-up of study findings. These findings could be used to help guide the development of improved consent documents and enhanced participation in research studies, thereby affecting the future design of HSCT research protocols.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"http:\/\/www.bbmt.org\/article\/S108387911400370X\/pdf"},"label_included":0}

Public awareness of rhBMP-2 and its complications has not been assessed. The authors studied published news media articles to analyze information provided to the public on this bone graft substitute.We utilized the academic database, LexisNexis, to locate newspaper articles published between January 2001 and July 2013. All articles were coded by a coder and reviewed by the principal investigator.The search identified 87 national and 99 local newspaper articles. Complications mentioned in national newspapers included cancer (24%), retrograde ejaculation (24%), and abnormal bone growth (14%). Local newspapers cited cancer (14%), inflammation (14%), and retrograde ejaculation (9.2%) most frequently. Fifty national (59%) and 35 local (54%) articles had no mention of complications. Sources of evidence cited by articles were (in order of frequency): Governmental agencies, medical research or published studies, healthcare personnel or patients, and companies or corporations.Only a small percentage of newspaper articles presented potential complications. Despite lack of clear scientific causal relationship between rhBMP-2 and cancer, this risk was disproportionately reported. Additionally, many did not cite scientific sources. Lack of reliable information available to the public reiterates the role of physicians in discussing risks and benefits BMP use in spinal surgery, assuring that patients are making informed decisions.

{"title":"Responsible Prescribing of Opioids for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain: A Scoping Review","abstract":"Chronic non-cancer pain is common and long-term opioid therapy is frequently used in its management. While opioids can be effective, they are also associated with significant harm and misuse, and clinicians must weigh any expected benefits with potential risks when making decisions around prescribing. This review aimed to summarise controlled trials and systematic reviews that evaluate patient-related, provider-related, and system-related factors supporting responsible opioid prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain. A scoping review methodology was employed, and six databases were searched. Thirteen systematic reviews and nine controlled trials were included for analysis, and clinical guidelines were reviewed to supplement gaps in the literature. The majority of included studies evaluated provider-related factors, including prescribing behaviours and monitoring for misuse. A smaller number of studies evaluated system-level factors such as regulatory measures and models of healthcare delivery. Studies and guidelines emphasise the importance of careful patient selection for opioid therapy, development of a treatment plan, and cautious initiation and dose escalation. Lower doses are associated with reduced risk of harm and can be efficacious, particularly when used in the context of a multimodal interdisciplinary pain management program. Further research is needed around many elements of responsible prescribing, including instruments to monitor for misuse, and the role of policies and programs.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2226-4787\/8\/3\/150\/pdf?version=1597929813"},"label_included":0}

To support these women in the decision-making process, a structured decision support consisting of decision coaching combined with a decision aid might be helpful. Methods\/design A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in order to compare usual care with structured decision support alongside usual care. The decision support program entails nurse-led decision coaching as well as an evidence-based patient decision aid. Nurses are qualified by a 4-day training program in informed decision-making and decision coaching. Six centers for Familial Breast and Ovarian Cancer in Germany will be included in the study, with a planned sample size of 398 women. The primary outcome is the congruence between the preferred and the actual played role in the decision-making process as measured by the Control Preferences Scale. It is hypothesized that the structured decision support will enable women to play the preferred role in the decision-making process. Secondary outcomes include the knowledge and attitudes about preventive options, decisional conflict, depression and anxiety, coping self-efficacy, impact of event, and self-concept.

{"title":"Meeting the Decision-Making Preferences of Patients With Breast Cancer in Oncology Consultations: Impact on Decision-Related Outcomes","abstract":"Purpose To investigate how involvement preferences of patients with breast cancer change during the treatment decision-making process and determine the impact of meeting patients' expectations on decision-making outcomes. Patients and Methods Participants were 683 patients with breast cancer from 62 oncologists in five different countries recruited to an International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG 33-03) project. Questionnaires elicited patients' pre- and postconsultation preferences for involvement in treatment decision making and whether these were met or not. Decision-related outcomes were assessed postconsultation. Results Before the consultation, most patients preferred shared or patient-directed treatment decision making. After the consultation, 43% of patients' preferences changed, and most shifted toward patient-directed decisions. The actual postconsultation decision was more likely to be made according to postconsultation rather than preconsultation preferences. Compared with patients who were less involved than they had hoped to be, patients who were as involved as they had hoped to be or were even more involved in decision making had significantly better decision-related outcomes. This was true regardless of whether preference change occurred. Conclusion Many patients with early-stage breast cancer have treatment options and approach treatment decisions with a desire for decisional control, which may increase after their consultation. Patients' ultimate involvement preferences were more likely to be consistent with the way the decision was actually made, suggesting that patients need to feel concordance between their preference and the actual decision. Patients who directed decisions, even if more than they hoped for, fared better on all decision-related outcomes. These results emphasize the need for oncologists to endorse and facilitate patient participation in treatment decision making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/ascopubs.org\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1200\/JCO.2011.37.7952?role=tab"},"label_included":1}
{"title":"Effect of deformable registration uncertainty on lung SBRT dose accumulation","abstract":"Deformable image registration (DIR) plays an important role in dose accumulation, such as incorporating breathing motion into the accumulation of the delivered dose based on daily 4DCBCT images. However, it is not yet well understood how the uncertainties associated with DIR methods affect the dose calculations and resulting clinical metrics. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of DIR uncertainty on the clinical metrics derived from its use in dose accumulation.A biomechanical model based DIR method and a biomechanical-intensity-based hybrid method, which reduced the average registration error by 1.6 mm, were applied to ten lung cancer patients. A clinically relevant dose parameter [minimum dose to 0.5 cm(3) (Dmin)] was calculated for three dose scenarios using both algorithms. Dose scenarios included static (no breathing motion), predicted (breathing motion at the time of planning), and total accumulated (interfraction breathing motion). The relationship between the dose parameter and a combination of DIR uncertainty metrics, tumor volume, and dose heterogeneity of the plan was investigated.Depending on the dose heterogeneity, tumor volume, and DIR uncertainty, in over 50% of the patients, differences greater than 1.0 Gy were observed in the Dmin of the tumor in the static dose calculation on exhale phase of the 4DCT. Such differences were due to the errors in propagating the tumor contours from the reference planning 4DCT phase onto a subsequent 4DCT phase using each DIR algorithm and calculating the dose on that phase. The differences in predicted dose were more subtle when breathing motion was modeled explicitly at the time of planning with only one patient exhibiting a greater than 1.0 Gy difference in Dmin. Dmin differences of up to 2.5 Gy were found in the total accumulated delivered dose due to difference in quantifying the interfraction variations. Such dose uncertainties could potentially be clinically significant.Reductions in average uncertainty in DIR algorithms by 1.6 mm may have a clinically significant impact on the decision-making metrics used in dose planning and dose accumulation assessment.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc4691248?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"How Do Women Interpret the NHS Information Leaflet about Cervical Cancer Screening?","abstract":"Background. Organized screening programs often rely on written materials to inform the public. In the United Kingdom, women invited for cervical cancer screening receive a leaflet from the National Health Service (NHS) to support screening decisions. However, information about screening may be too complex for people to understand, potentially hindering informed decision making. Objectives. We aimed to identify women\u2019s difficulties in interpreting the leaflet used in England and negative and positive responses to the leaflet. Methods. We used a sequential mixed-methods design involving 2 steps: cognitive think-aloud interviews ( n = 20), followed by an England-wide survey ( n = 602). Data were collected between June 2017 and December 2018, and participants included women aged 25 to 64 y with varying sociodemographics. Results. Interview results revealed misunderstandings concerning screening results, benefits, and additional tests and treatment, although participants tended to react positively to numerical information. Participants were often unfamiliar with the potential harms associated with screening (i.e., screening risks), key aspects of human papillomavirus, and complex terms (e.g., dyskaryosis). Survey results indicated that interpretation difficulties were common ( M correct items = 12.5 of 23). Lower understanding was associated with lower educational level (\u03b2\u2019s &gt;0.15, P\u2019s &lt;0.001), lower numeracy scores (\u03b2 = 0.36, P &lt; 0.001), and nonwhite ethnicity (\u03b2 = 0.10, P = 0.007). The leaflet was evaluated positively overall. Conclusions. Despite previous user testing of the leaflet, key information may be too complex for some recipients. As a consequence, they may struggle to make informed decisions about screening participation based on the information provided. We discuss implications for the improvement of communications about screening and decision support.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1177\/0272989X19873647"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The role of specialized hospital units in infection and mortality risk reduction among patients with hematological cancers","abstract":"Patients with hematological malignancies are susceptible to life-threatening infections after chemotherapy. The current study aimed to evaluate whether management of such patients in dedicated inpatient and emergency wards could provide superior infection prevention and outcome.We have developed an approach allowing to retrieve infection-related information from unstructured electronic medical records of a tertiary center. Data on 2,330 adults receiving 13,529 chemotherapy treatments for hematological malignancies were identified and assessed. Infection and mortality hazard rates were calculated with multivariate models. Patients were randomly divided into 80:20 training and validation cohorts. To develop patient-tailored risk-prediction models, several machine-learning methods were compared using area under the curve (AUC).Of the tested algorithms, the probit model was found to most accurately predict the evaluated hazards and was implemented in an online calculator. The infection-prediction model identified risk factors for infection based on patient characteristics, treatment and history. Observation of patients with a high predicted infection risk in general wards appeared to increase their infection hazard (p = 0.009) compared to similar patients observed in hematology units. The mortality-risk model demonstrated that for infection events starting at home, admission through hematology services was associated with a lower mortality hazard compared to admission through the general emergency department (p = 0.007). Both models show that dedicated hematological facilities and emergency services improve patient outcome post-chemotherapy. The calculated numbers needed to treat were 30.27 and 31.08 for the dedicated emergency and observation facilities, respectively. Infection hazard risks were found to be non-monotonic in time.The accuracy of the proposed mortality and infection risk-prediction models was high, with the AUC of 0.74 and 0.83, respectively. Our results demonstrate that temporal assessment of patient risks is feasible. This may enable physicians to move from one-point decision-making to a continuous dynamic observation, allowing a more flexible and patient-tailored admission policy.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0211694&type=printable"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Application of the rapid ethical assessment approach to enhance the ethical conduct of longitudinal population based female cancer research in an urban setting in Ethiopia","abstract":"Rapid Ethical Assessment (REA) is an approach used to design context tailored consent process for voluntary participation of participants in research including human subjects. There is, however, limited evidence on the design of ethical assessment in studies targeting cancer patients in Ethiopia. REA was conducted to explore factors that influence the informed consent process among female cancer patients recruited for longitudinal research from Addis Ababa Population-based Cancer Registry.Qualitative study employing rapid ethnographic approach was conducted from May-July, 2017, at the Tikur Anbessa Specialized Referral Hospital. In-depth and key informants' interviews were conducted among purposively selected 16 participants. Regular de-briefings among the study team helped to identify emerging themes and ensure saturation. Interviews and debriefings were tape recorded in Amharic, and transcribed and translated to English. Coding of the transcripts was facilitated by use of NVivo software. Thematic analysis was employed to respond to the initial questions and interpret findings.Perceived barriers to voluntary study participation included lack of reporting back study results of previous studies, the decision making status of women, hopelessness or fatigue in the patients, shyness of the women, data collectors approach to the patient, and patient's time constraints. Most of the patients preferred oral over written consent and face-to-face interview over telephone interview. Provision of detail information about the study, using short and understandable tool, competent, compassionate and respectful enumerators of the same gender were suggested to assure participation. Due to the perceived severity, the use of the term \"cancer\" was associated with fear and anxiety. Alternatively, uses of phrases like \"breast or cervical illness\/disease\" were suggested during patient interviews.Voluntary participation is not straight forward but affected by different factors. Using competent, compassionate and respectful enumerators, short and precise questioning tools to limit the time of the interview could improve voluntary participation. Moreover, careful consideration of the patients and families concept of the disease such as wording and information has to be taken into account. This assessment helped in improving the consent process of the ongoing project on breast and cervical cancer patients.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12910-018-0328-8"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Circulating Tumor Cells as Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer","abstract":"Abstract Unmet needs in prostate cancer drug development and patient management are the ability to monitor treatment effects and to identify therapeutic targets in a tumor at the time treatment is being considered. This review focuses on establishing analytically valid biomarkers for specific contexts of use in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), emphasizing a biomarker currently in clinical use, circulating tumor cells (CTC). The FDA Critical Path provides a road map for these investigations, which, if followed, will facilitate the incorporation of these types of assays into clinical decision-making. CTC enumeration at baseline and post-treatment is prognostic of survival, with no threshold effect, and the shedding of cells into the circulation represents an intrinsic property of the tumor, distinct from extent of disease. The clinical utility of monitoring CTC changes with treatment, as an efficacy-response surrogate biomarker of survival, is currently being tested in large phase III trials, with the novel antiandrogen therapies abiraterone acetate and MDV3100. Molecular determinants can be identified and characterized in CTCs as potential predictive biomarkers of tumor sensitivity to a therapeutic modality. Additionally, we discuss novel technologies to enrich and characterize CTCs from more patients, the potential clinical uses of CTCs in determining prognosis and monitoring treatment effects, and CTCs as a source of tissue to identify predictive markers of drug sensitivity to guide treatment selection. Prospective studies, designed around the biomarker itself and the specific clinical context for which it is applied, are needed to further assess the role of these and novel markers in clinical practice.

As the choice between available reproductive options is preference-sensitive, the use of a decision aid can support these couples in their decisional process. The present study aims to investigate preferences and needs of involved stakeholders regarding the development and implementation of a patient decision aid. Semi-structured interviews assessing the needs and preferences regarding the content and functionalities of a decision support program were conducted among seven couples at risk for hereditary cancer and among eight clinical geneticists involved in oncogenetic counseling. Many similarities were found between the expressed preferences and needs of both stakeholder groups concerning the content, barriers and facilitating factors regarding the use of the decision aid, and its implementation. Emphasis was placed on the use of simple non-medical language, an extensive explanation of the procedures and techniques used in prenatal diagnosis (PND) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and the role of health care providers to refer couples to the decision aid. Both stakeholder groups were in favor of incorporating narrative stories in the decision aid.

{"title":"Developing and Validating Risk Assessment Models of Clinical Outcomes in Modern Oncology","abstract":"The identification of prognostic factors and building of risk assessment prognostic models will continue to play a major role in 21st century medicine in patient management and decision making. Investigators often are interested in examining the relationship among host, tumor-related, and environmental variables in predicting clinical outcomes. We distinguish between static and dynamic prediction models. In static prediction modeling, variables collected at baseline typically are used in building models. On the other hand, dynamic predictive models leverage the longitudinal data of covariates collected during treatment or follow-up and hence provide accurate predictions of patients\u2019 prognoses. To date, most risk assessment models in oncology have been based on static models. In this article, we cover topics related to the analysis of prognostic factors, centering on factors that are both relevant at the time of diagnosis or initial treatment and during treatment. We describe the types of risk prediction and then provide a brief description of the penalized regression methods. We then review the state-of-the art methods for dynamic prediction and compare the strengths and limitations of these methods. Although static models will continue to play an important role in oncology, developing and validating dynamic models of clinical outcomes need to take a higher priority. A framework for developing and validating dynamic tools in oncology seems to still be needed. One of the limitations in oncology that may constrain modelers is the lack of access to longitudinal biomarker data. It is highly recommended that the next generation of risk assessments consider longitudinal biomarker data and outcomes so that prediction can be continually updated.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/ascopubs.org\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1200\/PO.19.00068"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Podoplanin associates with adverse postoperative prognosis of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma","abstract":"Podoplanin, a transmembrane sialomucin-like glycoprotein, was recently shown to be involved in tumor progression and metastasis, and its potential role in facilitating platelet-based tumor embolization and promigratory phenotype of cancer cells was also demonstrated. In this study, we assessed the clinical significance of tumoral podoplanin expression in 295 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) through immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays and analyzing the staining intensity. Univariate analysis suggested an adverse prognostic effect of high tumoral podoplanin expression on patients' overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P < 0.001 for both). In the multivariate analysis, high tumoral podoplanin expression (using staining intensity as either a continuous or dichotomous variable) was still an independent adverse prognostic factor for patient survival (OS, P < 0.001, RFS, P < 0.001 for continuous; OS, P < 0.001, RFS, P = 0.002 for dichotomous). Moreover, stratified analysis identified a higher prognostic power in the intermediate\/high risk patient groups. After utilizing those parameters in the validated multivariate analysis, two nomograms were constructed to predict ccRCC patients' OS and RFS (c-index 0.815 and 0.805, respectively), and performed better than existing integrated models (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). In conclusion, high tumoral podoplanin expression could independently predict an adverse clinical outcome for ccRCC patients, and it might be useful in future for clinical decision-making and therapeutic developments.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1111\/cas.13007"},"label_included":0}

The Control Preference Scale (CPS) was administered to patients and physicians, and the Krantz Health Opinion Survey (KHOS) was completed by the patients alone. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between sociodemographic characteristics, the patients' involvement in treatment decision-making, and patients' preference for behavioral involvement and information related to their disease.The majority of patients preferred to share decision-making with their physicians (47.5%), while the second largest group preferred being passive (42.6%) and a small number preferred being active (9.8%). However, the physicians perceived that the majority of patients preferred active decision-making (56.9%), followed by those who desired shared decision-making (32.8%), and those who preferred passive decision-making (10.3%). The overall concordance was 26.5% (54 of 204 patient-physician dyads). The median of preference for information score and behavioral involvement score was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] =3-5) and 2 (IQR =2-3), respectively. In univariate analysis, the ethnicity and educational qualification of patients were significantly associated with the patients' preferred role in the process of treatment decision-making and the patients' preference for information seeking (p>0.05). However, only educational qualification (p=0.004) was significantly associated with patients' preference for information seeking in multivariate analysis.Physicians failed to understand patients' perspectives and preferences in treatment decision-making. The concordance between physicians' perception and patients' perception was quite low as the physicians perceived that more than half of the patients were active in treatment decision-making.

{"title":"Report of chronic myeloid leukemia SMS Medical College Hospital, Jaipur","abstract":"Abstract This is a retrospective analysis of patients of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) registered and under treatment at the Leukemia Lymphoma Clinic at the Birla Cancer Center, SMS Medical College Hospital, Jaipur. Approximately, two-thirds of the patients are getting imatinib mesylate (IM) through the Glivec International Patient Assistance Program while the rest are on generic IM. In addition to comparison of hematological and molecular responses in the Glivec versus the genetic group, in this analysis, an attempt is also made to assess the socio-economic (SE) status of the patients and its effect on the response rates. Of the 213 patients studied, most (28.6%) are in the age group between 30 years and 40 years and the mean age of the patients in 39 years, a good decade younger that in the west. There is a suggestion that patients in lower SE class present with higher Sokal scores and with more disease burden. Possibly hematological responses are similar with both Glivec and generic IM. No comment can be made with regards to molecular response between the two groups as a significant number of patients in the Glivec arm (42%) do not have molecular assessment because of economic reasons. CML is a common and challenging disease in the developing world with patients presenting at an earlier age with more advanced disease. SE factors play a significant role in therapy and disease monitoring decision making and may impact on response rates and prognosis.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4103\/0971-5851.123723"},"label_included":0}

The literature remains inconclusive on the HTA decision-making factors that influence the utilization of MEAs. We aimed to assess if the uptake of MEAs differs between countries and if so, to understand which HTA decision-making criteria play a role in determining such differences. Methods All oncology medicines approved since 2009 in Australia, England, Scotland, and Sweden were studied. Four categories of variables were collected from publicly available HTA reports of the above drugs: (i) Social Value Judgments (SVJs), (ii) Clinical\/Economic evidence submitted, (iii) Interpretation of this evidence, and (iv) Funding decision. Conditional\/restricted decisions were coded as Listed With Conditions (LWC) other than an MEA or LWC including an MEA (LWCMEA). Cohen's \u03ba -scores measured the inter-rater agreement of countries on their LWCMEA outcomes and Pearson's chi-squared tests explored the association between HTA variables and LWCMEA outcomes. Results A total of 74 drug-indication pairs were found resulting in n = 296 observations; 8 percent ( n = 23) were LWC and 55 percent ( n = 163) were LWCMEA. A poor-to-moderate agreement existed between countries (\u2212.29 &lt; \u03ba &lt; .33) on LWCMEA decisions. Cross-country differences within the LWCMEA sample were partly driven by economic uncertainties and largely driven by SVJs considered across agencies.

We assessed the effects of postmastectomy radiotherapy on quality of life (QOL) in women with intermediate-risk breast cancer.SUPREMO is an open-label, international, parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial. Women aged 18 years or older with intermediate-risk breast cancer (defined as pT1-2N1; pT3N0; or pT2N0 if also grade III or with lymphovascular invasion) who had undergone mastectomy and, if node positive, axillary surgery, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chest wall radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions or a radiobiologically equivalent dose of 45 Gy in 20 fractions or 40 Gy in 15 fractions) or no radiotherapy. Randomisation was done with permuted blocks of varying block length, and stratified by centre, without masking of patients or investigators. The primary endpoint is 10-year overall survival.

This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN61145589.Between Aug 4, 2006, and April 29, 2013, 1688 patients were enrolled internationally and randomly assigned to receive chest wall radiotherapy (n=853) or not (n=835). 989 (79%) of 1258 patients from 111 UK centres consented to participate in the QOL substudy (487 in the radiotherapy group and 502 in the no radiotherapy group), of whom 947 (96%) returned the baseline questionnaires and were included in the analysis (radiotherapy, n=471; no radiotherapy, n=476). At up to 2 years, chest wall symptoms were worse in the radiotherapy group than in the no radiotherapy group (mean score 14\u00b71 [SD 15\u00b78] in the radiotherapy group vs 11\u00b76 [14\u00b76] in the no radiotherapy group; effect estimate 2\u00b717, 95% CI 0\u00b740-3\u00b794; p=0\u00b7016); however, there was an improvement in both groups between years 1 and 2 (visit effect -1\u00b734, 95% CI -2\u00b736 to -0\u00b731; p=0\u00b7010). No differences were seen between treatment groups in arm and shoulder symptoms, body image, fatigue, overall QOL, physical function, or anxiety or depression scores.Postmastectomy radiotherapy led to more local (chest wall) symptoms up to 2 years postrandomisation compared with no radiotherapy, but the difference between groups was small.

{"title":"Evidenced\u2010based practice of decision\u2010making process in oncofertility care among registered nurses: A qualitative study","abstract":"Aim The purpose of our study was to construct the context of the nursing action\/role in oncofertility care. Design Qualitative research. Methods We applied grounded theory to guide the qualitative study. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 12 nurses in Taipei. The data were collected from August 2018 to February 2019. Results The core theme that described the role of nurses' decision-making in oncofertility care focused on understanding oncofertility from the self to the other. Care roles or actions in oncofertility that involved the process of psychological cognition were divided into four dimensions: perceiving the patient's changes and needs, triggering the self's emotions, empathizing with patient's situations and introspective care roles. Nurses who had experienced the phase of empathizing with the patient's situations developed more diverse roles and had positive actions toward oncofertility care. Based on the psychological changes for oncofertility decision-making process, implementing contextual training in oncofertility could help nurses create more positive actions in oncofertility care.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/nop2.684"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Exploring Cancer Treatment Decision-Making by Patients: A Descriptive Study","abstract":"Objective: Using an interview-guided survey, our descriptive study aimed to document the extent to which cancer patients perceive they are involved in making treatment decisions and the factors that influence patient involvement. Patients and methods: Our study enrolled patients from a Canadian ambulatory oncology program who were undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both, for cancer. The adapted Control Preferences Scale was used to survey perceived and preferred roles in decision-making. The study survey also included items from the Decisional Conflict Scale and the Preparation for Decision-Making Scale. Results: Of 192 participants, 98 (51%) perceived that they were offered treatment choices. Of those 98, 47 (48%) thought that the options were presented equally. Compared with the patients not offered choices, those who were given choices were less passive (4% vs. 29%, p &lt; 0.001) and more satisfied (100% vs. 95%, p &lt; 0.03) in decision-making. Participants whose preferred and perceived roles were different would have preferred more involvement in decision-making. To attain the preferred involvement, patients wanted to receive more information on treatment options, to be given a choice, to have more discussion with the health care team, and to have providers better listen to their needs. Conclusions: Only half of surveyed patients thought that they were offered choices for their cancer treatment. When offered choices, patients were more active in decision-making. Further initiatives are required to determine approaches for supporting patients with cancer so that they can be more involved in decision-making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1718-7729\/17\/4\/527\/pdf"},"label_included":1}
{"title":"iManageMyHealth and iSupportMyPatients: mobile decision support and health management apps for cancer patients and their doctors","abstract":"Clinical decision support systems can play a crucial role in healthcare delivery as they promise to improve health outcomes and patient safety, reduce medical errors and costs and contribute to patient satisfaction. Used in an optimal way, they increase the quality of healthcare by proposing the right information and intervention to the right person at the right time in the healthcare delivery process. This paper reports on a specific approach to integrated clinical decision support and patient guidance in the cancer domain as proposed by the H2020 iManageCancer project. This project aims at facilitating efficient self-management and management of cancer according to the latest available clinical knowledge and the local healthcare delivery model, supporting patients and their healthcare providers in making informed decisions on treatment choices and in managing the side effects of their therapy. The iManageCancer platform is a comprehensive platform of interconnected mobile tools to empower cancer patients and to support them in the management of their disease in collaboration with their doctors. The backbone of the iManageCancer platform comprises a personal health record and the central decision support unit (CDSU). The latter offers dedicated services to the end users in combination with the apps iManageMyHealth and iSupportMyPatients. The CDSU itself is composed of the so-called Care Flow Engine (CFE) and the model repository framework (MRF). The CFE executes personalised and workflow oriented formal disease management diagrams (Care Flows). In decision points of such a Care Flow, rules that operate on actual health information of the patient decide on the treatment path that the system follows. Alternatively, the system can also invoke a predictive model of the MRF to proceed with the best treatment path in the diagram. Care Flow diagrams are designed by clinical experts with a specific graphical tool that also deploys these diagrams as executable workflows in the CFE following the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. They are exposed as services that patients or their doctors can use in their apps in order to manage certain aspects of the cancer disease like pain, fatigue or the monitoring of chemotherapies at home. The mHealth platform for cancer patients is currently being assessed in clinical pilots in Italy and Germany and in several end-user workshops.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/ecancer.org\/en\/journal\/article\/848-imanagemyhealth-and-isupportmypatients-mobile-decision-support-and-health-management-apps-for-cancer-patients-and-their-doctors\/pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Expectations and perspectives of ovarian cancer patients about cancer management in Romania. The international NOGGO-ENGOT trial: EXPRESSION III","abstract":"We have investigated a relational model of expectations and preferences among ovarian cancer patients centred on physician-patient communication, treatment approach, and the need for information. Consecutive patients anonymously filled in the EXPRESSION III questionnaire between 2009 and 2012. Following descriptive statistics, structural equation modelling was used to analyse the relationships between physician's evaluation by the patient (PEP), result of therapy (RT), need for changes in treatment (NCT) and patient's desire to be informed (PD). From a total of 108 patients, 53 (49.1%) knew their disease stage, 103 (95.4%) underwent surgery, 91 (84.3%) had chemotherapy and 51 (46.3%) relapsed. The final model demonstrated a good fit of data with fit indices >0.90. There was a significant positive effect of PEP on RT and a significant negative effect of PEP on NCT, with the final model explaining 84% of the NCT variance. Physicians represent the main point of contact, not only as a source of information about the disease and various treatment options, but also in the coping processes. As patients benefit from completeness of medical consultations, their awareness of the treatment outcome increases, while a negative perception of the physician leads to a desire to make changes in therapy.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/ecc.12566"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"State-of-the-art imaging for diagnosis of metastatic bone disease","abstract":"Metastatic bone disease (MBD) is common-it is detected in up to 65-75% of patients with breast or prostate cancer, in over 35% of patients with lung cancer; and almost all patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma have focal lesions or a diffuse bone marrow infiltration. Metastatic bone disease can cause a variety of symptoms and is often associated with a poorer prognosis, with high social and health-care costs. Population-based cohort studies confirm significantly increased health-care utilization costs in patients presenting with cancer with MBD compared with those without MBD. The prolonged survival of patients with bone metastasis thanks to advances in therapy presents an opportunity for better treatments for this patient cohort. Early and accurate diagnosis of bone metastases is therefore crucial. The patterns and presentation of MBD are quite heterogeneous and necessitate good knowledge of the possibilities and limitations of each imaging modality. Here, we review the state-of-the-art imaging techniques, assess the need for evidence-based and cost-effective patient care pathways, and advocate multidisciplinary management based on collaborations between orthopedic surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiotherapists, and radiologists aimed at improving patient outcomes. Radiologists play a key role in this multidisciplinary approach to decision-making through correlating the tumor entity, the tumor biology, the impact on the surrounding tissues and progression, as well as the overall condition of the patient. This approach helps to choose the best patient-tailored imaging plan advocating a \"choose wisely\" strategy throughout the initial diagnosis, minimally invasive treatment procedures, as well as follow-up care plans.Eine Knochenmetastasierung ist h\u00e4ufig \u2013 bei bis zu 65\u201375 % der Patienten mit Brust- oder Prostatakrebs, bei \u00fcber 35 % der Patienten mit Lungenkrebs; und fast alle Patienten mit symptomatischem multiplem Myelom weisen fokale L\u00e4sionen oder eine diffuse Knochenmarkinfiltration auf. Knochenmetastasierung kann eine Vielzahl von Symptomen hervorrufen und ist h\u00e4ufig mit einer schlechteren Prognose sowie hohen sozialen und medizinischen Kosten verbunden. Bev\u00f6lkerungsbasierte Kohortenstudien best\u00e4tigen einen signifikanten Anstieg der Kosten f\u00fcr die Inanspruchnahme der Gesundheitsversorgung bei Patienten mit Knochenmetastasierung im Vergleich zu Patienten ohne oss\u00e4re Metastasen. Ein l\u00e4ngeres \u00dcberleben von Patienten mit Knochenmetastasen aufgrund von Fortschritten in der Therapie bietet die M\u00f6glichkeit, diese Patienten besser zu behandeln. Eine fr\u00fchzeitige und genaue Diagnose von Knochenmetastasen ist daher von entscheidender Bedeutung.

{"title":"Advance Care Planning in Glioblastoma Patients","abstract":"Despite multimodal treatment with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma is an incurable disease with a poor prognosis. During the disease course, glioblastoma patients may experience progressive neurological deficits, symptoms of increased intracranial pressure such as drowsiness and headache, incontinence, seizures and progressive cognitive dysfunction. These patients not only have cancer, but also a progressive brain disease. This may seriously interfere with their ability to make their own decisions regarding treatment. It is therefore warranted to involve glioblastoma patients early in the disease trajectory in treatment decision-making on their future care, including the end of life (EOL) care, which can be achieved with Advance Care Planning (ACP). Although ACP, by definition, aims at timely involvement of patients and proxies in decision-making on future care, the optimal moment to initiate ACP discussions in the disease trajectory of glioblastoma patients remains controversial. Moreover, the disease-specific content of these ACP discussions needs to be established. In this article, we will first describe the history of patient participation in treatment decision-making, including the shift towards ACP. Secondly, we will describe the possible role of ACP for glioblastoma patients, with the specific aim of treatment of disease-specific symptoms such as somnolence and dysphagia, epileptic seizures, headache, and personality changes, agitation and delirium in the EOL phase, and the importance of timing of ACP discussions in this patient population.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6694\/8\/11\/102\/pdf?version=1478603636"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Predictors of Treatment Decisions in Multidisciplinary Oncology Meetings: A Quantitative Observational Study","abstract":"In many healthcare systems, treatment recommendations for cancer patients are formulated by multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs). Evidence suggests that interdisciplinary contributions to case reviews in the meetings are unequal and information-sharing suboptimal, with biomedical information dominating over information on patient comorbidities and psychosocial factors. This study aimed to evaluate how different elements of the decision process affect the teams' ability to reach a decision on first case review.This was an observational quantitative assessment of 1045 case reviews from 2010 to 2014 in cancer MTBs using a validated tool, the Metric for the Observation of Decision-making. This tool allows evaluation of the quality of information presentation (case history, radiological, pathological, and psychosocial information, comorbidities, and patient views), and contribution to discussion by individual core specialties (surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, and specialist cancer nurses). The teams' ability to reach a decision was a dichotomous outcome variable (yes\/no).Using multiple logistic regression analysis, the significant positive predictors of the teams' ability to reach a decision were patient psychosocial information (odds ratio [OR] 1.35) and the inputs of surgeons (OR 1.62), radiologists (OR 1.48), pathologists (OR 1.23), and oncologists (OR 1.13). The significant negative predictors were patient comorbidity information (OR 0.83) and nursing inputs (OR 0.87).Multidisciplinary inputs into case reviews and patient psychosocial information stimulate decision making, thereby reinforcing the role of MTBs in cancer care in processing such information. Information on patients' comorbidities, as well as nursing inputs, make decision making harder, possibly indicating that a case is complex and requires more detailed review. Research should further define case complexity and determine ways to better integrate patient psychosocial information into decision making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/kclpure.kcl.ac.uk\/portal\/files\/88525887\/Predictors_of_treatment_decisions_SOUKUP_Publishedonline5July2016_GREEN_AAM.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Discordance Between Advanced Cancer Patients\u2019 Perceived and Preferred Roles in Decision Making and its Association with Psychological Distress and Perceived Quality of Care","abstract":"We investigated patient-reported roles of families, physicians, and patients themselves in treatment decision making and whether discordance between perceived and preferred roles is associated with psychological distress and perceived quality of care among patients with cancer.We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from 599 adults with stage IV solid malignancy in Singapore. Stuart-Maxwell tests were used to compare patients' perceived and preferred roles in decision making. Types of discordance were categorized as follows: involvement at a lesser level than preferred, involvement at a greater level than preferred, and no change in patient involvement. Ordinary least squares regressions examined the associations between types of discordance and patient outcomes, controlling for patient characteristics.Discordance between perceived and preferred roles was observed in 16% of patients. Amongst patients with discordance, 33% reported being involved at a lesser level than they preferred, 47% reported being involved at a greater level than they preferred, and 19% reported discordance where level of patient involvement did not change. Multivariable analyses showed that lesser involvement than preferred and discordance with no change in patient involvement were associated with poorer quality of physician communication (\u03b2 = - 9.478 [95% confidence interval {CI} - 16.303 to - 2.653] and \u03b2 = - 9.184 [95% CI - 18.066 to - 0.301]) and poorer care coordination (\u03b2 = - 11.658 [95% CI - 17.718 to - 5.597] and \u03b2 = - 8.856 [95% CI - 16.744 to - 0.968]) compared with concordance.Most patients reported participating at their desired level. Despite this finding, our results suggest that involving patients at a lesser level than they prefer can lead to poorer perceived quality of physician communication and care coordination and that encouraging patient participation is a safe approach to minimizing poor outcomes.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/kclpure.kcl.ac.uk\/portal\/files\/160178553\/Discordance_between_advanced_cancer_OZDEMIR_Publishedonline11February2021_GREEN_AAM.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Shared Decision Making in Breast Cancer: Womens' Attitudes","abstract":"The patient autonomy and the greater role for women with breast cancer in the decisions about their health are recent issues in healthcare. The objective of this work is to identify and characterize the elements that influence them in treatment decisions.A phenomenological type qualitative study. Theoretical Sampling included 70 women diagnosed with breast cancer. 45 semi structured interviews and 3 focus groups were performed between October 2009 and July 2010 in 15 regions of Spain. The analysis was based on the principles of grounded theory with the support of Atlas.ti v6.1.Patients are likely to take an active or passive role regarding decision-making depending on different variables such as their age, the information available, their self-assessment as capable agents to make decisions and the relative importance given to physical appearance. As the disease progresses, it can cause a change in women attitude, from an initially passive attitude to a more active role. The attitude of health professionals concerning shared decision-making and the information they offer determines patient participation while the family plays an essential role as a support or reinforcement of decisions made by patients.The patients' attitude regarding the decision-making of patients is very variable, becoming increasingly important the emotional status, the level of information available and the influence of the context.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/scielo.isciii.es\/pdf\/resp\/v87n1\/07_original5.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Reimbursement of Drugs for Rare Diseases through the Public Healthcare System in Canada: Where Are We Now?","abstract":"Over the past 20 years, the number of therapies developed for rare diseases has rapidly increased. Often, these therapies represent the only active treatment for debilitating and\/or life-threatening conditions. However, they create significant challenges for public and private payers. Because they target small patient populations, clinical evidence of efficacy\/effectiveness is typically limited, while the cost per patient is high. In Canada, each province\/territory establishes its own mechanisms for determining which drugs for rare diseases (DRDs) to provide.To compare current mechanisms across provinces and territories, and explore their impact on access.A systematic review of relevant published and unpublished documents was performed. Electronic bibliographic databases, the internet, and government websites were scanned using structured search strategies. Information was extracted independently by two researchers, and included aspects such as program type, condition\/patient\/therapy eligibility criteria, role of health technology assessment (HTA), decision options, ethical assumptions, and stakeholder input. It was validated through member-checking with provincial\/territorial policy experts and tabulated to facilitate qualitative analyses. Impact on access was assessed through a cross-province\/territory comparison of the coverage status of all non-cancer therapies reviewed by the Common Drug Review for indications affecting <1\/2,000 Canadians using the Kappa statistic. Reasons for variations were explored using qualitative techniques.Each province\/territory has formal and informal mechanisms through which such therapies may be accessed. In most cases, formal mechanisms constitute the centralized HTA processes that also apply to common therapies. While several provinces have established dedicated processes\/programs, whether they have affected access is not clear. Despite broadly comparable approaches, there is less than perfect agreement on publicly funded DRDs across jurisdictions.Individual jurisdictions have developed different approaches to providing access to these therapies. However, as the number increases, a more systematic approach to decision-making may be needed.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.longwoods.com\/product\/download\/code\/24360"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"High Expression of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Is Associated with Better Outcome for Patients with Early Stage Lung Adenocarcinoma","abstract":"Abstract Purpose: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key kinase downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\/AKT predominantly involved in translational control in the presence of nutrients and energy. Despite the well known role of mTOR in carcinogenesis, its prognostic potential in lung cancer has not been investigated. Here, we quantitatively assessed mTOR protein expression in two large data sets to investigate the impact of mTOR expression on patient survival. Experimental Design: Automated quantitative analysis (AQUA), a fluorescent-based method for analysis of in situ protein expression, was used to assess mTOR expression in a training cohort of 167 lung cancer patients. An independent cohort of 235 lung cancer patients (from a second institution) was used for validation. Results: Tumors expressed mTOR in the cytoplasm in 56% and 50% of the cases in training and validation cohorts, respectively; mTOR expression was not associated with standard clinical or pathologic characteristics. Patients with high mTOR expression had a longer median overall survival compared with the low expressers (52.7 versus 38.5 months; log rank P = 0.06), which was more prominent in the adenocarcinoma group (55.7 versus 38.88 months; log rank P = 0.018). Multivariate analysis revealed an independent lower risk of death for adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma stage IA patients with mTOR-expressing tumors (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.98; P = 0.04, and hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.72; P = 0.019, respectively). Conclusions: mTOR expression defines a subgroup of patients with a favorable outcome and may be useful for prognostic stratification of lung adenocarcinoma patients as well as incorporation of mTOR into clinical decisions.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/15\/12\/4157.full.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Validity of the French version of the Autonomy Preference Index and its adaptation for patients with advanced cancer","abstract":"While patient-centered care is recommended as a key dimension for quality improvement, in case of serious illness, patients may have different expectations regarding information and participation in medical decision-making. In oncology, anticipation of disease worsening remains difficult, especially when patient's preferences towards prognosis medical information are unclear. Valid tools to explore patients' preferences could help targeting end-of-life discussions, which have been shown to decrease aggressiveness of end-of-life care. Our aim was to establish the validity and reliability of the French version of the Autonomy Preference Index (API) among patients with incurable cancer and in primary care setting. Three supplementary items were specifically developed to evaluate preparedness to anticipate disease deterioration among patients with incurable cancer.The psychometric properties of the API translated into French were assessed among patients consecutively recruited from January to March 2017 in the waiting rooms of 19 general practitioners (N = 391) and in an oncology (N = 187) clinic in Paris. Relationships between the newly-developed items and the API subscale scores were studied.A three correlated factors confirmatory model (two factors related to decision-making and a factor related to information-seeking preferences) showed an acceptable fit on the whole sample and no measurement invariance issue was found across settings, age, sex and educational level. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were acceptable for the information-seeking and decision-making subscales. One of the newly-developed items on patients' ability to anticipate a decision on the use of artificial respiration if a sudden deterioration of their illness occurred was not related to the API subscale scores.The French version of the API was found valid and reliable for use in general practice and oncology settings. The additional items on patient preparedness to anticipate disease deterioration can be of interest to ensure that patient values guide all end-of-life clinical decisions.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0227802&type=printable"},"label_included":1}
