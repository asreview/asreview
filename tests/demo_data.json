{"title":"Role of patient preferences in clinical practice guidelines: a multiple methods study using guidelines from oncology as a case","abstract":"Objective Many treatment decisions are preference-sensitive and call for shared decision-making, notably when benefits are limited or uncertain, and harms impact quality of life. We explored if clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) acknowledge preference-sensitive decisions in how they motivate and phrase their recommendations. Design We performed a qualitative analysis of the content of CPGs and verified the results in semistructured interviews with CPG panel members. Setting Dutch oncology CPGs issued in 2010 or later, concerning primary treatment with curative intent. Participants 14 CPG panel members. Main outcomes For treatment recommendations from six CPG modules, two researchers extracted the following: strength of recommendation in terms of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation and its consistency with the CPG text; completeness of presentation of benefits and harms; incorporation of patient preferences; statements on the panel\u2019s benefits\u2013harm trade-off underlying recommendation; and advice on patient involvement in decision-making. Results We identified 32 recommendations, 18 were acknowledged preference-sensitive decisions. Three of 14 strong recommendations should have been weak based on the module text. The reporting of benefits and harms, and their probabilities, was sufficiently complete and clear to inform the strength of the recommendation in one of the six modules only. Numerical probabilities were seldom presented. None of the modules presented information on patient preferences. CPG panel\u2019s preferences were not made explicit, but appeared to have impacted 15 of 32 recommendations. Advice to involve patients and their preferences in decision-making was given for 20 recommendations (14 weak). Interviewees confirmed these findings. Explanations for lack of information were, for example, that clinicians know the information and that CPGs must be short. Explanations for trade-offs made were cultural-historical preferences, compliance with daily care, presumed role of CPGs and lack of time. Conclusions The motivation and phrasing of CPG recommendations do not stimulate choice awareness and a neutral presentation of options, thus hindering shared decision-making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/9\/12\/e032483.full.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The additional facet of immunoscore: immunoprofiling as a possible predictive tool for cancer treatment","abstract":"Recent investigations of the tumor microenvironment have shown that many tumors are infiltrated by inflammatory and lymphocytic cells. Increasing evidence suggests that the number, type and location of these tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary tumors has prognostic value, and this has led to the development of an \u2018immunoscore. As well as providing useful prognostic information, the immunoscore concept also has the potential to help predict response to treatment, thereby improving decision- making with regard to choice of therapy. This predictive aspect of the tumor microenvironment forms the basis for the concept of immunoprofiling, which can be described as \u2018using an individual\u2019s immune system signature (or profile) to predict that patient\u2019s response to therapy\u2019 The immunoprofile of an individual can be genetically determined or tumor-induced (and therefore dynamic). Ipilimumab is the first in a series of immunomodulating antibodies and has been shown to be associated with improved overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma. Other immunotherapies in development include anti-programmed death 1 protein (nivolumab), anti-PD-ligand 1, anti-CD137 (urelumab), and anti-OX40. Biomarkers that can be used as predictive factors for these treatments have not yet been clinically validated. However, there is already evidence that the tumor microenvironment can have a predictive role, with clinical activity of ipilimumab related to high baseline expression of the immune-related genes FoxP3 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and an increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. These biomarkers could represent the first potential proposal for an immunoprofiling panel in patients for whom anti-CTLA-4 therapy is being considered, although prospective data are required. In conclusion, the evaluation of systemic and local immunological biomarkers could offer useful prognostic information and facilitate clinical decision making. The challenge will be to identify the individual immunoprofile of each patient and the consequent choice of optimal therapy or combination of therapies to be used.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com\/counter\/pdf\/10.1186\/1479-5876-11-54"},"label_included":0}

Five groups of experts directly or indirectly involved in the informed consent process were invited to participate: patients, family members\/friends, physicians, other health professionals and other key informants, including ethicists, contract research staff and pharmaceutical company staff.Of 156 eligible participants, 101 participants (64.7%) completed all three rounds. In round 1, 994 information items were reported and generated into 74 statements. These were grouped under eight headings essential to the informed consent process. In rounds 2 and 3, the list was reduced to 15 statements representing consensus on essential information to be included in a summarised patient information document to support decision-making regarding trial participation. Risks and discomforts, participation requirements and trial governance were identified as important considerations.The 15 essential statements identified in this study could be used as components of a summarised information sheet given to potential cancer clinical trial participants, as an adjunct to the informed consent process.

{"title":"A Ferroptosis-Related Gene Signature Identified as a Novel Prognostic Biomarker for Colon Cancer","abstract":"Colon cancer (CC) is a common gastrointestinal malignant tumor with high heterogeneity in clinical behavior and response to treatment, making individualized survival prediction challenging. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered iron-dependent cell death that plays a critical role in cancer biology. Therefore, identifying a prognostic biomarker with ferroptosis-related genes provides a new strategy to guide precise clinical decision-making in CC patients.Alteration in the expression profile of ferroptosis-related genes was initially screened in GSE39582 dataset involving 585 CC patients. Univariate Cox regression analysis and LASSO-penalized Cox regression analysis were combined to further identify a novel ferroptosis-related gene signature for overall survival prediction. The prognostic performance of the signature was validated in the GSE17536 dataset by Kaplan-Meier survival curve and time-dependent ROC curve analyses. Functional annotation of the signature was explored by integrating GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, GSEA analysis and ssGSEA analysis. Furthermore, an outcome risk nomogram was constructed considering both the gene signature and the clinicopathological features.The prognostic signature biomarker composed of 9 ferroptosis-related genes accurately discriminated high-risk and low-risk patients with CC in both the training and validation datasets. The signature was tightly linked to clinicopathological features and possessed powerful predictive ability for distinct clinical subgroups. Furthermore, the risk score was confirmed to be an independent prognostic factor for CC patients by multivariate Cox regression analysis (p < 0.05). Functional annotation analyses showed that the prognostic signature was closely correlated with pivotal cancer hallmarks, particularly cell cycle, transcriptional regulation, and immune-related functions. Moreover, a nomogram with the signature was also built to quantify outcome risk for each patient.The novel ferroptosis-related gene signature biomarker can be utilized for predicting individualized prognosis, optimizing survival risk assessment and facilitating personalized management of CC patients.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fgene.2021.692426\/pdf"},"label_included":0}

This study evaluated whether a brief psychoeducational intervention was effective in improving patients' attitudes as well as their knowledge, self-efficacy for decision making, receptivity to receiving more information, and general willingness to participate in clinical trials. Patients and Methods A total of 472 adults with cancer who had not been asked previously to participate in a clinical trial were randomly assigned to receive printed educational information about clinical trials or a psychoeducational intervention that provided similar information and also addressed misperceptions and concerns about clinical trials. The primary (attitudes) and secondary outcomes (knowledge, self-efficacy, receptivity, and willingness) were assessed via patient self-report before random assignment and 7 to 28 days later. Results Patients who received the psychoeducational intervention showed more positive attitudes toward clinical trials (P = .016) and greater willingness to participate (P = .011) at follow-up than patients who received printed educational information. Evidence of an indirect effect of intervention assignment on willingness to participate (estimated at 0.168; 95% CI, 0.088 to 0.248) suggested that the benefits of psychoeducation on willingness to participate were explained by the positive impact of psychoeducation on attitudes toward clinical trials. Conclusion A brief psychoeducational intervention can improve the attitudes of patients with cancer toward clinical trials and thereby increase their willingness to participate in clinical trials. Findings support conducting additional research to evaluate effects of this intervention on quality of decision making and rates of participation among patients asked to enroll onto therapeutic clinical trials.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc4577714?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The interactive effect of advanced cancer patient and caregiver prognostic understanding on patients' completion of Do Not Resuscitate orders","abstract":"Advanced cancer patients' prognostic understanding is associated with completion of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders, which often represent engagement in advance care planning (ACP). Given caregivers' critical roles in patient decision-making about ACP and end-of-life care, caregivers' prognostic understanding may have a large additive effect. The present study examined the association between the main and interactive effects of advanced cancer patient and caregiver prognostic understanding on DNR order completion.Data were analyzed from a combined dataset of 2 sequential multi-institutional, longitudinal cohort studies of patients with advanced cancer and their informal caregivers (n = 279 dyads) from 2002 to 2008 (Coping with Cancer 1) and 2010 to 2015 (Coping with Cancer 2). Patients' and caregivers' prognostic understanding regarding life-expectancy (\u2264 12 months [prognostic understanding], >12 months [lack of prognostic understanding]) was assessed. DNR order completion was assessed through self-report and confirmed through cross-checking with medical records.Multivariable modeling of the main and interactive effects revealed the interactive effect, but not the individual effects, of patients' and caregivers' prognostic understanding was significantly associated with higher odds of patients' DNR order completion, adjusting for potential confounds (AOR = 5.89, P = 0.04). For dyads in which both the patient and caregiver had prognostic understanding regarding life expectancy of \u226412 months, 70.7% of patients had completed DNR orders compared with 31.6% to 38.9% in which 1 or both lacked prognostic understanding.Findings highlight the need for ensuring accurate patient and caregiver prognostic understanding in increasing DNR order completion, which may provide a framework for improving engagement in ACP more broadly.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc6589346?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}

We prospectively examined patients' preferences for adjuvant chemotherapy (aCT) and adjuvant hormonal therapy (aHT), factors related to minimally-required benefit, and patients' self-reported motivations.Fifty-two younger (40-64 years) and 29 older (\u2265 65 years) women with a first primary, invasive tumor were interviewed post-surgery, prior to receiving aCT\/aHT recommendation.The proportions of younger versus older participants who would accept, refuse, or were undecided about therapy were 92% versus 62%, 4% versus 24%, and 4% versus 14% for aCT, and 92% versus 59%, 8% versus 17%, and 0% versus 24% for aHT. The proportion of older participants who would refuse rather than accept aCT was larger than that of younger participants (P = .005). No significant difference was found for aHT (P = .12). Younger and older participants' minimally-required benefit, in terms of additional 10-year disease-free survival, to accept aCT (median, 5% vs. 4%; P = .13) or aHT (median, 10% vs. 8%; P = .15) did not differ. Being single\/divorced\/widowed (odds ratio [OR], 0.16; P = .005), presence of geriatric condition (inability to perform daily activities, incontinence, severe sensory impairment, depression, polypharmacy, difficulties with walking; OR, 0.27; P = .047), and having a preference to make the treatment decision either alone or after considering the clinician's opinion (active role; OR, 0.15; P = .012) were independently related to requiring larger benefits from aCT. The most frequent motivations for\/against therapy included the wish to survive\/avoid recurrence, clinician's recommendation, side effects, and treatment duration (only aHT).Whereas older participants were less willing to accept aCT than younger participants, no significant difference was found for aHT. However, a majority of older participants would still accept both therapies. Adjuvant systemic therapy should be discussed with eligible patients regardless of age.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"http:\/\/www.clinical-breast-cancer.com\/article\/S1526820916300830\/pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The role of surgery for stage I non-small cell lung cancer in octogenarians in the era of stereotactic body radiotherapy in the Netherlands","abstract":"Abstract Objectives Resection is the standard treatment for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in operable patients. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is recommended for inoperable patients. A shift from surgery to SBRT is expected in elderly patients due to increased frailty and competing risks. We assessed the current influence of age on treatment decision-making and overall survival (OS). Materials and methods We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from patients with clinical stage I NSCLC diagnosed in 2012\u20132016 and treated with lobectomy, segmentectomy, wedge resection, or SBRT, retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patient characteristics and OS were compared between SBRT and (sub)lobar resection for patients aged 18\u221279 and \u226580 years. Results and Conclusion 8764 patients treated with lobectomy (n\u202f=\u202f4648), segmentectomy (n\u202f=\u202f122), wedge resection (n\u202f=\u202f272), or SBRT (n\u202f=\u202f3722) were included. In 2012\u20132016, SBRT was increasingly used for octogenarians and younger patients from 75.3% to 83.7% and from 30.8% to 43.2%, respectively. Five-year OS in the whole population was 70% after surgery versus 39% after SBRT and 50% versus 27% in octogenarians. After correction for age, gender, year of diagnosis, and clinical T-stage, OS was equal after lobectomy and SBRT in the first 2 years after diagnosis. However, after >2 years, OS was better after lobectomy than after SBRT. SBRT is the prevailing treatment in octogenarians with stage I NSCLC. While surgery is associated with better OS than SBRT, factors other than treatment modality (e.g. comorbidity) may have had a significant impact on survival. The wider application of SBRT in octogenarians likely reflects the frailty of this group. Registries and trials are required to identify key determinants of frailty in this specific population to improve patient selection for surgery or SBRT.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl\/access\/item%3A3280127\/view"},"label_included":0}

We identified 148 young adult patients aged 21-40 years who completed baseline interview questions about cancer treatment decision-making; each was propensity score matched to three middle adult patients aged 41-60 years, for a cohort of 592 patients. Patients were asked about decision-making preferences, family involvement in decision-making, and worries about treatment. An ordinal logistic regression model evaluated factors associated with more treatment worries.Young and middle-aged adults reported similar decision-making preferences (p = 0.80) and roles relative to physicians (p = 0.36). Although family involvement was similar in the age groups (p = 0.21), young adults were more likely to have dependent children in the home (60% younger versus 28% middle-aged adults, p < 0.001). Young adults reported more worries about time away from family (p = 0.002), and, in unadjusted analyses, more cancer treatment-related worries (mean number of responses of 'somewhat' or 'very' worried 2.5 for younger versus 2.2 for middle-aged adults, p = 0.02.) However, in adjusted analyses, worries were associated with the presence of dependent children in the home (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% CI = 1.07-2.24, p = 0.02), rather than age.Young adults involve doctors and family members in decisions at rates similar to middle-aged adults but experience more worries about time away from family. Patients with dependent children are especially likely to experience worries. Treatment decision-making strategies should be based on individual preferences and needs rather than age alone.

Studies have shown that metabolism-related pathways are vital for the development and metastasis of osteosarcoma. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a key role in the occurrence and progression of cancer in a variety of ways. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of metabolism-related lncRNA in osteosarcoma remain to be deeply elucidated.In this study, all metabolism-related mRNAs and lncRNAs in osteosarcoma were extracted and identified based on transcriptomic data from the TCGA database. Usingsurvival analysis, univariate and multivariate independent prognostic analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and nomogram, a prognostic signature with metabolic lncRNAs as prognostic factors was constructed.Nine prognostic factors included lncRNA AC009779.2, lncRNA AL591895.1, lncRNA AC026271.3, lncRNA LPP-AS2, lncRNA LINC01857, lncRNA AP005264.1, lncRNA LINC02454, lncRNA AL133338.1, and lncRNA AC135178.5, respectively. Survival analysis indicated that alterations of specific lncRNA expression were strongly correlated with poor prognosis in osteosarcoma. Univariate and multivariate independent prognostic analysis showed that the prognostic signature had a good independent predictive ability for patient survival. The results of GSEA suggested that these predictors may be involved in the metabolism of certain substances or energy in cancer. The nomogram was further drawn for clinical guidance and assistance in clinical decision-making.This study identified multiple metabolism-related lncRNAs, which may be novel therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma, and contributed to better explore the specific metabolic regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA in osteosarcoma.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/josr-online.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13018-021-02647-4"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The Challenge of Prognosis and Staging for Hepatocellular Carcinoma","abstract":"Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous condition, with multiple confounding factors making patient assessment extremely complex. Tumor burden, the presence of symptoms, liver function, and comorbidities must all be considered to ensure accurate patient assessment, thereby providing physicians with a common language on which to base treatment decisions and guide research. Although many staging classifications have been developed, there is no consensus on the best classification to use. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer system is a promising candidate for a standard western classification, because it has been externally validated and is endorsed by the European Association for the Study of the Liver and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Similarly, the biomarker-combined Japanese Integrated Staging (JIS) score is the most promising candidate for a standard Asia-Pacific classification, because it has been externally validated and shown to be superior to conventional JIS. Because risk factors vary significantly by region, so too does the predictive power of current staging classifications; any standard global staging classification would need to be validated in both western and Asia-Pacific patients. To date, no such globally validated classification exists. Findings from scientific research have improved our understanding of HCC and enabled us to refine current classifications. The role of tumor markers to predict survival was recently reported, and \u03b1-fetoprotein, lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive \u03b1-fetoprotein, and des-\u03b3-carboxyprothrombin have now been incorporated into some classifications. Molecular markers have also been linked with poor outcomes and will likely play a role in future classifications. Although more work is required, it is hoped that these and other ongoing research efforts will eventually enable the development of a global staging classification.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"http:\/\/deepblue.lib.umich.edu\/bitstream\/2027.42\/140053\/1\/onco0023.pdf"},"label_included":0}

A broad PubMed and congress abstract search was carried out in preparation for the meeting to ensure that the latest data and opinion were available for the discussions.In randomised, controlled trials, GnRH antagonist therapy provides more rapid suppression of luteinising hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone than GnRH agonist treatment. Compared with the GnRH agonist, there is evidence of improved disease control by a GnRH antagonist, with longer interval to prostate-specific antigen progression and greater reduction of serum alkaline phosphatase. In a post hoc analysis of six randomised trials, the risk of cardiac events within 1 year of initiating therapy was significantly lower among men receiving GnRH antagonist than agonist. Pre-clinical laboratory data suggest a number of mechanisms whereby GnRH antagonist therapy may benefit men with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD), the most plausible hypothesis being that, unlike GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists do not activate T lymphocytes, which act to increase atherosclerotic plaque rupture.When making treatment decisions, clinicians should consider comorbidities, particularly CVD, in addition to effects on PC.

Materials &amp; methods: Members of several relevant medical organizations in Australia and New Zealand were invited via email to participate in an online survey. Results: A total of 149 respondents, including 40 surgeons, 46 oncologists and 63 breast care nurses, completed the online questionnaire. The majority of respondents believed that TFGT was useful for patient care (87.3%) and valuable for the treatment and management of breast cancer (90.6%). In multivariable analyses, breast care nurses were significantly more likely to agree that TFGT was useful for patient care and the treatment and management of breast cancer compared with oncologists and surgeons (\u03b2 = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.01\u20130.60; p = 0.045). Participants also agreed that TFGT has an impact on treatment decision-making (96.0%), uptake of bilateral mastectomy (98.7%) and uptake of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (98.0%) in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. A slight preference towards surgeons (49.7%) as the best health professional to make the initial offer of TFGT was observed and the majority of respondents suggested the best time to offer TFGT was shortly after diagnosis, when the treatment plan is discussed.

{"title":"Celastrol-induced degradation of FANCD2 sensitizes pediatric high-grade gliomas to the DNA-crosslinking agent carboplatin","abstract":"Abstract Background Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG) are the leading cause of cancer-related death during childhood. Due to their diffuse growth characteristics, chemoresistance and location behind the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the prognosis of pHGG has barely improved in the past decades. As such, there is a dire need for new therapies that circumvent those difficulties. Since aberrant expression of DNA damage-response associated Fanconi anemia proteins play a central role in the onset and therapy resistance of many cancers, we here investigated if FANCD2 depletion could sensitize pHGG to additional DNA damage. Methods We determined the capacity of celastrol, a BBB-penetrable compound that degrades FANCD2, to sensitize glioma cells to the archetypical DNA-crosslinking agent carboplatin in vitro in seven patient-derived pHGG models. In addition, we tested this drug combination in vivo in a patient-derived orthotopic pHGG xenograft model. Underlying mechanisms to drug response were investigated using mRNA expression profiling, western blotting, immunofluorescence, FANCD2 knockdown and DNA fiber assays. Findings FANCD2 is overexpressed in HGGs and depletion of FANCD2 by celastrol synergises with carboplatin to induce cytotoxicity. Combination therapy prolongs survival of pHGG-bearing mice over monotherapy and control groups in vivo (P Interpretation Our results show that depletion of FANCD2 acts as a chemo-sensitizing strategy in pHGG. Combination therapy using celastrol and carboplatin might serve as a clinically relevant strategy for the treatment of pHGG.

{"title":"Multiparametric MRI in the management of prostate cancer: an update\u2014a narrative review","abstract":"The growing interest in multiparametric MRI is leading to important changes in the diagnostic process of prostate cancer. MRI-targeted biopsy is likely to become a standard for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in the next years. Despite it is well known that MRI has no role as a staging technique, it is clear that multiparametric MRI may be of help in active surveillance protocols. Noteworthy, MRI in active surveillance is not recommended, but a proper understanding of its potential may be of help in achieving the goals of a delayed treatment strategy. Moreover, the development of minimally invasive techniques, like laparoscopic and robotic surgery, has led to greater expectations as regard to the functional outcomes of radical prostatectomy. Multiparametric MRI may play a role in planning surgical strategies, with the aim to provide the highest oncologic outcome with a minimal impact on the quality of life. We maintain that a proper anatomic knowledge of prostate lesions may allow the surgeon to achieve a better result in planning as well as in performing surgery and help the surgeon and the patient engage in a shared decision in planning a more effective strategy for prostate cancer control and treatment. This review highlights the advantages and the limitations of multiparametric MRI in prostate cancer diagnosis, in active surveillance and in planning surgery.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/gs.amegroups.com\/article\/viewFile\/58551\/pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Barriers and Facilitators to Fertility-Related Discussions with Teenagers and Young Adults with Cancer: Nurses' Experiences","abstract":"Introduction: Improvements in cancer survival rates for teenagers and young adults (TYAs) have resulted in quality-of-life issues into survivorship becoming increasingly important. However, infertility is a potential late side effect of cancer treatment, which can negatively impact on quality of life. Advances in assisted reproductive technologies have resulted in increasingly effective fertility preservation (FP) options. Purpose: This study aimed to explore nurses' experiences of undertaking fertility-related discussions with TYAs with cancer aged 13-24 years. Methods: An interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach was used. Eleven purposively selected nurses working on a specialist TYA cancer unit participated in semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using IPA. Results: Parents\/family were experienced as self-appointed informal gatekeepers who were perceived to hold the power to control nurses' access to communicate with young people about fertility issues. Nurses adopted a supportive role, which was enhanced by the positive nature of their relationship with the TYA. Uncertainty was expressed over whether the TYA had been fully informed of their infertility risk and potential FP options. Conclusions: Nurses should manage parental involvement sensitively if TYAs are to make informed decisions regarding their future reproductive health. There is a need for clear role delineation in fertility discussions to ensure that TYAs are provided with the opportunity to discuss infertility risk and be referred to a specialist before initiating cancer treatment. Nurses should cultivate the primacy of the nurse-TYA relationship to improve fertility care. Further research into the factors that TYAs may consider beneficial within the nurse-patient relationship is required.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/dora.dmu.ac.uk\/handle\/2086\/19072"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on breast reconstruction","abstract":"With advances in oncologic treatment, cosmesis after mastectomy has assumed a pivotal role in patient and provider decision making. Multiple studies have confirmed the safety of both chemotherapy before breast surgery and immediate reconstruction. Little has been written about the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on decisions about reconstruction.The authors identified 665 patients with stage I through III breast cancer who received chemotherapy and underwent mastectomy at Dana-Farber\/Brigham & Women's Cancer Center from 1997 to 2007. By using multivariate logistic regression, reconstruction rates were compared between patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 180) and patients who underwent mastectomy before chemotherapy (n = 485). The rate of postoperative complications after mastectomy was determined for patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who did not.Reconstruction was performed immediately in 44% of patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy but in only 23% of those who did. Twenty-one percent of neoadjuvant chemotherapy recipients and 14% of adjuvant-only chemotherapy recipients underwent delayed reconstruction. After controlling for age, receipt of radiotherapy, and disease stage, neoadjuvant recipients were less likely to undergo immediate reconstruction (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37, 0.87) but were no more likely to undergo delayed reconstruction (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.75, 2.20). Surgical complications occurred in 30% of neoadjuvant chemotherapy recipients and in 31% of adjuvant chemotherapy recipients.The current results suggest that patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy are less likely to undergo immediate reconstruction and are no more likely to undergo delayed reconstruction than patients who undergo surgery before they receive chemotherapy.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1002\/cncr.25872"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Factors associated with oncology patients' involvement in shared decision making during chemotherapy","abstract":"Oncology patients are increasingly encouraged to play an active role in treatment decision making. While previous studies have evaluated relationships between demographic characteristics and decision-making roles, less is known about the association of symptoms and psychological adjustment characteristics (eg, coping styles and personality traits) and decision-making roles.As part of a larger study of symptom clusters, patients (n = 765) receiving chemotherapy for breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological, or lung cancer provided information on demographic, clinical, symptom, and psychological adjustment characteristics. Patient-reported treatment decision-making roles (ie, preferred role and role actually played) were assessed using the Control Preferences Scale. Differences among patients, who were classified as passive, collaborative, or active, were evaluated using \u03c72 analyses and analyses of variance.Over half (56.3%) of the patients reported that they both preferred and actually played a collaborative role. Among those patients with concordant roles, those who were older, those with less education and lower income, and those who were less resilient were more likely to prefer a passive role. Several psychological adjustment characteristics were associated with decision-making role, including coping style, personality, and fatalism.Oncology patients' preferences for involvement in treatment decision making are associated with demographic characteristics as well as with symptoms and psychological adjustment characteristics, such as coping style and personality. These results reaffirm the complexities of predicting patients' preferences for involvement in decision making. Further study is needed to determine if role or coping style may be influenced by interventions designed to teach adaptive coping skills.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/escholarship.org\/content\/qt4gw3x9sx\/qt4gw3x9sx.pdf?t=qaq0cs"},"label_included":1}

Bereaved Family Member Perceptions of Hospice Referral When Their Family Member Was on Hospice for Seven Days or Less","abstract":"Many family members of patients enrolled in hospice for less than seven days state that the hospice referral was made \"at the right time.\"To examine bereaved family members' perceptions of the timing of hospice referral to identify aspects of the referral process that can be improved.Open-ended interviews were conducted in seven hospice programs, interviewing bereaved family members of hospice patients who died within the first week of hospice enrollment.Of the 100 narrative interviews, 99 respondents stated that their family member was either referred \"too late\" (n=41) or \"at the right time\" (n=58) to hospice services. When families stated that referral was \"at the right time,\" their perceptions were based on the patient having refused earlier referral (n=8), a rapid decline in the patient's condition resulting in the late referral (n=20), or a belief in all things coming together as they were meant to (n=11). In contrast, when families stated that referral was \"too late,\" their reasons were centered on concerns with the health care providers' role in decision making (n=24), with the leading concerns being inadequate physician communication (n=7), not recognizing the patient as dying (n=11), or problematic hospice delays in referral from the nursing home or home health agency (n=4). Despite the patient refusing an earlier hospice referral, five family members believed the referral was \"too late.\"Whereas family members identified expected concerns with communication, more than one in three stated an earlier hospice referral was not possible.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"http:\/\/www.jpsmjournal.com\/article\/S0885392411007664\/pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Dietary changes adopted by Chinese colorectal cancer patients: A qualitative study","abstract":"To explore influences on post-diagnosis dietary decision-making in colorectal cancer survivors (CRC) for future intervention development.Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 CRC survivors. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim for grounded theory analysis.Most CRC survivors interviewed reported making both short- and long-term changes post-diagnosis, influenced by physical symptoms and personal beliefs: short-term treatment-driven changes to facilitate recovery, manage treatment side-effects and avoid disruption in treatment; short-term 'patient role' driven changes heavily influenced by family members and cultural beliefs; long-term changes driven by residual symptoms and illness beliefs, including cancer causal attributions and beliefs about preventing future recurrences. Traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) beliefs were influential in both short- and long-term dietary decision-making, which may explain why survivors focused on specific food items rather than food patterns.While our findings suggested that the majority of CRC survivors made dietary changes post-diagnosis, their dietary pattern and motivation may change over the course of their illness trajectory. Also, the types of changes made are often not consistent with existing dietary recommendations. It is necessary to consider illness perception and cultural beliefs when delivering dietary care or developing interventions for this population.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/ecc.13159"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Training recruiters to randomized trials to facilitate recruitment and informed consent by exploring patients' treatment preferences","abstract":"Patients' treatment preferences are often cited as barriers to recruitment in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We investigated how RCT recruiters reacted to patients' treatment preferences and identified key strategies to improve informed decision-making and trial recruitment.Audio-recordings of 103 RCT recruitment appointments with 96 participants in three UK multicenter pragmatic RCTs were analyzed using content and thematic analysis. Recruiters' responses to expressed treatment preferences were assessed in one RCT (ProtecT - Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment) in which training on exploring preferences had been given, and compared with two other RCTs where this specific training had not been given.Recruiters elicited treatment preferences similarly in all RCTs but responses to expressed preferences differed substantially. In the ProtecT RCT, patients' preferences were not accepted at face value but were explored and discussed at length in three key ways: eliciting and acknowledging the preference rationale, balancing treatment views, and emphasizing the need to keep an open mind and consider all treatments. By exploring preferences, recruiters enabled participants to become clearer about whether their views were robust enough to be sustained or were sufficiently weak that participation in the RCT became possible. Conversely, in the other RCTs, treatment preferences were often readily accepted without further discussion or understanding the reasoning behind them, suggesting that patients were not given the opportunity to fully consider all treatments and trial participation.Recruiters can be trained to elicit and address patients' treatment preferences, enabling those who may not have considered trial participation to do so. Without specific guidance, some RCT recruiters are likely to accept initial preferences at face value, missing opportunities to promote more informed decision-making. Training interventions for recruiters that incorporate key strategies to manage treatment preferences, as in the ProtecT study, are required to facilitate recruitment and informed consent.ProtecT RCT: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN20141297.

{"title":"GPs\u2019 use of gut feelings when assessing cancer risk: a qualitative study in UK primary care","abstract":"Background The use of gut feelings to guide clinical decision making in primary care has been frequently described but is not considered a legitimate reason for cancer referral. Aim To explore the role that gut feeling plays in clinical decision making in primary care. Design and setting Qualitative interview study with 19 GPs in Oxfordshire, UK. Method GPs who had referred patients to a cancer pathway based on a gut feeling as a referral criterion were invited to participate. Interviews were conducted between November 2019 and January 2020, and transcripts were analysed using the one sheet of paper method. Results Gut feeling was seen as an essential part of decision making that facilitated appropriate and timely care. GPs distanced their gut feelings from descriptions that could be seen as unscientific, describing successful use as reliant on experience and clinical knowledge. This was especially true for patients who fell within a \u2018grey area\u2019 where clinical guidelines did not match the GP\u2019s assessment of cancer risk, either because the guidance inadequately represented or did not include the patient\u2019s presentation. GPs sought to legitimise their gut feelings by gathering objective clinical evidence, careful examination of referral procedures, and consultation with colleagues. Conclusion GPs described their gut feelings as important to decision making in primary care and a necessary addition to clinical guidance. The steps taken to legitimise their gut feelings matched that expected in good clinical practice.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"https:\/\/bjgp.org\/content\/bjgp\/71\/706\/e356.full.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Liquid biopsy and its role in an advanced clinical trial for lung cancer","abstract":"Liquid biopsy methodologies, for the purpose of plasma genotyping of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of solid tumors, are a new class of novel molecular assays. Such assays are rapidly entering the clinical sphere of research-based monitoring in translational oncology, especially for thoracic malignancies. Potential applications for these blood-based cfDNA assays include: (i) initial diagnosis, (ii) response to therapy and follow-up, (iii) tumor evolution, and (iv) minimal residual disease evaluation. Precision medicine will benefit from cutting-edge molecular diagnostics, especially regarding treatment decisions in the adjuvant setting, where avoiding over-treatment and unnecessary toxicity are paramount. The use of innovative genetic analysis techniques on individual patient tumor samples is being pursued in several advanced clinical trials. Rather than using a categorical treatment plan, the next critical step of therapeutic decision making is providing the \u201cright\u201d cancer therapy for an individual patient, including correct dose and timeframe based on the molecular analysis of the tumor in question. Per the 21st Century Cures Act, innovative clinical trials are integral for biomarker and drug development. This will include advanced clinical trials utilizing: (i) innovative assays, (ii) molecular profiling with cutting-edge bioinformatics, and (iii) clinically relevant animal or tissue models. In this paper, a mini-review addresses state-of-the-art liquid biopsy approaches. Additionally, an on-going advanced clinical trial for lung cancer with novelty through synergizing liquid biopsies, co-clinical trials, and advanced bioinformatics is also presented. Impact statement Liquid biopsy technology is providing a new source for cancer biomarkers, and adds new dimensions in advanced clinical trials. Utilizing a non-invasive routine blood draw, the liquid biopsy provides abilities to address perplexing issues of tumor tissue heterogeneity by identifying mutations in both primary and metastatic lesions. Regarding the assessment of response to cancer therapy, the liquid biopsy is not ready to replace medical imaging, but adds critical new information; for instance, through a temporal assessment of quantitative circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay results, and importantly, the ability to monitor for signs of resistance, via emerging clones. Adjuvant therapy may soon be considered based on a quantitative cfDNA assay. As sensitivity and specificity of the technology continue to progress, cancer screening and prevention will improve and save countless lives by finding the cancer early, so that a routine surgery may be all that is required for a definitive cure.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc5813874?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Perioperative chemotherapy for bladder cancer: A qualitative study of physician knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour","abstract":"Introduction: Use of chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is known to be low. To understand factors driving practice we use the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify barriers and enablers of chemotherapy use.Methods: A convenience sample of Canadian urologists, medical oncologists (MOs), and radiation oncologists (ROs) participated in individual, semi-structured, one-hour telephone interviews. An interview guide was developed using the TDF to assess potential barriers and enablers of chemotherapy use. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Two investigators independently identified barriers and enablers and assigned them to specific themes. Participant recruitment continued until saturation.Results: A total of 71 physicians were invited to participate and 34 (48%) agreed to be interviewed: 13 urologists, 10 MOs, and 11 ROs. We identified the following barriers to the use of chemotherapy (relevant TDF domains in parentheses): 1) belief that the benefits of chemotherapy are not clinically important (beliefs about consequences); 2) inadequate multidisciplinary collaboration (environmental context and resources); 3) absence of \u201cchampions\u201d advocating the use of chemotherapy (social and professional role); and 4) a lack of organizational clarity\/policy regarding the referral process (environmental context and resources). The predominant enablers identified included: 1) \u201cchampions\u201d who believe in the value of chemotherapy (social and professional role); 2) urologists who refer all patients to MO (behavioural regulation; memory, attention, and decision-making); and 3) system-level factors, including automatic multidisciplinary referral (environmental context and resources).Conclusions: We have identified several system-level factors associated with delivery of chemotherapy. Behaviour change interventions should optimize multidisciplinary care of patients with MIBC.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/cuaj.ca\/index.php\/journal\/article\/download\/4791\/3438"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Decision Making in Patients with Pulmonary Nodules","abstract":"Integrating current evidence with fundamental concepts from decision analysis suggests that management of patients with pulmonary nodules should begin with estimating the pretest probability of cancer from the patient's clinical risk factors and computed tomography characteristics. Then, the consequences of treatment should be considered, by comparing the benefits of surgery if the patient has lung cancer with the potential harm if the patient does not have cancer. This analysis determines the \"treatment threshold,\" which is the point around which the decision centers. This varies widely among patients depending on their cardiopulmonary reserve, comorbidities, and individual preferences. For patients with a very low probability of cancer, careful observation with serial computed tomography is warranted. For those with a high probability of cancer, surgical diagnosis is warranted. For patients in the intermediate range of probabilities, either computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy or positron emission tomography, possibly followed by computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy, is best. Patient preferences should be considered because the absolute difference in outcome between strategies may be small. The optimal approach to the management of patients with pulmonary nodules is evolving as technologies develop. Areas of uncertainty include quantifying the hazard of delayed diagnosis; determining the optimal duration of follow-up for ground-glass and semisolid opacities; establishing the roles of volumetric imaging, advanced bronchoscopic technologies, and limited surgical resections; and calculating the cost-effectiveness of different strategies.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc3361350?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Needs assessment for a decision support tool in oral cancer requiring major resection and reconstruction: a mixed-methods study protocol","abstract":"Introduction Advanced oral cancer and its ensuing treatment engenders significant morbidity and mortality. Patients are often elderly with significant comorbidities. Toxicities associated with surgical resection can be devastating and they are often highlighted by patients as impactful. Given the potential for suboptimal oncological and functional outcomes in this vulnerable patient population, promotion and performance of shared decision making (SDM) is crucial. Decision aids (DAs) are useful instruments for facilitating the SDM process by presenting patients with up-to-date evidence regarding risks, benefits and the possible postoperative course. Importantly, DAs also help elicit and clarify patient values and preferences. The use of DAs in cancer treatment has been shown to reduce decisional conflict and increase SDM. No DAs for oral cavity cancer have yet been developed. This study endeavours to answer the question: Is there a patient or surgeon driven need for development and implementation of a DA for adult patients considering major surgery for oral cancer? Methods and analysis This study is the first step in a multiphase investigation of SDM during major head and neck surgery. It is a multi-institutional convergent parallel mixed-methods needs assessment study. Patients and surgeon dyads will be recruited to complete questionnaires related to their perception of the SDM process (nine-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire, SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc) and to take part in semistructured interviews. Patients will also complete questionnaires examining decisional self-efficacy (Ottawa Decision Self-Efficacy Scale) and decisional conflict (Decisional Conflict Scale). Questionnaires will be completed at time of recruitment and will be used to assess the current level of SDM, self-efficacy and conflict in this setting. Thematic analysis will be used to analyse transcripts of interviews. Quantitative and qualitative components of the study will be integrated through triangulation, with matrix developed to promote visualisation of the data. Ethics and Dissemination This study has been approved by the research ethics boards of the Nova Scotia Health Authority (Halifax, Nova Scotia) and the University Health Network (Toronto, Ontario). Dissemination to clinicians will be through traditional approaches and creation of a head and neck cancer SDM website. Dissemination to patients will include a section within the website, patient advocacy groups and postings within clinical environments.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/10\/11\/e036969.full.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for treating newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia in older adults","abstract":"Abstract Background: Older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represent a vulnerable population in whom disease-based and clinical risk factors, patient goals, prognosis, and practitioner- and patient-perceived treatment risks and benefits influence treatment recommendations. Objective: These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about management of AML in older adults. Methods: ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included specialists in myeloid leukemia, geriatric oncology, patient-reported outcomes and decision-making, frailty, epidemiology, and methodology, as well as patients. The McMaster Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Centre supported the guideline-development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews (up to 24 May 2019). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance to patients, as judged by the panel. The panel used the GRADE approach, including GRADE\u2019s Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment. Results: The panel agreed on 6 critical questions in managing older adults with AML, mirroring real-time practitioner-patient conversations: the decision to pursue antileukemic treatment vs best supportive management, the intensity of therapy, the role and duration of postremission therapy, combination vs monotherapy for induction and beyond, duration of less-intensive therapy, and the role of transfusion support for patients no longer receiving antileukemic therapy. Conclusions: Treatment is recommended over best supportive management. More-intensive therapy is recommended over less-intensive therapy when deemed tolerable. However, these recommendations are guided by the principle that throughout a patient\u2019s disease course, optimal care involves ongoing discussions between clinicians and patients, continuously addressing goals of care and the relative risk-benefit balance of treatment.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1182\/bloodadvances.2020001920"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The relation between cancer patient treatment decision-making roles and quality of life","abstract":"BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to explore relations between patient role preferences during the cancer treatment decision-making process and quality of life (QOL). METHODS One-year cancer survivors completed a survey in 2000 as part of a larger survey conducted by the American Cancer Society. The current report was based on survey respondents from Minnesota (response rate, 37.4%). Standardized measures included the Profile of Mood States (scores were converted to have a range, from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating the best mood), the Medical Outcomes Survey 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) (standardized scores), and the Control Preferences Scale. Patients' actual and preferred role preference distributions and concordance between roles were compared with QOL scores using 2-sample t test methodology. RESULTS The actual role of survivors (n = 594) in cancer care was 33% active, 50% collaborative, and 17% passive. Their preferred role was 35% active, 53% collaborative, and 13% passive. Overall, 88% of survivors had concordant preferred and actual roles. Survivors who had concordant roles had higher SF-36 Physical Component Scale (PCS) scores (P < .01), higher vitality (P = .01), less fatigue (P < .01), less confusion (P = .01), less anger (P = .046), and better overall mood (P = .01). These results were similar among both women and younger individuals (aged <60 years). Survivors who had active actual roles had higher PCS scores (P < .01), less tension (P = .04), and higher vitality (P = .04) than survivors who were either collaborative or passive. No differences existed in QOL scores according to preferred role. CONCLUSIONS Survivors who experienced discordance between their actual role and their preferred role reported substantial QOL deficits in both physical and emotional domains. These results indicate the need to support patient preferences.

BM are detected in up to 80% of all patients at autopsy. After primary treatment, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been established as standard of care in SCLC patients responding to initial therapy. Based on level I evidence, PCI significantly decreases the risk of intracranial relapse and shows a modest survival benefit after 3 years. However, the role of PCI in defined patient subgroups such as resected SCLC, elderly and extensive stage patients with access to magnetic resonance imaging surveillance and stereotactic radiotherapy is yet to be fully clarified. Furthermore, strategies to effective prevention of neurocognitive decline after PCI remain unclear. All these factors significantly impact treatment decision making and should be evaluated in prospective settings. New concepts such as hippocampal avoidance and drug neuroprotection prevent chronic neurocognitive effects reducing treatment-related side effects of PCI. The aim of this review is to present a summary and update of the latest evidence for patient selection, efficacy and outcome of PCI.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=43718"},"label_included":0}

Despite increasing recognition that providers should play a role in reducing care costs, how physicians across cancer specialties differ in their cost-consciousness has not been reported. We examined cost-consciousness regarding breast cancer care among medical oncologists, surgeons, and radiation oncologists.We identified 514 cancer surgeons, 504 medical oncologists, and 251 radiation oncologists by patient report through the iCanCare study. iCanCare identified newly diagnosed women with breast cancer through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries of Georgia and Los Angeles. We queried providers on three dimensions of cost-consciousness: (1) perceived importance of cost saving for society, patients, practice, and payers; (2) awareness of patient out-of-pocket expenses; and (3) discussion of financial burden.We received responses from 376 surgeons (73%), 304 medical oncologists (60%), and 169 radiation oncologists (67%). Overall levels of cost-consciousness were moderate, with scores ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 out of 5. After adjusting for covariates, surgeons had the lowest scores on all three cost-consciousness measures; medical oncologists had the highest scores. Pairwise contrasts showed surgeons had significantly lower scores than medical oncologists for all three measures and significantly lower scores than radiation oncologists for two of the three cost-consciousness variables: importance of cost saving and discussion of financial burden.How cost-consciousness impacts medical decision-making across specialty and how policy, structural, and behavioral interventions might sensitize providers regarding cost-related matters merit further examination.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8968296"},"label_included":0}

The present analysis was performed to compare long-term adverse events (AE) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Methods and Materials<\/h3> In the study, 660 women with high-risk endometrial cancer were randomly assigned to receive chemoradiation therapy (2 concurrent cycles of cisplatin followed by 4 cycles of carboplatin\/paclitaxel) or radiation therapy alone. Toxicity was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. HRQOL was measured using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CX24\/OV28 subscales and compared with normative data. An as-treated analysis was performed. <h3>Results<\/h3> Median follow-up was 74.6 months; 574 (87%) patients were evaluable for HRQOL. At 5 years, grade \u22652 AE were scored for 78 (38%) patients who had received chemoradiation therapy versus 46 (24%) who had received radiation therapy alone (<i>P<\/i> = .008). Grade 3 AE did not differ significantly between the groups (8% vs 5%, <i>P<\/i> = .18) at 5 years, and only one new late grade 4 toxicity had been reported. At 3 and 5 years, sensory neuropathy toxicity grade \u22652 persisted after chemoradiation therapy in 6% (vs 0% after radiation therapy, <i>P<\/i> < .001) and more patients reported significant tingling or numbness at HRQOL (27% vs 8%, <i>P<\/i> < .001 at 3 years; 24% vs 9%, <i>P<\/i> = .002 at 5 years). Up to 3 years, more patients who had chemoradiation therapy reported limb weakness (21% vs 5%, <i>P<\/i> < .001) and lower physical (79 vs 87, <i>P<\/i> < .001) and role functioning (78 vs 88, <i>P<\/i> < .001) scores.

On the other hand, unnecessary admissions to these units lead to increased morbidity - nosocomial infections, increased length of hospital stay and higher hospital costs. Gynaecological oncology surgeons continue to look after their patient in the HDU\/SICU and have the final role in decision-making on day-to-day basis, making it important to be well versed in critical care management and ensure the best care for their patients. Post-operative monitoring and the presence of comorbid illnesses are the most common reasons for admission to the HDU\/SICU. Elderly and malnutritioned patients, as well as, bowel resection, blood loss or greater fluid resuscitation during the surgery have prolonged HDU\/SICU stay.

{"title":"Patient Perspectives on the Risk-Based NLST Outcomes Tool for Lung Cancer Screening","abstract":"Researchers at the NCI have developed the Risk-Based NLST Outcomes Tool (RNOT), an online tool that calculates risk of lung cancer diagnosis and death with and without lung cancer screening, and false-positive risk estimates. This tool has the potential to facilitate shared decision making for screening. The objective of this study was to examine how current heavy and former smokers understand and respond to personalized risk estimates from the RNOT. Individuals who were eligible for lung cancer screening and were visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview to assess their experiences with and perceptions of the RNOT. Results were analyzed using template analysis. Participants found their risk of lung cancer death to be lower than anticipated and were confused by changes in risk for lung cancer diagnosis with and without screening. Most participants indicated that the RNOT would be helpful in making screening decisions, despite reporting that there was no maximum risk for a false positive that would lead them to forgo lung cancer screening. Participants provided actionable needs and recommendations to optimize this tool. Risk-based screening tools may enhance shared decision making. The RNOT is being updated to incorporate these findings.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9190214"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Emerging tumor spheroids technologies for 3D in vitro cancer modeling","abstract":"Cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Around 90% of deaths are caused by metastasis and just 10% by primary tumor. The advancement of treatment approaches is not at the same rhythm of the disease; making cancer a focal target of biomedical research. To enhance the understanding and prompts the therapeutic delivery; concepts of tissue engineering are applied in the development of in vitro models that can bridge between 2D cell culture and animal models, mimicking tissue microenvironment. Tumor spheroid represents highly suitable 3D organoid-like framework elucidating the intra and inter cellular signaling of cancer, like that formed in physiological niche. However, spheroids are of limited value in studying critical biological phenomenon such as tumor-stroma interactions involving extra cellular matrix or immune system. Therefore, a compelling need of tailoring spheroid technologies with physiologically relevant biomaterials or in silico models, is ever emerging. The diagnostic and prognostic role of spheroids rearrangements within biomaterials or microfluidic channel is indicative of patient management; particularly for the decision of targeted therapy. Fragmented information on available in vitro spheroid models and lack of critical analysis on transformation aspects of these strategies; pushes the urge to comprehensively overview the recent technological advancements (e.g. bioprinting, micro-fluidic technologies or use of biomaterials to attain the third dimension) in the shed of translationable cancer research. In present article, relationships between current models and their possible exploitation in clinical success is explored with the highlight of existing challenges in defining therapeutic targets and screening of drug efficacy.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt\/bitstream\/1822\/51321\/1\/19251-T.%20Rodrigues%20et%20al.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Predictors of Treatment Decisions in Multidisciplinary Oncology Meetings: A Quantitative Observational Study","abstract":"In many healthcare systems, treatment recommendations for cancer patients are formulated by multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs). Evidence suggests that interdisciplinary contributions to case reviews in the meetings are unequal and information-sharing suboptimal, with biomedical information dominating over information on patient comorbidities and psychosocial factors. This study aimed to evaluate how different elements of the decision process affect the teams' ability to reach a decision on first case review.This was an observational quantitative assessment of 1045 case reviews from 2010 to 2014 in cancer MTBs using a validated tool, the Metric for the Observation of Decision-making. This tool allows evaluation of the quality of information presentation (case history, radiological, pathological, and psychosocial information, comorbidities, and patient views), and contribution to discussion by individual core specialties (surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, and specialist cancer nurses). The teams' ability to reach a decision was a dichotomous outcome variable (yes\/no).Using multiple logistic regression analysis, the significant positive predictors of the teams' ability to reach a decision were patient psychosocial information (odds ratio [OR] 1.35) and the inputs of surgeons (OR 1.62), radiologists (OR 1.48), pathologists (OR 1.23), and oncologists (OR 1.13). The significant negative predictors were patient comorbidity information (OR 0.83) and nursing inputs (OR 0.87).Multidisciplinary inputs into case reviews and patient psychosocial information stimulate decision making, thereby reinforcing the role of MTBs in cancer care in processing such information. Information on patients' comorbidities, as well as nursing inputs, make decision making harder, possibly indicating that a case is complex and requires more detailed review. Research should further define case complexity and determine ways to better integrate patient psychosocial information into decision making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/kclpure.kcl.ac.uk\/portal\/files\/88525887\/Predictors_of_treatment_decisions_SOUKUP_Publishedonline5July2016_GREEN_AAM.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Surgery for high-risk localized prostate cancer","abstract":"Treatment of men with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) remains challenging for urologists. The complex natural history of high-risk PCa and the lack of specific and accurate definitions for high-risk disease impede treatment decision making. Historically, surgery in this patient group has been avoided based on the perception of ostensibly higher complication rates associated with inferior functional and oncological outcomes. To date, no randomized data comparing different therapy approaches have been made available. Several investigators have reported that continence rates in patients after radical prostatectomy (RP) for high-risk disease seem to be unaffected. Similarly, in a large proportion of these men, a nerve-sparing procedure can be performed without a significant negative impact on surgical margin rates and with comparable potency results. Moreover, extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) contributes to accurate pathological staging with a marginal effect on perioperative morbidity. With regards to the benefits of RP on local recurrence and cure rates, realistic expectations regarding the success of RP alone or in the context of a multimodal approach should be provided during patient counseling.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc3175701?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}

The concept of shared decision-making (SDM: information; values\/preferences; involvement) was used as a matrix for the analyses. To validate findings, additional focus group discussions using the nominal group technique were performed.Lack of knowledge of CRC and CRC screening was prominent for participants and non-participants, while the results differed between the groups in relation to their values and preferences. The influence of significant others promoted participation while it prevented it among non-participants. Those who participated and those who did not made it clear that there was no need to involve health care professionals when making the decision.Based on the results, a display of different ways to spread knowledge and communicate about CRC and CRC-screening could be applied such as, community-based information campaigns, decisions aids, interactive questionnaires, chat-functions and telephone support. The disparity in values and preferences between participants and non-participants may be the key to understand why non-participants make their decisions not to participate and warrant further exploration.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/eurpub\/article-pdf\/27\/6\/1079\/21962516\/ckw266.pdf"},"label_included":0}

This study is a post hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of an SDM intervention. The SDM intervention was a 12-h SDM training program for physicians in combination with decision board use. For this study, we analysed a subgroup of 107 breast and colon cancer patients faced with serious treatment decisions who provided data on specific questionnaires with regard to their preferred and perceived decision-making roles (passive, SDM or active). Patients filled in questionnaires immediately following a decision-relevant consultation (t1) with their oncologist. Eleven of these patients' 27 treating oncologists had received the SDM intervention within the RCT. A majority of cancer patients (60%) preferred SDM. A match between preferred and perceived decision-making roles was reached for 72% of patients. The patients treated by SDM-trained physicians perceived greater autonomy in their decision making (p < 0.05) with more patients perceiving SDM or an active role, but their preference matching was not influenced. A SDM intervention for oncologists boosted patient autonomy but did not improve preference matching.

The role of robotic surgery in gynecologic oncology has become increasingly prominent; however limited data are available on quality of life (QOL) after robotic surgery.In this prospective, IRB-approved study, women scheduled for robotic surgery for a gynecologic indication between May 2008 and February 2012 completed validated QOL measures at baseline, 6 weeks (6wk), and 4 months postoperative (4mo). Functional status (SF-12), symptom severity and interference (MDASI), sexual function (FSFI), and satisfaction with decision (SWD) were assessed at relevant time points. Differences between groups were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test.Among 408 women who underwent robotic surgery 278 (68%) completed the QOL measures. Median age was 55.6 years (range 25.7-85.1). Median BMI was 31.3kg\/m(2). The majority of patients were white (75%). The most common indication for surgery was endometrial cancer\/hyperplasia (59.7%). While physical functioning declined from baseline to 6wk (51.4 to 41.6, p<0.001), it improved by 4mo (53.5). Mental functioning improved over time (baseline 48.6, 6wk 52.8, and 4mo 55.6, p<0.001). Symptom severity decreased over time (p<0.001) as did symptom interference (p<0.001). Sexual function improved significantly from baseline (8.6) to 4mo (20.2, p<0.001). Patients were satisfied with their decision making (SWD=30).In this prospective study, general health, symptom burden and sexual function returned to or improved beyond baseline levels within 6 weeks of surgery.

{"title":"Identification of Astrocytoma Blood Serum Protein Profile","abstract":"High-grade astrocytomas are some of the most common and aggressive brain cancers, whose signs and symptoms are initially non-specific. Up to the present date, there are no diagnostic tools to observe the early onset of the disease. Here, we analyzed the combination of blood serum proteins, which may play key roles in the tumorigenesis and the progression of glial tumors. Fifty-nine astrocytoma patients and 43 control serums were analyzed using Custom Human Protein Antibody Arrays, including ten targets: ANGPT1, AREG, IGF1, IP10, MMP2, NCAM1, OPN, PAI1, TGF\u03b21, and TIMP1. The decision tree analysis indicates that serums ANGPT1, TIMP1, IP10, and TGF\u03b21 are promising combinations of targets for glioma diagnostic applications. The accuracy of the decision tree algorithm was 73.5% (75\/102), which correctly classified 79.7% (47\/59) astrocytomas and 65.1% (28\/43) healthy controls. The analysis revealed that the relative value of osteopontin (OPN) protein level alone predicted the 12-month survival of glioblastoma (GBM) patients with the specificity of 84%, while the inclusion of the IP10 protein increased model predictability to 92.3%. In conclusion, the serum protein profiles of ANGPT1, TIMP1, IP10, and TGF\u03b21 were associated with the presence of astrocytoma independent of its malignancy grade, while OPN and IP10 were associated with GBM patient survival.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4409\/9\/1\/16\/pdf?version=1577352521"},"label_included":0}

The aim of the study was to determine the frequency and factors associated with inaccurate perception of curability among advanced cancer patients receiving palliative care across the globe. Materials and Methods Secondary analysis of a study to understand the core concepts in end-of-life care among advanced cancer patients receiving palliative care from 11 countries across the world. Advanced cancer patients were surveyed using a Patient Illness Understanding survey and Control Preference Scale. Descriptive statistics and multicovariate logistic regression analysis were performed. Results Fifty-five percent (763\/1,390) of patients receiving palliative care inaccurately reported that their cancer is curable. The median age was 58, 55% were female, 59% were married or had a partner, 48% were Catholic, and 35% were college educated. Sixty-eight percent perceived that the goal of therapy was \u201cto get rid of their cancer,\u201d and 47% perceived themselves as \u201cseriously ill.\u201d Multicovariate logistic regression analysis shows that accurate perception of curability was associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR] 0.73, p = .027), higher education (OR 0.37, p &amp;lt; .0001), unemployment status (OR 0.69, p = .02), and being from France (OR 0.26, p &amp;lt; .0001) and South Africa (OR 0.52, p = .034); inaccurate perception of curability was associated with better Karnofsky performance status (OR 1.02 per point, p = .0005), and being from Philippines (OR 15.49, p &amp;lt; .0001), Jordan (OR 8.43, p &amp;lt; .0001), Brazil (OR 2.17, p = .0037), and India (OR 2.47, p = .039). Conclusion Inaccurate perception of curability in advanced cancer patients is 55% and significantly differs by gender, education, performance status, employment status, and country of origin. Further studies are needed to develop strategies to reduce this misperception of curability in advanced cancer patients. Implications for Practice The findings of this study indicate that inaccurate perception of curability among advanced cancer patients is 55%. Inaccurate perception of curability significantly differs by gender, education, performance status, employment status, and country of origin.

{"title":"Practitioners\u2019 perceptions of acceptability of a question prompt list about palliative care for advance care planning with people living with dementia and their family caregivers: a mixed-methods evaluation study","abstract":"Objectives In oncology and palliative care, patient question prompt lists (QPLs) with sample questions for patient and family increased patients\u2019 involvement in decision-making and improved outcomes if physicians actively endorsed asking questions. Therefore, we aim to evaluate practitioners\u2019 perceptions of acceptability and possible use of a QPL about palliative and end-of-life care in dementia. Design Mixed-methods evaluation study of a QPL developed with family caregivers and experts comprising a survey and interviews with practitioners. Setting Two academic medical training centres for primary and long-term care in the Netherlands. Participants Practitioners (n=66; 73% woman; mean of 21 (SD 11) years of experience) who were mostly general practitioners and elderly care physicians. Outcomes The main survey outcome was acceptability measured with a 15\u201375 acceptability scale with \u226545 meaning \u2018acceptable\u2019. Results The survey response rate was 21% (66 of 320 participated). The QPL was regarded as acceptable (mean 51, SD 10) but 64% felt it was too long. Thirty-five per cent would want training to be able to answer the questions. Those who felt unable to answer (31%) found the QPL less acceptable (mean 46 vs 54 for others; p=0.015). We identified three themes from nine interviews: (1) enhancing conversations through discussing difficult topics, (2) proactively engaging in end-of-life conversations and (3) possible implementation. Conclusion Acceptability of the QPL was adequate, but physicians feeling confident to be able to address questions about end-of-life care is crucial when implementing it in practice, and may require training. To facilitate discussions of advance care planning and palliative care, families and persons with dementia should also be empowered to access the QPL themselves.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/11\/4\/e044591.full.pdf"},"label_included":0}

{"title":"Mucosal inflammation predicts response to systemic steroids in immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis","abstract":"Immune-related colitis is a common, often serious complication of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Although endoscopy is not strictly recommended for any grade of diarrhea\/colitis, emerging evidence suggests that endoscopic evaluation may have important therapeutic implications. In this retrospective study, we sought to comprehensively characterize the clinical and histologic features of ICI-induced colitis with a specific focus on evaluating the prognostic role of endoscopy.Data were collected from the medical records of 130 patients with confirmed ICI-induced colitis. In a subset of patients (n=44) with endoscopic and pathologic data, endoscopic data were scored using the Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES) with scores ranging from 0 (no inflammation) to 3 (colonic ulceration). The impact of infliximab on antitumor outcomes was evaluated using progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).We identified 130 patients with ICI-induced colitis across two institutions. All patients were treated with corticosteroids. Additional and\/or alternative immunosuppression was employed in 59 cases, with 52 patients (42%) requiring at least one infusion of infliximab 5 mg\/kg. Endoscopic assessment with biopsy was performed in 123 cases of suspected colitis (95%), with 44 cases available for MES tabulation. Presence of ulceration (MES 3) was associated with use of infliximab (p=0.008) and MES was significantly higher in patients who received infliximab compared with those who did not (p=0.003) with a median score of 2.5; conversely, those with an MES of zero rarely required secondary immunosuppression. Notably, symptoms of colitis based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade had no association with endoscopic findings based on MES classification. After adjustment for baseline patient and disease characteristics, there was no significant difference in steroid duration or cancer-related outcomes in patients treated with infliximab.In our study, we demonstrate the association of endoscopic features, specifically the MES, with immunosuppressive needs. Importantly, we also show that MES was not related to severity of patient symptoms. The data suggest that endoscopic features can guide clinical decision-making better than patient symptoms, both identifying high-risk patients who will require infliximab and those who are likely to respond to initial corticosteroids.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/jitc.bmj.com\/content\/jitc\/8\/1\/e000451.full.pdf"},"label_included":0}

Objective Our aim was to explore patient and physician perceptions of shared decision making in clinical encounters for cancer care.  Design Patients and physicians were asked open-ended questions regarding their perceptions of shared decision making throughout their cancer care. Transcripts of interviews were coded and analysed for shared decision-making themes.  Setting and participants At an academic medical centre, 20 cancer patients with a range of cancer diagnoses, stages of cancer and time from diagnosis, and eight physicians involved in cancer care were individually interviewed.  Discussion and conclusions Most physicians reported providing patients with written information. However, most patients reported that written information was too detailed and felt that the physicians did not assess the level of information they wished to receive. Most patients wanted to play an active role in the treatment decision, but also wanted the physician's recommendation, such as what their physician would choose for him\/herself or a family member in a similar situation. While physicians stated that they incorporated patient autonomy in decision making, most provided data without making treatment recommendations in the format preferred by most patients. We identified several communication gaps in cancer care. While patients want to be involved in the decision-making process, they also want physicians to provide evidence-based recommendations in the context of their individual preferences. However, physicians often are reluctant to provide a recommendation that will bias the patient.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/hex.12564"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Barrett's esophagus: review of diagnosis and treatment","abstract":"Barrett's esophagus (BE) is an acquired condition characterized by replacement of stratified squamous epithelium by a cancer predisposing metaplastic columnar epithelium. Endoscopy with systemic biopsy protocols plays a vital role in diagnosis. Technological advancements in dysplasia detection improves outcomes in surveillance and treatment of patients with BE and dysplasia. These advances in endoscopic technology radically changed the treatment for dysplastic BE and early cancer from being surgical to organ-sparing endoscopic therapy. A multimodal treatment approach combining endoscopic resection of visible and\/or raised lesions with ablation techniques for flat BE mucosa, followed by long-term surveillance improves the outcomes of BE. Safe and effective endoscopic treatment can be either tissue acquiring as in endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection or tissue ablative as with photodynamic therapy, radiofrequency ablation and cryotherapy. Debatable issues such as durability of response, recognition and management of sub-squamous BE and optimal management strategy in patients with low-grade dysplasia and non-dysplastic BE need to be studied further. Development of safer wide field resection techniques, which would effectively remove all BE and obviate the need for long-term surveillance, is another research goal.

We prospectively compared younger (40-64 years) versus older (\u2265 65 years) breast cancer patients' preferences for decision-making roles and their perceived actual roles.A prospective multicenter study was conducted in Leiden, The Hague, and Tilburg over a 2-year period. Early-stage breast cancer patients were surveyed about their preferred and perceived decision-making roles (active, shared, or passive) concerning surgery type (breast-conserving vs. mastectomy) (n = 74), adjuvant chemotherapy (aCT, n = 43), and adjuvant hormonal therapy (aHT, n = 39).For all decisions, both age groups most frequently preferred a shared role before consultation, except for decisions about aHT, for which younger patients more commonly preferred an active role. The proportion of patients favoring an active or passive role in each decision was lower for the older than the younger patients, but none of the differences was significant. Regarding perceived actual roles, both groups most frequently reported an active role in the surgical decision after consultation. In deciding about both aCT and aHT, a larger proportion of older patients perceived having had a passive role compared to younger patients, and a greater proportion of younger patients perceived having been active. Again, differences were not statistically significant.Most older patients preferred to decide together with their clinician, but preferences varied widely. Older patients more often than younger patients perceived they had not been involved in decisions about systemic therapy.

{"title":"Current treatment trends and the need for better predictive tools in the management of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast","abstract":"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast represents a group of heterogeneous non-invasive lesions the incidence of which has risen dramatically since the advent of mammography screening. In this review we summarise current treatment trends and up-to-date results from clinical trials studying surgery and adjuvant therapy alternatives, including the recent consensus on excision margin width and its role in decision-making for post-excision radiotherapy. The main challenge in the clinical management of DCIS continues to be the tailoring of treatment to individual risk, in order to avoid the over-treatment of low-risk lesions or under-treatment of DCIS with higher risk of recurring or progressing into invasion. While studies estimate that only about 40% of DCIS would become invasive if untreated, heterogeneity and complex natural history have prevented adequate identification of these higher-risk lesions. Here we discuss attempts to develop prognostic tools for the risk stratification of DCIS lesions and their limitations. Early results of a UK-wide audit of DCIS management (the Sloane Project) have also demonstrated a lack of consistency in treatment. In this review we offer up-to-date perspectives on current treatment and prediction of DCIS, highlighting the pressing clinical need for better prognostic indices. Tools integrating both clinical and histopathological factors together with molecular biomarkers may hold potential for adequate stratification of DCIS according to risk. This could help develop standardised practices for optimal management of patients with DCIS, improving clinical outcomes while providing only the amount of therapy required for each individual patient.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.pure.ed.ac.uk\/ws\/files\/34747842\/andy_sims_aam.pdf"},"label_included":0}

{"title":"Patient\u2010hematologist discordance in perceived chance of cure in hematologic malignancies: A multicenter study","abstract":"Ensuring that patients with hematologic malignancies have an accurate understanding of their likelihood of cure is important for informed decision making. In a multicenter, longitudinal study, the authors examined discordance in patients' perception of their chance of cure versus that of their hematologists, whether patient-hematologist discordance changed after a consultation with a hematologist, and factors associated with persistent discordance.Before and after consultation with a hematologist, patients were asked about their perceived chance of cure (options were <10%, 10%-19%, and up to 90%-100% in 10% increments, and \"do not wish to answer\"). Hematologists were asked the same question after consultation. Discordance was defined as a difference in response by 2 levels. The McNemar test was used to compare changes in patient-hematologist prognostic discordance from before to after consultation. A generalized linear mixed model was used to examine associations between factors and postconsultation discordance, adjusting for clustering at the hematologist level.A total of 209 patients and 46 hematologists from 4 sites were included in the current study. Before consultation, approximately 61% of dyads were discordant, which improved to 50% after consultation (P < .01). On multivariate analysis, lower educational level (<college vs postgraduate: odds ratio [OR], 2.24; 95% CI, 1.02-4.92), higher social support-affection subscale score (1-unit change in score: OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.00-1.32), and discordance before consultation (OR, 6.17; 95% CI, 2.99-12.72) were found to be significantly associated with discordance after consultation.Patient-hematologist concordance in prognostic understanding appears to improve after a hematology consultation, but approximately one-half of patients' views of their prognoses were found to remain discordant with those of their hematologists. Interventions are needed to improve prognostic understanding among patients with hematologic malignancies.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1002\/cncr.32656"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Experiences of Patients Undergoing Bowel Preparation and Colonoscopy: A Qualitative Longitudinal Study","abstract":"Colonoscopy remains the reference standard for diagnosing and monitoring colorectal cancer and for diagnosis and surveillance of inflammatory bowel disease. However, there is a limited knowledge of the patients' needs when undergoing colonoscopy and the challenges within in order to reduce the number of cancelled colonoscopies. The purpose of the study was to explore the experiences of undergoing bowel preparation and colonoscopy.The study was designed as a qualitative longitudinal interview study with an inductive research approach. Patients were considered for inclusion consecutively and selected based on the following criteria of variation: way of referral for colonoscopy (outpatient or screening), age and gender. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis, and results reported according to COREQ guidelines.Based on the findings, three categories emerged: To weigh up participation, A greater challenge than expected, and Not so challenging after all. Throughout these categories, the experience of uncertainty was reported.The process of undergoing bowel preparation and colonoscopy was influenced by uncertainty due to insufficient information. There is a need to strengthen the patient-centered care by adjusting the information to patient's needs to better support them in decision-making for participation, to better prepare them for the bowel preparation and to better prepare them for the procedure. In addition, it is vital that patients are provided with results of the colonoscopy that correspond to the timeframe specified in written information.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=66470"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"PSA-based prostate cancer screening: the role of active surveillance and informed and shared decision making","abstract":"Since the first publication describing the identification of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the 1960s, much progress has been made. The PSA test changed from being initially a monitoring tool to being also used as a diagnostic tool. Over time, the test has been heavily debated due to its lack of sensitivity and specificity. However, up to now the PSA test is still the only biomarker for the detection and monitoring of prostate cancer. PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is associated with a high proportion of unnecessary testing and overdiagnosis with subsequent overtreatment. In the early years of screening for prostate cancer, high rates of uptake were very important. However, over time the opinion on PSA-based screening has shifted towards the notion of informed choice. Nowadays, it is thought to be unethical to screen men without them being aware of the pros and cons of PSA testing, as well as the fact that an informed choice is related to better patient outcomes. Now, as the results of three major screening studies have been presented and the downsides of screening are becoming better understood, informed choice is becoming more relevant.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"http:\/\/www.asiaandro.com\/news\/upload\/20130930-aja2010180a.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Application of the rapid ethical assessment approach to enhance the ethical conduct of longitudinal population based female cancer research in an urban setting in Ethiopia","abstract":"Rapid Ethical Assessment (REA) is an approach used to design context tailored consent process for voluntary participation of participants in research including human subjects. There is, however, limited evidence on the design of ethical assessment in studies targeting cancer patients in Ethiopia. REA was conducted to explore factors that influence the informed consent process among female cancer patients recruited for longitudinal research from Addis Ababa Population-based Cancer Registry.Qualitative study employing rapid ethnographic approach was conducted from May-July, 2017, at the Tikur Anbessa Specialized Referral Hospital. In-depth and key informants' interviews were conducted among purposively selected 16 participants. Regular de-briefings among the study team helped to identify emerging themes and ensure saturation. Interviews and debriefings were tape recorded in Amharic, and transcribed and translated to English. Coding of the transcripts was facilitated by use of NVivo software. Thematic analysis was employed to respond to the initial questions and interpret findings.Perceived barriers to voluntary study participation included lack of reporting back study results of previous studies, the decision making status of women, hopelessness or fatigue in the patients, shyness of the women, data collectors approach to the patient, and patient's time constraints. Most of the patients preferred oral over written consent and face-to-face interview over telephone interview. Provision of detail information about the study, using short and understandable tool, competent, compassionate and respectful enumerators of the same gender were suggested to assure participation. Due to the perceived severity, the use of the term \"cancer\" was associated with fear and anxiety. Alternatively, uses of phrases like \"breast or cervical illness\/disease\" were suggested during patient interviews.Voluntary participation is not straight forward but affected by different factors. Using competent, compassionate and respectful enumerators, short and precise questioning tools to limit the time of the interview could improve voluntary participation. Moreover, careful consideration of the patients and families concept of the disease such as wording and information has to be taken into account. This assessment helped in improving the consent process of the ongoing project on breast and cervical cancer patients.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12910-018-0328-8"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Evaluating the effectiveness of GP endorsement on increasing participation in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in England: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","abstract":"BackgroundThe success and cost-effectiveness of bowel cancer screening depends on achieving and maintaining high screening uptake rates. The involvement of GPs in screening has been found to improve patient compliance. Therefore, the endorsement of screening by GPs may increase uptake rates amongst non-responders.Methods\/DesignA two-armed randomised controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a GP endorsed reminder in improving patient participation in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NHSBCSP). Up to 30 general practices in the West Midlands with a screening uptake rate of less than 50% will be recruited and patients identified from the patient lists of these practices. Eligible patients will be those aged 60 to 74, who have previously been invited to participate in bowel screening but who have been recorded by the Midlands and North West Bowel Cancer Screening Hub as non-responders. Approximately 4,380 people will be randomised in equal numbers to either the intervention (GP letter and duplicate FOBt kit) or control (no additional contact) arms of the trial.The primary outcome measure will be the difference in the uptake rate of FOBt screening for bowel cancer between the intervention and control groups at 13 weeks after the GP endorsed reminder and duplicate FOBt kit are sent. Secondary outcome measures will be subgroup analyses of uptake according to gender, age and deprivation quartile, and the validation of methods for collecting GP, NHSBCSP and patient costs associated with the intervention. Qualitative work (30 to 40 semi-structured interviews) will be undertaken with individuals in the intervention arm who return a FOBt kit, to investigate the relative importance of the duplicate FOBt kit, reminder to participate, and GP endorsement of that reminder in contributing to individuals' decisions to participate in screening.DiscussionImplementing feasible, acceptable and cost-effective strategies to improve screening uptake amongst non-responders to invitations to participate is fundamentally important for the success of screening programmes.

{"title":"Patients\u2019 and parents\u2019 views regarding supportive care in childhood cancer","abstract":"Intensive therapies in pediatric malignancies increased survival rates but also occurrence of treatment-related morbidities. Therefore, supportive care fulfills an increasingly important role. In planning development of guidelines with incorporation of shared decision making, we noticed that little is known about the needs and preferences of patients and their parents. Our goals were therefore to investigate (1) which supportive care topics patients and parents regard as most important and (2) the preferred role they wish to fulfill in decision making.This qualitative study consisted of three focus groups (two traditional, one online) with patients and parents of two Dutch pediatric oncology centers. Data were transcribed as simple verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.Eleven adolescent patients and 18 parents shared detailed views on various aspects of supportive care. Themes of major importance were communication between patient and physician (commitment, accessibility, proactive attitude of physicians), well-timed provision of information, and the suitability and accessibility of psychosocial care. In contrast to prioritized supportive care topics by medical professionals, somatic issues (e.g., febrile neutropenia) were infrequently addressed. Patients and parents preferred to be actively involved in decision making in selected topics, such as choice of analgesics and anti-emetics, but not in, e.g., choice of antibiotics.Children with cancer and parents were provided a valuable insight into their views regarding supportive care and shared decision making. These results have important implications towards improving supportive care, both in selecting topics for guideline development and incorporating preferences of patients and parents herein.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00520-017-3723-7.pdf"},"label_included":0}

Research has, however, reported wide differences in individuals' desires to be involved in the decision-making process, and these differences in preferences are likely to be the result of a number of factors including age, education and numeracy.To investigate whether patients at genetic risk for cancer had preferences for shared decision making that differed depending on medical domain (general health vs. cancer) and whether decision preferences are linked to numeracy abilities.Four hundred and seventy-six women who consented to participate in response to an email sent by a local branch of the U.S.-based Cancer Genetics Network (CGN) to its members. Participants completed the Control Preference Scale, as well as an objective and subjective numeracy scales.Decision domain (cancer vs. general health) was not associated with women's preferences for involvement in decision making. Objective and subjective numeracy predicted a preference for decision involvement in general, and only objective numeracy was predictive with regard to cancer.Participants were equally likely to state they wanted to play an active, collaborative or passive role in both medical domains (general and cancer). High-numeracy participants were more likely to express a desire for an active role in general and in case they were diagnosed with cancer.Health authorities' recommendations to clinicians to include patients in their medical decisions are supported by patients' desires, and clinicians should be cognizant of their patients' preferences as well as their numeracy skills.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1111\/hex.12257"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Patient-Reported Roles, Preferences, and Expectations Regarding Treatment of Stage I Rectal Cancer in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium","abstract":"Background Historically, stage I rectal cancer was treated with total mesorectal excision. However, there has been growing use of local excision, with and without adjuvant therapy, to treat these early rectal cancers. Little is known about how patients and providers choose among the various treatment approaches. Objective The purpose of this study was to identify patient roles, preferences, and expectations as they relate to treatment decision making for patients with stage I rectal cancer. Design This is a population-based study. Settings The study included a geographically diverse population and health-system-based cohort. Patients A total of 154 adults with newly diagnosed and surgically treated stage I rectal cancer between 2003 and 2005 were included. Main outcome measures We compared patients by surgical treatment groups, including total mesorectal excision and local excision. Clinical, sociodemographic, and health-system factors were assessed for association with patient decision-making preferences and expectations. Results A total of 80% of patients who underwent total mesorectal excision versus 63% of patients who underwent local excision expected that surgery would be curative (p = 0.04). The total mesorectal excision group was less likely to report that radiation would cure their cancer compared with the local excision group (27% vs 63%; p = 0.004). When asked about their preferred role in decision making, 28% of patients who underwent total mesorectal excision preferred patient-controlled decision making compared with 48% of patients who underwent local excision (p = 0.046). However, with regard to the treatment actually received, 38% of the total mesorectal excision group reported making their own surgical decision compared with 25% of the local excision group (p = 0.18). Limitations The study was limited by its sample size. Conclusions The preferred decision-making role for patients did not match the actual decision-making process. Future efforts should focus on bridging the gap between the decision-making process and patient preferences regarding various treatment approaches. This will be particularly important as newer innovative procedures play a more prominent role in the rectal cancer treatment paradigm.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc5015654?pdf=render"},"label_included":1}

Clinical communication about FC and fertility preservation options are suboptimal, increasing patient distress. The purpose of this study is to construct a conceptual model of FC among AYAs with cancer to inform future measurement development. Methods Concept elicitation interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of stakeholders: 36 AYAs (10 adolescents, 12 emerging adults, and 14 young adults), 36 AYA oncology health care providers, and 12 content experts in cancer-related infertility. The constant comparative method was used to identify themes and properties that illustrate AYAs' conceptualization and\/or experience of FC. Results Thirteen themes characterized FC among AYAs with cancer, varying by stakeholder group and domain affiliations. Themes were grouped by four domains (e.g., affective, information, coping, and logistical), which organized the conceptual model. Affective experiences were further determined to be an important component within the other three domains. AYAs' fertility and fertility preservation experiences were shaped by communication factors and timing factors including placement along the lifespan\/cancer continuum. Conclusions AYA FC are characterized by uncertainty and confusion that may contribute to future decisional regret or magnify feelings of loss. Results add to previous research by examining individual, relational, and health care factors that fluctuate to inform fertility preservation perceptions and decision-making across the AYA age spectrum. Findings will be used to develop and test new self-report measures of FC among AYAs with cancer and survivors using classic and modern measurement theory approaches.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8363581"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"How are decisions made in cancer care? A qualitative study using participant observation of current practice","abstract":"Objectives Shared decision-making has continuously gained importance over the last years. However, few studies have investigated the current state of shared decision-making implementation in routine cancer care. This study aimed to investigate how treatment decisions are made in routine cancer care and to explore barriers and facilitators to shared decision-making using an observational approach (three independent observers). Furthermore, the study aimed to extend the understanding of current decision-making processes beyond the dyadic physician\u2013patient interaction. Design Cross-sectional qualitative study using participant observation with semistructured field notes, which were analysed using qualitative content analysis as described by Hsieh and Shannon. Setting and participants Field notes from participant observations were collected at n=54 outpatient consultations and during two 1-week-long observations at two inpatient wards in different clinics of one comprehensive cancer centre in Germany. Results Most of the time, either one physician alone or a group of physicians made the treatment decisions. Patients were seldom actively involved. Patients who were \u2018active\u2019 (ie, asked questions, demanded participation, opposed treatment recommendations) facilitated shared decision-making. Time pressure, frequent alternation of responsible physicians and poor coordination of care were the main observed barriers for shared decision-making. We found high variation in decision-making behaviour between different physicians as well as the same physician with different patients. Conclusion Most of the time physicians made the treatment decisions. Shared decision-making was very rarely implemented in current routine cancer care. The entire decision-making process was not observed to follow the principles of shared decision-making. However, some aspects of shared decision-making were occasionally incorporated. Individual as well as organisational factors were found to influence the degree of shared decision-making. If future routine cancer care wishes to follow the principles of shared decision-making, strategies are needed to foster shared decision-making in routine cancer care.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/7\/9\/e016360.full.pdf"},"label_included":0}

However, adding this information might result in complex risk predictions on multiple diseases, unsolicited findings and information on (past) environmental exposure and behaviour. This complicates informed consent procedures and may impede autonomous decision-making. In this article we investigate and identify the specific features of epigenetic risk-stratified cancer screening that challenge the current informed consent doctrine. Subsequently we describe current and new informed consent models and the principle of respect for autonomy and argue for a specific informed consent model for epigenetic risk-stratified screening programmes. Next, we propose a framework that guides the development of Patient Decision Aids (PDAs) to support informed consent and promote autonomous choices in the specific context of epigenetic cancer screening programmes.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2075-4426\/9\/1\/14\/pdf?version=1551256396"},"label_included":0}

Identification of abnormal abdominal lymph nodes is important for clinical, therapeutic, and prognostic decision making. No published study describes the CT appearance of abdominal lymph nodes in healthy cats. Hypothesis\/objectives All abdominal lymph centers will be identified on CT with the majority of lymph nodes being elongated and homogenously contrast enhancing. Animals Sixteen healthy cats without clinical or biochemical evidence of disease. Methods Precontrast and postcontrast CT images of sedated healthy cats were used to identify the presence and descriptive characteristics of intra-abdominal lymph nodes. These assessments then were compared with patient characteristics to identify possible correlations. Results Abdominal lymph nodes were readily identified on CT with caudal mesenteric, colic, hepatic, inguinal, and pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes identified in 16\/16 cats. Lymph node size and shape varied among lymph centers with nearly all lymph nodes homogeneously contrast enhancing in 515\/525. Significant negative correlations were identified between age and length (P = .0166) and width (P = .0387) of abdominal lymph nodes as well as age and number of sacral lymph nodes (P = .0493). Intranodal fat was present in 18\/525 lymph nodes. Conclusions and clinical importance CT readily permitted identification and characterization of feline abdominal lymph nodes. This study provides subjective and objective data on the CT characteristics of abdominal lymph nodes in 16 healthy cats, with younger cats having larger abdominal lymph nodes and a higher number of sacral lymph nodes.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/jvim.15088"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Oncologists\u2019 Views on Using Value to Guide Cancer Treatment Decisions","abstract":"Cancer costs have increased substantially in the past decades, prompting specialty societies to urge oncologists to consider value in clinical decision making. Despite oncologists' crucial role in guiding cancer care, current literature is sparse with respect to the oncologists' views on value. Here, we evaluated oncologists perceptions of the use and measurement of value in cancer care.We conducted in-depth, open-ended interviews with 31 US oncologists practicing nationwide in various environments. Oncologists discussed the definition, measurement, and implementation of value. Transcripts were analyzed using matrix and thematic analysis.Oncologists' definitions of value varied greatly. Some described versions of the standard health economic definition of value, that is, cost relative to health outcomes. Many others did not include cost in their definition of value. Oncologists considered patient goals and quality of life as important components of value that they perceived were missing from current value measurement. Oncologists prioritized a patient-centric view of value over societal or other perspectives. Oncologists were inclined to consider the value of a treatment only if they perceived treatment would pose a financial burden to patients. Oncologists had differing opinions regarding who should be responsible for determining whether care is low value but generally felt this should remain within the purview of the oncology community.Oncologists agreed that cost was an important issue, but disagreed about whether cost was involved in value as well as the role of value in guiding treatment. Better clarity and alignment on the definition of and appropriate way to measure value is critical to the success of efforts to improve value in cancer care.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"http:\/\/www.valueinhealthjournal.com\/article\/S1098301518301864\/pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Decision-making in patients with advanced cancer compared with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","abstract":"Patients with advanced cancer need information about end-of-life treatment options in order to make informed decisions. Clinicians vary in the frequency with which they initiate these discussions.As part of a long-term longitudinal study, patients with an expected 2-year survival of less than 50% who had advanced gastrointestinal or lung cancer or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were interviewed. Each patient's medical record was reviewed at enrollment and at 3 months for evidence of the discussion of patient wishes concerning ventilator support, artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH), resuscitation (DNR) and hospice care. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was also performed and 2-year survival calculated.60 cancer and 32 ALS patients were enrolled. ALS patients were more likely than cancer patients to have evidence of discussion about their wishes for ventilator support (31% vs 0%, p<0.001), ANH (38% vs 0%, p<0.001), DNR (25% vs 0%, p<0.001) and hospice care (22% vs 5%, p = 0.03). At 6 months, 91% of ALS patients were alive compared with 62% of cancer patients; at 2 years, 63% of ALS patients were alive compared with 23% of cancer patients (p<0.001).Cancer patients were less likely than ALS patients to have had documented advanced care planning discussions despite worse survival. This may reflect perceptions that ALS has a more predictable course, that advanced cancer has a greater number of treatment options, or differing views about hope. Nevertheless, cancer patients may be less adequately prepared for end-of-life decision-making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc2572766?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Impact of Adverse Events Associated With Medications in the Treatment and Prevention of Rheumatoid Arthritis","abstract":"Treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over the last few decades have transformed the future outlook of the disease. Although patients with clinically apparent RA have a number of therapeutic options, all are associated with the risk of adverse events (AEs). Such therapeutics, facilitated by the identification of novel biomarkers and environmental and genetic factors to predict RA, may allow early detection, prompt treatment, and prevention before the future development of clinically apparent disease. Before choosing such treatments to make informed decisions in this context, however, accurate quantification of benefits and harms of such treatments is vital for participants without symptoms. This review summarizes the AEs reported in trials in preclinical or very early RA, the frequency and risk of primary AEs of concern associated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (conventional, biologic, and targeted), glucocorticoids, and analgesia in clinically apparent RA. Also summarized is the evidence to date to support the quantification of benefit and harms incorporating patient preferences.This analysis is a narrative review in which individual searches were performed in PubMed and EMBASE for each drug and topic outlined in the review.Current therapies in RA can result in a considerable burden of AEs (serious and nonserious) depending on the individual's baseline risk. The absolute risk of serious AEs to treatments reported in individuals at risk of RA, undifferentiated, or very early inflammatory arthritis trials was low; however, nonserious AEs were not consistently reported. If such therapies prove effective at preventing the onset of RA in high-risk patients, incorporating patient preferences as well as robust quantification of benefits and harms to inform decisions is imperative. Patients' perceptions about treatment in this context may be risk averse or benefit driven. The risk of AEs that may not reverse after drug cessation, such as serious infection and malignancy, seem to be important AEs in such decision-making.The impact of AEs in response to potentially preventative treatment is an important consideration for individuals at high risk of developing RA with minimal symptoms. Robust quantification of treatment effect given baseline risk versus the risks of developing all AEs (including those that may affect quality of life), while incorporating participants' views, will be necessary for future informed decision-making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/pure.manchester.ac.uk\/ws\/files\/88539852\/Clin_Ther_revision_R1_clean.docx"},"label_included":0}

Their communicative styles had one of two implications: conveying options without offering specific recommendations, or recommending one without incorporating patients' goals and values into the decision. Some physicians, however, used techniques that encouraged patient participation.Broadcasting may be a suboptimal method of conveying complex treatment information in order to support shared decision-making. Interventions could teach techniques that encourage patient participation.Techniques such as open-ended questions, affirmations of patients' expressions, and pauses to check for patient understanding can mitigate the effects of broadcasting and could be used to promote shared decision-making in information-dense subspecialist consultations.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/dash.harvard.edu\/bitstream\/1\/34451367\/1\/nihms523029.pdf"},"label_included":0}

{"title":"Meeting the Decision-Making Preferences of Patients With Breast Cancer in Oncology Consultations: Impact on Decision-Related Outcomes","abstract":"Purpose To investigate how involvement preferences of patients with breast cancer change during the treatment decision-making process and determine the impact of meeting patients' expectations on decision-making outcomes. Patients and Methods Participants were 683 patients with breast cancer from 62 oncologists in five different countries recruited to an International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG 33-03) project. Questionnaires elicited patients' pre- and postconsultation preferences for involvement in treatment decision making and whether these were met or not. Decision-related outcomes were assessed postconsultation. Results Before the consultation, most patients preferred shared or patient-directed treatment decision making. After the consultation, 43% of patients' preferences changed, and most shifted toward patient-directed decisions. The actual postconsultation decision was more likely to be made according to postconsultation rather than preconsultation preferences. Compared with patients who were less involved than they had hoped to be, patients who were as involved as they had hoped to be or were even more involved in decision making had significantly better decision-related outcomes. This was true regardless of whether preference change occurred. Conclusion Many patients with early-stage breast cancer have treatment options and approach treatment decisions with a desire for decisional control, which may increase after their consultation. Patients' ultimate involvement preferences were more likely to be consistent with the way the decision was actually made, suggesting that patients need to feel concordance between their preference and the actual decision. Patients who directed decisions, even if more than they hoped for, fared better on all decision-related outcomes. These results emphasize the need for oncologists to endorse and facilitate patient participation in treatment decision making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/ascopubs.org\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1200\/JCO.2011.37.7952?role=tab"},"label_included":1}

The goal of this conference was to develop an expert consensus-driven working framework for comprehensive genetic evaluation of inherited PCA in the multigene testing era addressing genetic counseling, testing, and genetically informed management. Methods An expert consensus conference was convened including key stakeholders to address genetic counseling and testing, PCA screening, and management informed by evidence review. Results Consensus was strong that patients should engage in shared decision making for genetic testing. There was strong consensus to test HOXB13 for suspected hereditary PCA, BRCA1\/2 for suspected hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, and DNA mismatch repair genes for suspected Lynch syndrome. There was strong consensus to factor BRCA2 mutations into PCA screening discussions. BRCA2 achieved moderate consensus for factoring into early-stage management discussion, with stronger consensus in high-risk\/advanced and metastatic setting. Agreement was moderate to test all men with metastatic castration-resistant PCA, regardless of family history, with stronger agreement to test BRCA1\/2 and moderate agreement to test ATM to inform prognosis and targeted therapy. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive, multidisciplinary consensus statement to address a genetic evaluation framework for inherited PCA in the multigene testing era. Future research should focus on developing a working definition of familial PCA for clinical genetic testing, expanding understanding of genetic contribution to aggressive PCA, exploring clinical use of genetic testing for PCA management, genetic testing of African American males, and addressing the value framework of genetic evaluation and testing men at risk for PCA\u2014a clinically heterogeneous disease.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc6075860?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Insights into the theranostic value of precision medicine on advanced radiotherapy to breast cancer","abstract":"is the most common in women worldwide. Breast cancer encompasses a broad spectrum of diseases (i.e., subtypes) with significant epidemiological, clinical, and biological heterogeneity. Each of these subtypes has a different natural history and prognostic profile. Although tumour staging (TNM classification) still provides valuable information in the overall management of breast cancer, the current reality is that clinicians must consider other biological and molecular factors that directly influence treatment decision-making, including extent of surgery, indication for chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and even radiotherapy (and treatment volumes). The management of breast has changed radically in the last 15 years due to significant advances in our understanding of these tumours. While these changes have been extremely positive in terms of surgical and systemic management, they have also created significant uncertainties concerning integration of local and locoregional radiotherapy into the therapeutic scheme. In parallel, radiotherapy itself has also experienced major advances. Beyond the evident technological advances, new radiobiological concepts have emerged, and genomic data and other patient-specific factors must now be integrated into individualized treatment approaches. In this context, seeks to provide an answer to these open questions and uncertainties. Although precision medicine has been much discussed in the last five years or so, the concept remains somewhat ambiguous, and it often appear to be used as a catch-all term. The present review aims to clarify the meaning of this term and, more importantly, to critically evaluate the role and impact of precision medicine on breast radiotherapy. Finally, we will discuss the current and future of precision medicine in radiotherapy.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.medsci.org\/v18p0626.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Expertise, advocacy and activism: A qualitative study on the activities of prostate cancer peer support workers","abstract":"Peer support workers are now working with patients in a variety of settings, coming into close contact and even work alongside health professionals. Despite the potentially influential position peer support workers hold in relation to those engaged in support activities, their role, duties and their relationship to peers and health professionals lack clarity and is often defined by other actors. This study explores how peer support workers interpret and define the activities, responsibilities and knowledge associated with their work. Using methods of membership categorisation analysis, we analysed interview materials generated by conducting individual semi-structured interviews during the autumn of 2016 with prostate cancer peer support workers ( n = 11) who currently volunteer as support workers in Finland. Although the peer support workers acknowledged the psychosocial aspects of the work, we argue that their interpretations extend far beyond this and encompass expertise, advocacy and activism as central features of their work. These can be used to strengthen their position as credible commentators and educators on issues relating to cancer and men\u2019s health; raise awareness and represent the \u2018patient\u2019s voice\u2019 and attempt to influence both policy and clinical practice. These findings suggest that by categorising their work activities in different ways, voluntary sector actors such as peer support workers can attempt to portray themselves as legitimate authorities on a range of issues and influence decision-making ranging from individual level treatment decisions all the way to health policy.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10138\/308514"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"DNA methylation alterations in grade II- and anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma","abstract":"Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a rare WHO grade II tumor accounting for less than 1% of all astrocytomas. Malignant transformation into PXA with anaplastic features, is unusual and correlates with poorer outcome of the patients.Using a DNA methylation custom array, we have quantified the DNA methylation level on the promoter sequence of 807 cancer-related genes of WHO grade II (n = 11) and III PXA (n = 2) and compared to normal brain tissue (n = 10) and glioblastoma (n = 87) samples. DNA methylation levels were further confirmed on independent samples by pyrosequencing of the promoter sequences.Increasing DNA promoter hypermethylation events were observed in anaplastic PXA as compared with grade II samples. We further validated differential hypermethylation of CD81, HCK, HOXA5, ASCL2 and TES on anaplastic PXA and grade II tumors. Moreover, these epigenetic alterations overlap those described in glioblastoma patients, suggesting common mechanisms of tumorigenesis.Even taking into consideration the small size of our patient populations, our data strongly suggest that epigenome-wide profiling of PXA is a valuable tool to identify methylated genes, which may play a role in the malignant progression of PXA. These methylation alterations may provide useful biomarkers for decision-making in those patients with low-grade PXA displaying a high risk of malignant transformation.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2407-14-213"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Patient\u2013oncologist communication in advanced cancer: predictors of patient perception of prognosis","abstract":"Advanced cancer patients' perceptions of prognosis, which are often overly optimistic compared to oncologist estimates, influence treatment preferences. The predictors of patients' perceptions and the effect of oncologist communication on patient understanding are unclear. This study was designed to identify the communication factors that influence patient-oncologist concordance about chance of cure.We analyzed audiorecorded encounters between 51 oncologists and 141 advanced cancer patients with good (n = 69) or poor (n = 72) concordance about chance of cure. Encounters were coded for communication factors that might influence oncologist-patient concordance, including oncologist statements of optimism and pessimism.Oncologists made more statements of optimism (mean = 3.3 per encounter) than statements of pessimism (mean = 1.2 per encounter). When oncologists made at least one statement of pessimism, patients were more likely to agree with their oncologist's estimated chance of cure (OR = 2.59, 95%CI = 1.31-5.12). Statements of optimism and uncertainty were not associated with an increased likelihood that patients would agree or disagree with their oncologists about chance of cure.Communication of pessimistic information to patients with advanced cancer increases the likelihood that patients will report concordant prognostic estimates. Communication of optimistic information does not have any direct effect. The best communication strategy to maximize patient knowledge for informed decision making while remaining sensitive to patients' emotional needs may be to emphasize optimistic aspects of prognosis while also consciously and clearly communicating pessimistic aspects of prognosis.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc2864029?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Describing care coordination of gynecologic oncology in western healthcare settings: a rapid review","abstract":"Caring for women with gynecologic malignancies requires multidisciplinary communication and coordination across multiple providers. This article discusses a rapid review of the literature on characteristics of care coordination for gynecologic malignancies. Five electronic databases (from inception through March 2015) were searched for empirical studies on coordinated care models for female adults with gynecologic malignancies. A single reviewer extracted and synthesized information on how care was coordinated, how care teams made decisions, who performed what tasks, how care teams communicated information to coordinate care, and potential impact of the characteristic on delivering coordinated care. From 26 included studies, predominant characteristics of coordinated care were identified: multidisciplinary teams, patient navigators, scheduled follow-ups, survivorship care plans, and colocated services. Decision-making was best documented for studies that utilized teams that had periodic scheduled meetings with set agendas and consistent procedures. Providers' roles in coordinating care were numerous, reflecting professional backgrounds: oncologists had most authority in making treatment decisions; radiologists and pathologists shared vital biomedical information; and nurses coordinated care and communicated with patients. Communication tools and strategies across studies included having shared medical records, integrated treatment plans, and telephone-based or teleconferencing communication. There was limited information available on the impact of characteristics and accompanying strategies or tools. Several characteristics of care coordination models for gynecologic cancers have been published in the literature. Further investigation is needed to understand the relative effectiveness of these ways to coordinate care.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/4653750"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"HCC advances in diagnosis and prognosis: Digital and Imaging","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Understanding of the pathogenesis of HCC has significantly improved in the past few years due to advances in genetics, molecular biology and pathology. Several subtypes have been identified with different backgrounds and outcomes, leading to possible changes in disease management and challenging the role of imaging. Indeed, despite its pivotal role in the diagnostic workup, prognosis, and the decision-making process in patients with HCC, these recent developments are progressively redefining the role of imaging. First and most important, liver imaging is shifting from a purely qualitative to a quantitative paradigm, integrating quantitative imaging and radiomics in a digital era. Second, to improve patient management, imaging has gradually moved beyond tumor-centered assessment to include a broader evaluation of the liver and its function. This review describes and discusses these advances in the imaging for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1111\/liv.14865"},"label_included":0}

The impact of demographic and psychosocial characteristics on the decisional role of patients is also examined.Patients with relapsed non-small cell lung cancer who were candidates for a phase II trial of erlotinib monotherapy were recruited. Patients were interviewed after they had learned of their relapse and the treatment decision had been made but before pharmacologic intervention.Most of the 28 participants were married, had a smoking history, and were well educated. They reported moderate levels of depression and anxiety. Initially, 14% of the patients reported a preference for active decision making; later, 29% believed that the primary responsibility for the treatment decision had been theirs. Only 54% of the patients agreed with the physician's assessment of how the treatment decision was made (\u03ba = 0.31; test of symmetry, p = 0.23). The depression score was significantly associated with a patient's preferred level of control (p < 0.01).The limited concordance between patient preference and perception and between patient and physician perceptions regarding how the treatment decision was made suggests that physicians should more accurately identify patient preferences by directly asking patients at the beginning of each clinical encounter.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"http:\/\/www.jto.org\/article\/S1556086415318189\/pdf"},"label_included":1}

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis provides possibilities for molecular tumor profiling. In this study, we aim to explore the additional value of centralized ctDNA profiling next to current standard-of-care protocolled tissue-based molecular profiling (SoC-TMP) in the primary diagnostic setting of mNSCLC in the Netherlands. METHODS Pretreatment plasma samples from 209 patients with confirmed mNSCLC were analyzed retrospectively using the NGS AVENIO ctDNA Targeted Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and compared with paired prospective pretreatment tissue-based molecular profiling from patient records. The AVENIO panel is designed to detect single-nucleotide variants, copy-number variations, insertions or deletions, and tyrosine kinase fusion in 17 genes. RESULTS Potentially targetable drivers were detected with SoC-TMP alone in 34.4% of patients. Addition of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential\u2013corrected, plasma-based CMP increased this to 39.7% ( P &lt; .001). Concordance between SoC-TMP and plasma-CMP was 86.6% for potentially targetable drivers. Clinical sensitivity of plasma-CMP was 75.2% for any oncogenic driver. Specificity and positive predictive value were more than 90% for all oncogenic drivers. CONCLUSION Plasma-CMP is a reliable tool in the primary diagnostic setting, although it cannot fully replace SoC-TMP. Complementary profiling by combined SoC-TMP and plasma-CMP increased the proportion of patients who are eligible for targeted treatment.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","oa_url":"https:\/\/ascopubs.org\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1200\/PO.20.00450"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"It's all in the name: Does nomenclature for indolent prostate cancer impact management and anxiety?","abstract":"Despite consensus guidelines, many men with low-grade prostate cancer are not managed with active surveillance. Patient perception of the nomenclature used to describe low-grade prostate cancers may partly explain this discrepancy.A randomized online survey was administered to men without a history of prostate cancer, presenting a hypothetical clinical scenario in which they are given a new diagnosis of low-grade prostate cancer. The authors determined whether diagnosis nomenclature was associated with management preference and diagnosis-related anxiety using ratings given on a scale from 1 to 100, adjusting for participant characteristics through multivariable linear regression.The survey was completed by 718 men. Compared with Gleason 6 out of 10 prostate cancer, the term grade group 1 out of 5 prostate cancer was associated with lower preference for immediate treatment versus active surveillance (\u03b2 = -9.3; 95% CI, -14.4, -4.2; P < .001), lower diagnosis-related anxiety (\u03b2 = -8.3; 95% CI, -12.8, -3.8; P < .001), and lower perceived disease severity (\u03b2 = -12.3; 95% CI, -16.5, -8.1; P < .001) at the time of initial diagnosis. Differences decreased as participants received more disease-specific education. Indolent lesion of epithelial origin, a suggested alternative term for indolent tumors, was not associated with differences in anxiety or preference for active surveillance.Within a hypothetical clinical scenario, nomenclature for low-grade prostate cancer affects initial perception of the disease and may alter subsequent decision making, including preference for active surveillance. Disease-specific education reduces the differential impact of nomenclature use, reaffirming the importance of comprehensive counseling and clear communication between the clinician and patient.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8722476"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Effect of a Skills Training for Oncologists and a Patient Communication Aid on Shared Decision Making About Palliative Systemic Treatment: A Randomized Clinical Trial","abstract":"Abstract Background Palliative systematic treatment offers uncertain and often limited benefits, and the burden can be high. Hence, treatment decisions require shared decision making (SDM). This trial examined the independent and combined effect of an oncologist training and a patient communication aid on SDM. Methods In this multicenter randomized controlled trial with four parallel arms (2016\u20132018), oncologists (n = 31) were randomized to receive SDM communication skills training or not. The training consisted of a reader, two group sessions, a booster session, and a consultation room tool (10 hours). Patients (n = 194) with advanced cancer were randomized to receive a patient communication aid or not. The aid consisted of education on SDM, a question prompt list, and a value clarification exercise. The primary outcome was observed SDM as rated by blinded observers from audio-recorded consultations. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported SDM, patient and oncologist satisfaction, patients\u2019 decisional conflict, patient quality of life 3 months after consultation, consultation duration, and the decision made. Results The oncologist training had a large positive effect on observed SDM (Cohen's d = 1.12) and on patient-reported SDM (d = 0.73). The patient communication aid did not improve SDM. The combination of interventions did not add to the effect of training oncologists only. The interventions affected neither patient nor oncologist satisfaction with the consultation nor patients\u2019 decisional conflict, quality of life, consultation duration, or the decision made. Conclusion Training medical oncologists in SDM about palliative systemic treatment improves both observed and patient-reported SDM. A patient communication aid does not. The incorporation of skills training in (continuing) educational programs for medical oncologists is likely to stimulate the widely advocated uptake of shared decision making in clinical practice.

{"title":"What matters most: protocol for a randomized controlled trial of breast cancer surgery encounter decision aids across socioeconomic strata","abstract":"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women. Mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery (BCS) have equivalent survival for early stage breast cancer. However, each surgery has different benefits and harms that women may value differently. Women of lower socioeconomic status (SES) diagnosed with early stage breast cancer are more likely to experience poorer doctor-patient communication, lower satisfaction with surgery and decision-making, and higher decision regret compared to women of higher SES. They often play a more passive role in decision-making and are less likely to undergo BCS. Our aim is to understand how best to support women of lower SES in making decisions about early stage breast cancer treatments and to reduce disparities in decision quality across socioeconomic strata.We will conduct a three-arm, multi-site randomized controlled superiority trial with stratification by SES and clinician-level randomization. At four large cancer centers in the United States, 1100 patients (half higher SES and half lower SES) will be randomized to: (1) Option Grid, (2) Picture Option Grid, or (3) usual care. Interviews, field-notes, and observations will be used to explore strategies that promote the interventions' sustained use and dissemination. Community-Based Participatory Research will be used throughout. We will include women aged at least 18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of early stage breast cancer (I to IIIA) from both higher and lower SES, provided they speak English, Spanish, or Mandarin Chinese. Our primary outcome measure is the 16-item validated Decision Quality Instrument. We will use a regression framework, mediation analyses, and multiple informants analysis. Heterogeneity of treatment effects analyses for SES, age, ethnicity, race, literacy, language, and study site will be performed.Currently, women of lower SES are more likely to make treatment decisions based on incomplete or uninformed preferences, potentially leading to poorer decision quality, quality of life, and decision regret.

Patients provided with a choice of breast cancer surgery (breast conservation therapy (BCT) or mastectomy) were purposively recruited from high, medium and low case-mix-adjusted mastectomy rate units.Results:Low mastectomy rate unit patients\u2019 consultation and decision-making experiences were markedly different to those of the medium and high mastectomy rate breast units. Treatment variation was associated with patients\u2019 perception of the most reassuring and least disruptive treatment; the content and style of information provision (equipoise or directed); level of patient participation in decision making; the time and process of decision making and patient autonomy in decision making. The provision of more comprehensive less directive information and greater autonomy, time and support of independent decision making were associated with a lower uptake of BCT.Conclusion:Variation in hospital mastectomy rates was associated with differences in the consultation and decision-making experiences of breast cancer patients.

{"title":"What Is Important When Making Treatment Decisions in Metastatic Breast Cancer? A Qualitative Analysis of Decision-Making in Patients and Oncologists","abstract":"Abstract Background Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an ideal environment for shared decision-making because of the large number of guideline-based treatment options with similar efficacy but different toxicity profiles. This qualitative analysis describes patient and provider factors that influence decision-making in treatment of MBC. Materials and Methods Patients and community oncologists completed in-person interviews. Academic medical oncologists participated in focus groups. Interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo. Using an a priori model based on the Ottawa Framework, two independent coders analyzed transcripts using a constant comparative method. Major themes and exemplary quotes were extracted. Results Participants included 20 patients with MBC, 6 community oncologists, and 5 academic oncologists. Analysis of patient interviews revealed a decision-making process characterized by the following themes: decision-making style, contextual factors, and preferences. Patient preference subthemes include treatment efficacy, physical side effects of treatment, emotional side effects of treatment, cognitive side effects of treatment, cost and financial toxicity, salience of cutting-edge treatment options (clinical trial or newly approved medication), treatment logistics and convenience, personal and family responsibilities, treatment impact on daily activities, participation in self-defining endeavors, attending important events, and pursuing important goals. Physician decisions emphasized drug-specific characteristics (treatment efficacy, side effects, cost) rather than patient preferences, which might impact treatment choice. Conclusion Although both patients with MBC and oncologists considered treatment characteristics when making decisions, patients\u2019 considerations were broader than oncologists\u2019, incorporating contextual factors such as the innovative value of the treatment and life responsibilities. Differences in perspectives between patients and oncologists suggests the value of tools to facilitate systematic communication of preferences in the setting of MBC. Implications for Practice Both patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and oncologists emphasized importance of efficacy and physical side effects when making treatment decisions. However, other patient considerations for making treatment decisions were broader, incorporating contextual factors such as the logistics of treatments, personal and family responsibilities, and ability to attend important events. Furthermore, individual patients varied substantially in priorities that they want considered in treatment decisions. Differences in perspectives between patients and oncologists suggest the value of tools to facilitate systematic elicitation of preferences and communication of those preferences to oncologists for integration into decision-making in MBC.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","oa_url":"https:\/\/theoncologist.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1634\/theoncologist.2018-0711"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Skin Cancer Epidemics in the Elderly as An Emerging Issue in Geriatric Oncology","abstract":"Skin cancer is a worldwide, emerging clinical need in the elderly white population, with a steady increase in incidence rates, morbidity and related medical costs. Skin cancer is a heterogeneous group of cancers comprising cutaneous melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), which predominantly affect elderly patients, aged older than 65 years. Melanoma has distinct clinical presentations in the elderly patient and represents a challenging question in terms of clinical management. NMSC includes the basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and presents a wide disease spectrum in the elderly population, ranging from low-risk to high-risk tumours, advanced and inoperable disease. Treatment decisions for NMSC are preferentially based on tumour characteristics, patient's chronological age and physician's preferences and operational settings. Several treatment options are available for NMSC, from surgery to non-invasive\/medical therapies, but patient-based factors, such as geriatric comorbidities and patient's life expectancy, do not frequently modulate treatment goals. In melanoma, age-related variations in clinical management are significant and may frequently lead to under-treatment, limiting access to advanced surgical and medical treatments. Clinical decision-making in the care of elderly skin cancer patient should ideally implement a geriatric assessment, prioritizing patient-based factors and efficiently differentiating fit from frail cancer patients. Current clinical practice guidelines for NMSC and melanoma only partially address geriatric aspects of cancer care, such as frailty, limited life-expectancy, geriatric comorbidities and treatment compliance. We review the recent evidence on the scope and problem of skin cancer in the elderly population as well as age-related variations in its clinical management, highlighting the potential role of a geriatric approach in optimizing dermato-oncological care.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"http:\/\/www.aginganddisease.org\/EN\/article\/downloadArticleFile.do?attachType=PDF&id=147639"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Patient Perceptions of Illness Identity in Cancer Clinical Trial Decision-Making","abstract":"When patients are diagnosed with cancer, they begin to negotiate their illness identity in relation to their past and future selves, their relationships, and their group memberships. Thus, how patients view their cancer in relation to their other identities may affect how and why they make particular decisions about treatment options. Using the Communication Theory of Identity (CTI), the current study explores: (1) how and why illness identity is framed across identity layers in relation to one particular cancer treatment: participation in a cancer clinical trial (CT); and (2) how and why patients experience identity conflicts while making their treatment decisions. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were analyzed for 46 cancer patients who were offered a CT. Results of a grounded theory analysis indicated that patients expressed separate identity frames (e.g., personal, relational, and communal), aligned identity frames (e.g., personal and communal), and identity conflicts (e.g., personal-personal). This study theoretically shows how and why patient illness identity relates to cancer treatment decision-making as well as how and why patients relate (and conflict) with the cancer communal identity frame. Practical implications include how healthcare providers and family members can support patient decision-making through awareness of and accommodating to identity shifts.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc6145173?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}

Patients and methods: Our study enrolled patients from a Canadian ambulatory oncology program who were undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both, for cancer. The adapted Control Preferences Scale was used to survey perceived and preferred roles in decision-making. The study survey also included items from the Decisional Conflict Scale and the Preparation for Decision-Making Scale. Results: Of 192 participants, 98 (51%) perceived that they were offered treatment choices. Of those 98, 47 (48%) thought that the options were presented equally. Compared with the patients not offered choices, those who were given choices were less passive (4% vs. 29%, p &lt; 0.001) and more satisfied (100% vs. 95%, p &lt; 0.03) in decision-making. Participants whose preferred and perceived roles were different would have preferred more involvement in decision-making. To attain the preferred involvement, patients wanted to receive more information on treatment options, to be given a choice, to have more discussion with the health care team, and to have providers better listen to their needs. Conclusions: Only half of surveyed patients thought that they were offered choices for their cancer treatment. When offered choices, patients were more active in decision-making. Further initiatives are required to determine approaches for supporting patients with cancer so that they can be more involved in decision-making.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1718-7729\/17\/4\/527\/pdf"},"label_included":1}
{"title":"The Influence of Patient Identification and Narrative Transportation on Intentions to Participate in Cancer Research","abstract":"Cancer decision-making interventions commonly utilize narratives as a persuasive strategy to increase identification with the message source, promote involvement with the topic, and elicit greater willingness to adopt recommended behaviors. However, there is little empirical research examining the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of this strategy in the context of cancer research participation. Data for the current manuscript were collected as part of a larger study conducted with cancer patients (N = 413) from the USA, UK, and the Republic of Ireland. Participants viewed and evaluated video-recorded vignettes, illustrating different strategies for discussing clinical trials participation with family members. Results showed nationality was a significant predictor of identification with the main character (i.e., patient) in the vignette. Unexpectedly, these cross-national differences in identification disappeared when patients currently undergoing treatment had higher perceived susceptibility of their cancer. Identification with the main character in the vignettes was a significant predictor of intentions to participate in cancer research, but only when the mediating role of narrative transportation was considered. The findings demonstrate the importance of considering how individual and social identities influence identification with characters in cancer narratives and yield practical guidance for developing arts-based interventions to increase cancer research participation.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc7055730?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"The impact of somatic SMAD4 mutations in colorectal liver metastases","abstract":"Recent advances in cancer genomics have led to the identification of many molecular pathways involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) carcinogenesis. Pre-clinical and clinical data have shown that gene mutations involved in several of these pathways have an important prognostic impact, particularly on the outcomes of patients with metastatic CRC. Therefore, specific information on such gene mutational status can be potentially used as biomarkers to guide genome-oriented personalized treatment and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Drosophila protein, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) has a critical intermediate role in the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. Loss of SMAD4 expression is associated with both metastatic development and worse response to chemotherapy for patients with CRC. Additionally, it has been reported that the loss of SMAD4 function is independently associated with decreased recurrencefree (RFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with CRC, especially for patients with advanced stages of disease. Furthermore, among patients who undergo hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), SMAD4 mutations are associated with a high likelihood of simultaneously carrying RAS mutations, which independently predict worse OS. Although recent evidence highlights the prognostic importance of somatic SMAD4 mutations in CRLM, ongoing research is necessary to untangle the specific molecular mechanisms involved in the complex SMAD4 regulatory network as well as the synergism with other mutations implicated in the pathogenesis of CRC.

According to TAVR guidelines, body computed tomography (CT) is recommended for pre-procedural planning. Due to the advanced age of these patients, multiple radiological potentially malignant incidental findings (pmIFs) appear in this cohort. It is unknown how pmIFs influence the decision by the heart team to intervene and the mortality.We evaluated in a retrospective single-centre observational study 414 participants screened for TAVR with dual-source CT between October 2010 and December 2012. pmIFs are common and appeared in 18.7% of all patients screened for TAVR. The decision to intervene by TAVR or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) was made by an interdisciplinary heart team and the role of pmIF in decision-making and time to treatment with TAVR or SAVR was analysed, retrospectively. The appearance of a pmIF vs. no pmIF did not significantly influence therapeutic decisions [odds ratio (OR) 1.14; P = 0.835] or time to treatment (91 \u00b1 152 vs. 61 \u00b1 109 days, respectively). Several findings, which are highly suspicious for malignancy, were less likely associated with invasive treatment (OR 0.207; P = 0.046). Patient survival was evaluated for at least 2 years until January 2014. Two-year survival of patients after TAVR or SAVR, treated according to the heart team decision, was \u223c75% and independent from the presence of a non-severe (P = 0.923) or severe (P = 0.823) pmIF.The study indicates that frequently occurring radiologic pmIF did not influence 2-year survival after a decision to intervene was made by an interdisciplinary heart team.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/articles\/pmc4463004?pdf=render"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Developing a Self-Administered Decision Aid for Fecal Immunochemical Test\u2013Based Colorectal Cancer Screening Tailored to Citizens With Lower Educational Attainment: Qualitative Study","abstract":"Citizens with lower educational attainments (EA) take up colorectal cancer screening to a lesser degree, and more seldom read and understand conventional screening information than citizens with average EAs. The information needs of citizens with lower EA are diverse, however, with preferences ranging from wanting clear recommendations to seeking detailed information about screening. Decision aids have been developed to support citizens with lower EA in making informed decisions about colorectal cancer screening participation, but none embrace diverse information needs.The aim of this study was to develop a self-administered decision aid for participation in fecal immunochemical test-based colorectal cancer screening. The decision aid should be tailored to citizens with lower EA and should embrace diverse information needs.The Web-based decision aid was developed according to an international development framework, with specific steps for designing, alpha testing, peer reviewing, and beta testing the decision aid. In the design phase, a prototype of the decision aid was developed based on previous studies about the information needs of lower EA citizens and the International Patient Decision Aid Standards guidelines. Alpha testing was conducted using focus group interviews and email correspondence. Peer review was conducted using email correspondence. Both tests included both lower EA citizens and health care professionals. The beta testing was conducted using telephone interviews with citizens with lower EA. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.The developed decision aid presented information in steps, allowing citizens to read as much or as little as wanted. Values clarification questions were included after each section of information, and answers were summarized in a \"choice-indicator\" on the last page, guiding the citizens toward a decision about screening participation. Statistics were presented in both natural frequencies, absolute risk formats and graphically. The citizens easily and intuitively navigated around the final version of the decision aid and stated that they felt encouraged to think about the benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening without being overloaded with information. They found the decision aid easy to understand and the text of suitable length. The health care professionals agreed with the citizens on most parts; however, concerns were raised about the length and readability of the text.We have developed a self-administered decision aid presenting information in steps. We involved both citizens and health care professionals to target the decision aid for citizens with lower EA. This decision aid represents a new way of communicating detailed information and may be able to enhance informed choices about colorectal cancer screening participation among citizens with lower EA.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/jmir.org\/api\/download?alt_name=formative_v2i1e9_app1.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Telemedicine framework using case-based reasoning with evidences","abstract":"Telemedicine is the medical practice of information exchanged from one location to another through electronic communications to improve the delivery of health care services. This research article describes a telemedicine framework with knowledge engineering using taxonomic reasoning of ontology modeling and semantic similarity. In addition to being a precious support in the procedure of medical decision-making, this framework can be used to strengthen significant collaborations and traceability that are important for the development of official deployment of telemedicine applications. Adequate mechanisms for information management with traceability of the reasoning process are also essential in the fields of epidemiology and public health. In this paper we enrich the case-based reasoning process by taking into account former evidence-based knowledge. We use the regular four steps approach and implement an additional (iii) step: (i) establish diagnosis, (ii) retrieve treatment, (iii) apply evidence, (iv) adaptation, (v) retain. Each step is performed using tools from knowledge engineering and information processing (natural language processing, ontology, indexation, algorithm, etc.). The case representation is done by the taxonomy component of a medical ontology model. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example from the oncology domain. Medical ontology allows a good and efficient modeling of the patient and his treatment. We are pointing up the role of evidences and specialist's opinions in effectiveness and safety of care.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","oa_url":"https:\/\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\/hal-01256707\/file\/Kamsu_Foguem_13953.pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Web-Based Versus Usual Care and Other Formats of Decision Aids to Support Prostate Cancer Screening Decisions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","abstract":"Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer among men. Because screening for prostate cancer is a controversial issue, many experts in the field have defended the use of shared decision making using validated decision aids, which can be presented in different formats (eg, written, multimedia, Web). Recent studies have concluded that decision aids improve knowledge and reduce decisional conflict.This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the impact of using Web-based decision aids to support men's prostate cancer screening decisions in comparison with usual care and other formats of decision aids.We searched PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases up to November 2016. This search identified randomized controlled trials, which assessed Web-based decision aids for men making a prostate cancer screening decision and reported quality of decision-making outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened citations for inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Using a random-effects model, meta-analyses were conducted pooling results using mean differences (MD), standardized mean differences (SMD), and relative risks (RR).Of 2406 unique citations, 7 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. For risk of bias, selective outcome reporting and participant\/personnel blinding were mostly rated as unclear due to inadequate reporting. Based on seven items, two studies had high risk of bias for one item. Compared to usual care, Web-based decision aids increased knowledge (SMD 0.46; 95% CI 0.18-0.75), reduced decisional conflict (MD -7.07%; 95% CI -9.44 to -4.71), and reduced the practitioner control role in the decision-making process (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.31-0.81). Web-based decision aids compared to printed decision aids yielded no differences in knowledge, decisional conflict, and participation in decision or screening behaviors. Compared to video decision aids, Web-based decision aids showed lower average knowledge scores (SMD -0.50; 95% CI -0.88 to -0.12) and a slight decrease in prostate-specific antigen screening (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25).According to this analysis, Web-based decision aids performed similarly to alternative formats (ie, printed, video) for the assessed decision-quality outcomes. The low cost, readiness, availability, and anonymity of the Web can be an advantage for increasing access to decision aids that support prostate cancer screening decisions among men.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2196\/jmir.9070"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Association of immunohistochemical markers with premalignancy in Gonadal Dysgenesis","abstract":"Gonadal dysgenesis (GD) is associated with increased risk of gonadal malignancy. Determining a patient's risk and appropriate timing of gonadectomy is challenging, but immunohistochemical markers (IHM) may help establish the diagnosis of malignant germ cell tumors (GCT). Our objective was to identify the prevalence of specific IHM expression in patients with GD and determine if the patterns of expression can help identify malignancy versus pre-malignancy state. We evaluated the published literature using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to provide recommendations on the predictive role of IHM in the detection of germ cell malignancy.The data for this retrospective study included karyotype, gonadal location, external masculinization score, age at time of gonadectomy or biopsy, microscopic description and diagnosis of gonadal tissue, and immunohistochemical staining, including octamer binding transcription factor (OCT) 3\/4, placental-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), \u03b2-catenin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and stem cell factor receptor CD117 (c-KIT). Patients with complete or partial GD who had undergone gonadectomy or gonadal tissue biopsy were included.The study included 26 patients with GD, 3 of whom had evidence of GCT (11.5 %, gonadoblastoma, dysgerminoma): 2 had Swyer syndrome, 1 had 46,XY partial GD. One patient with XY partial GD had gonadoblastoma-like tissue. All 4 patients (15 %) had strong expressions of 4 tumor markers (OCT 3\/4, PLAP, \u03b2-catenin, CD117), as did 5 other patients (19 %, ages 2-14 months) without GCT: 4 had XY GD, 1 had 46,XX GD. \u03b2-catenin was expressed in 96 % of patients in a cytoplasmic pattern, CD117 in 78 %, OCT 3\/4 in 55 %, PLAP in 37 %, and AFP in 1 patient (4 %). Tumor marker expression was not specific for ruling out malignancy in patients <1 year.In patients older than 1 year, expression of all three markers (OCT 3\/4, PLAP, CD117) may be instrumental in the decision-making process for gonadectomy, even in the absence of overt germ cell malignancy. Our literature review suggests that OCT 3\/4 expression is most helpful in predicting risk of malignancy. Additional criteria are needed to stratify risk in patients younger than 1 year of age, as these markers are not reliable in that age group.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s13633-015-0010-6"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Blood and urine biomarkers in prostate cancer: Are we ready for reflex testing in men with an elevated prostate-specific antigen?","abstract":"There is no consensus on the role of biomarkers in determining the utility of prostate biopsy in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA). There are numerous biomarkers such as prostate health index, 4Kscore, prostate cancer antigen 3, ExoDX, SelectMDx, and Mi-Prostate Score that may be useful in this decision-making process. However, it is unclear whether any of these tests are accurate and cost-effective enough to warrant being a widespread reflex test following an elevated PSA. Our goal was to report on the clinical utility of these blood and urine biomarkers in prostate cancer screening.We performed a systematic review of studies published between January 2000 and October 2020 to report the available parameters and cost-effectiveness of the aforementioned diagnostic tests. We focus on the negative predictive value, the area under the curve, and the decision curve analysis in comparing reflexive tests due to their relevance in evaluating diagnostic screening tests.Overall, the biomarkers are roughly equivalent in predictive accuracy. Each test has additional clinical utility to the current diagnostic standard of care, but the added benefit is not substantial to justify using the test reflexively after an elevated PSA.Our findings suggest these biomarkers should not be used in binary fashion and should be understood in the context of pre-existing risk predictors, patient's ethnicity, cost of the test, patient life-expectancy, and patient goals. There are more recent diagnostic tools such as multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging, polygenic single-nucleotide panels, IsoPSA, and miR Sentinel tests that are promising in the realm of prostate cancer screening and need to be investigated further to be considered a consensus reflexive test in the setting of prostate cancer screening.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ajur.2021.06.003"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Rac-GEF\/Rac Signaling and Metastatic Dissemination in Lung Cancer","abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) representing \u223c85% of new diagnoses. The disease is often detected in an advanced metastatic stage, with poor prognosis and clinical outcome. In order to escape from the primary tumor, cancer cells acquire highly motile and invasive phenotypes that involve the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These processes are tightly regulated by Rac1, a small G-protein that participates in the formation of actin-rich membrane protrusions required for cancer cell motility and for the secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteases. In this perspective article we focus on the mechanisms leading to aberrant Rac1 signaling in NSCLC progression and metastasis, highlighting the role of Rac Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs). A plausible scenario is that specific Rac-GEFs activate discrete intracellular pools of Rac1, leading to unique functional responses in the context of specific oncogenic drivers, such as mutant EGFR or mutant KRAS. The identification of dysregulated Rac signaling regulators may serve to predict critical biomarkers for metastatic disease in lung cancer patients, ultimately aiding in refining patient prognosis and decision-making in the clinical setting.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fcell.2020.00118\/pdf"},"label_included":0}
{"title":"Validity of the French version of the Autonomy Preference Index and its adaptation for patients with advanced cancer","abstract":"While patient-centered care is recommended as a key dimension for quality improvement, in case of serious illness, patients may have different expectations regarding information and participation in medical decision-making. In oncology, anticipation of disease worsening remains difficult, especially when patient's preferences towards prognosis medical information are unclear. Valid tools to explore patients' preferences could help targeting end-of-life discussions, which have been shown to decrease aggressiveness of end-of-life care. Our aim was to establish the validity and reliability of the French version of the Autonomy Preference Index (API) among patients with incurable cancer and in primary care setting. Three supplementary items were specifically developed to evaluate preparedness to anticipate disease deterioration among patients with incurable cancer.The psychometric properties of the API translated into French were assessed among patients consecutively recruited from January to March 2017 in the waiting rooms of 19 general practitioners (N = 391) and in an oncology (N = 187) clinic in Paris. Relationships between the newly-developed items and the API subscale scores were studied.A three correlated factors confirmatory model (two factors related to decision-making and a factor related to information-seeking preferences) showed an acceptable fit on the whole sample and no measurement invariance issue was found across settings, age, sex and educational level. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were acceptable for the information-seeking and decision-making subscales. One of the newly-developed items on patients' ability to anticipate a decision on the use of artificial respiration if a sudden deterioration of their illness occurred was not related to the API subscale scores.The French version of the API was found valid and reliable for use in general practice and oncology settings. The additional items on patient preparedness to anticipate disease deterioration can be of interest to ensure that patient values guide all end-of-life clinical decisions.","open_access":{"is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","oa_url":"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0227802&type=printable"},"label_included":1}
