0,1,10051933,The effectiveness of clonidine as an analgesic in paediatric adenotonsillectomy.,E J Reimer; G S Dunn; C J Montgomery; P M Sanderson; L D Scheepers; P M Merrick,"To compare the analgesic effects of preoperative oral clonidine with intraoperative intravenous fentanyl in children undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. This randomized, controlled, double-blind study of 36 ASA I-II children, age 7-12 yr undergoing adenotonsillectomy was conducted at a tertiary care paediatric teaching hospital. Either 4 micrograms.kg-1 clonidine po was given 60-90 min preoperatively or 3 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl i.v. was given intraoperatively. Postoperatively visual analog pain scores (VAS) were recorded at rest and on swallowing every 10 min for the first 30 min and then every 15 min for two hours. Morphine 0.05 mg.kg-1 i.v. was given for VAS > or = 5. If > 3 doses were required, 1.5 mg.kg-1 codeine po and 20 mg.kg-1 acetaminophen po were given. Sedation and anxiety scores were recorded preoperatively. Haemodynamic changes, blood loss, recovery scores, and the incidence of vomiting, hypotension, and airway obstruction were recorded. Children who received clonidine had a higher incidence of preoperative sedation (63%) than those receiving fentanyl (6%). Preinduction mean arterial pressure was lower in the clonidine group but required no intervention. VAS scores were similar throughout the observation period. There was no difference either in the number of morphine or codeine rescue doses administered or in the incidence of side effects. Oral clonidine is an effective analgesic and sedative for children undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy.",1999.0,1
1,2,10053177,"A controlled trial of sustained-release bupropion, a nicotine patch, or both for smoking cessation.",D E Jorenby; S J Leischow; M A Nides; S I Rennard; J A Johnston; A R Hughes; S S Smith; M L Muramoto; D M Daughton; K Doan; M C Fiore; T B Baker,"Use of nicotine-replacement therapies and the antidepressant bupropion helps people stop smoking. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of sustained-release bupropion (244 subjects), a nicotine patch (244 subjects), bupropion and a nicotine patch (245 subjects), and placebo (160 subjects) for smoking cessation. Smokers with clinical depression were excluded. Treatment consisted of nine weeks of bupropion (150 mg a day for the first three days, and then 150 mg twice daily) or placebo, as well as eight weeks of nicotine-patch therapy (21 mg per day during weeks 2 through 7, 14 mg per day during week 8, and 7 mg per day during week 9) or placebo. The target day for quitting smoking was usually day 8. The abstinence rates at 12 months were 15.6 percent in the placebo group, as compared with 16.4 percent in the nicotine-patch group, 30.3 percent in the bupropion group (P<0.001), and 35.5 percent in the group given bupropion and the nicotine patch (P<0.001). By week 7, subjects in the placebo group had gained an average of 2.1 kg, as compared with a gain of 1.6 kg in the nicotine-patch group, a gain of 1.7 kg in the bupropion group, and a gain of 1.1 kg in the combined-treatment group (P<0.05). Weight gain at seven weeks was significantly less in the combined-treatment group than in the bupropion group and the placebo group (P<0.05 for both comparisons). A total of 311 subjects (34.8 percent) discontinued one or both medications. Seventy-nine subjects stopped treatment because of adverse events: 6 in the placebo group (3.8 percent), 16 in the nicotine-patch group (6.6 percent), 29 in the bupropion group (11.9 percent), and 28 in the combined-treatment group (11.4 percent). The most common adverse events were insomnia and headache. Treatment with sustained-release bupropion alone or in combination with a nicotine patch resulted in significantly higher long-term rates of smoking cessation than use of either the nicotine patch alone or placebo. Abstinence rates were higher with combination therapy than with bupropion alone, but the difference was not statistically significant.",2000.0,1
2,3,10066996,Effects of methylphenidate on complex cognitive processing in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.,Tamara Berman; Virginia I Douglas; Ronald G Barr,"Three experiments were conducted to explore the effects of methylphenidate (MPH), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis, and age on performance on a complex visual-memory search task. Results showed that the effects of MPH varied with information load. On low-processing loads, all doses of MPH helped children with ADHD to improve accuracy with no cost to reaction time (RT), whereas on high loads, higher MPH doses improved error rates while slowing RT. Without medication, children with ADHD showed high error rates and slow RTs across both low and high loads, as did younger, normal control children. Because MPH slowed performance on only the most difficult, high-load conditions, it is argued that the drug improves self-regulatory ability, enabling children with ADHD to adapt differentially to high and low loads.",1999.0,0
3,4,10072008,Spinal clonidine prolongs labor analgesia from spinal sufentanil and bupivacaine.,R D'Angelo; E Evans; L A Dean; R Gaver; J C Eisenach,"We sought to determine whether spinal clonidine 50 microg prolongs the analgesia from the spinal administration of sufentanil 7.5 microg and bupivacaine 2.5 mg early in the first stage of labor. Thirty patients were randomized to receive a 2-mL spinal injection of sufentanil 7.5 microg + bupivacaine 2.5 mg with or without clonidine 50 microg using a combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique. Pain, nausea, pruritus, sedation, motor block, blood pressure, and heart rate were assessed until the patient requested additional analgesia. Analgesia was significantly prolonged in patients who received spinal sufentanil + bupivacaine + clonidine (197 +/- 70 vs 132 +/- 39 min; P = 0.004). Pain scores and side effects, including motor block, sedation, and hypotension, were similar between groups. Spinal clonidine significantly prolongs labor analgesia from spinal sufentanil and bupivacaine without producing serious adverse side effects. We studied the effects of spinal clonidine administered with spinal sufentanil and bupivacaine on labor analgesia using a combined spinal-epidural technique and conclude that spinal clonidine significantly prolongs labor analgesia from spinal sufentanil and bupivacaine without producing serious adverse effects.",1999.0,0
4,5,10072410,Low-dose clozapine for the treatment of drug-induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease.,Parkinson Study Group,"Drug-induced psychosis is a difficult problem to manage in patients with Parkinson's disease. Multiple open-label studies have reported that treatment with clozapine at low doses ameliorates psychosis without worsening parkinsonism. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low doses of clozapine (6.25 to 50 mg per day) in 60 patients at six sites over a period of 14 months. The patients (mean age, 72 years) had idiopathic Parkinson's disease and drug-induced psychosis of at least four weeks' duration. All the patients continued to receive fixed doses of antiparkinsonian drugs during the four weeks of the trial. Blood counts were monitored weekly in all the patients. The mean dose of clozapine was 24.7 mg per day. The patients in the clozapine group had significantly more improvement than those in the placebo group in all three of the measures used to determine the severity of psychosis. The mean (+/-SE) scores on the Clinical Global Impression Scale improved by 1.6+/-0.3 points for the patients receiving clozapine, as compared with 0.5+/-0.2 point for those receiving placebo (P<0.001). The score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale improved by 9.3+/-1.5 points for the patients receiving clozapine, as compared with 2.6+/-1.3 points for those receiving placebo (P=0.002). The score on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms improved by 11.8+/-2.0 points for the patients receiving clozapine, as compared with 3.8+/-1.9 points for those receiving placebo (P=0.01). Seven patients treated with clozapine had an improvement of at least three on the seven-point Clinical Global Impression Scale, as compared with only one patient given placebo. Clozapine treatment improved tremor and had no deleterious effect on the severity of parkinsonism. In one patient, clozapine was discontinued because of leukopenia. Clozapine, at daily doses of 50 mg or less, is safe and significantly improves drug-induced psychosis without worsening parkinsonism.",1999.0,1
5,6,10078501,Predictors of relapse following response from a first episode of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.,D Robinson; M G Woerner; J M Alvir; R Bilder; R Goldman; S Geisler; A Koreen; B Sheitman; M Chakos; D Mayerhoff; J A Lieberman,"We examined relapse after response to a first episode of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients with first-episode schizophrenia were assessed on measures of psychopathologic variables, cognition, social functioning, and biological variables and treated according to a standardized algorithm. The sample for the relapse analyses consisted of 104 patients who responded to treatment of their index episode and were at risk for relapse. Five years after initial recovery, the cumulative first relapse rate was 81.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.6%-93.2%); the second relapse rate was 78.0% (95% CI, 46.5%-100.0%). By 4 years after recovery from a second relapse, the cumulative third relapse rate was 86.2% (95% CI, 61.5%-100.0%). Discontinuing antipsychotic drug therapy increased the risk of relapse by almost 5 times (hazard ratio for an initial relapse, 4.89 [99% CI, 2.49-9.60]; hazard ratio for a second relapse, 4.57 [99% CI, 1.49-14.02]). Subsequent analyses controlling for antipsychotic drug use showed that patients with poor premorbid adaptation to school and premorbid social withdrawal relapsed earlier. Sex, diagnosis, obstetric complications, duration of psychotic illness before treatment, baseline symptoms, neuroendocrine measures, methylphenidate hydrochloride challenge response, neuropsychologic and magnetic resonance imaging measures, time to response of the initial episode, adverse effects during treatment, and presence of residual symptoms after the initial episode were not significantly related to time to relapse. There is a high rate of relapse within 5 years of recovery from a first episode of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. This risk is diminished by maintenance antipsychotic drug treatment.",1999.0,0
6,7,10084637,"Comparison of risperidone and placebo for psychosis and behavioral disturbances associated with dementia: a randomized, double-blind trial. Risperidone Study Group.",I R Katz; D V Jeste; J E Mintzer; C Clyde; J Napolitano; M Brecher,"We report the findings from the first large, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of psychotic and behavioral symptoms in institutionalized elderly patients with dementia. 625 patients (67.8% women; mean age = 82.7 years) with DSM-IV diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (73%), vascular dementia (15%), or mixed dementia (12%) and significant psychotic and behavioral symptoms were included. Each patient was randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/day, 1 mg/day, or 2 mg/day of risperidone for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease rating scale (BEHAVE-AD). The study was completed by 70% of the patients. Baseline Functional Assessment Staging scores were 6 or 7 in more than 95% of the patients, indicating severe dementia. At endpoint, significantly greater reductions in BEHAVE-AD total scores and psychosis and aggressiveness subscale scores were seen in patients receiving 1 and 2 mg/day of risperidone than in placebo patients (p = .005 and p < .001, respectively). At week 12, 0.5 mg/day of risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing BEHAVE-AD aggression scores (p = .02). More adverse events were reported by patients receiving 2 mg/day of risperidone than 1 mg/day. The most common dose-related adverse events were extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, and mild peripheral edema. The frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms in patients receiving 1 mg/day of risperidone was not significantly greater than in placebo patients. Risperidone significantly improved symptoms of psychosis and aggressive behavior in patients with severe dementia. Results show that 1 mg/day of risperidone is an appropriate dose for most elderly patients with dementia.",1999.0,0
7,8,10088136,THA improves word priming and clonidine enhances fluency and working memory in Alzheimer's disease.,P Riekkinen; M Riekkinen,"We investigated the effects of a single administration of a cholinesterase inhibitor, tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA, 25 and 50 mg, orally), and an alpha 2-agonist, clonidine (0.5 and 2 micrograms/kg, orally), on neuropsychologic performance in two groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clonidine enhanced a spatial working memory and verbal fluency, but had no effect on spatial span or word priming. THA enhanced word priming, but had no effect on other performance measures. Our data suggests that degeneration of the LC noradrenergic system and the cholinergic cells of the basal forebrain have different functional consequences during the progression of AD. Finally, a combined treatment with noradrenergic and cholinergic drugs might produce a qualitatively broader effect on cognitive functions than either of the treatments alone, and more effectively attenuate clinical dementia.",2001.0,0
8,9,10090111,Diuretics and beta-blockers do not have adverse effects at 1 year on plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles in men with hypertension. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents.,M R Lakshman; D J Reda; B J Materson; W C Cushman; E D Freis,"Concern based on the reported short-term adverse effects of antihypertensive agents on plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles (PLPPs) has complicated the therapy for hypertension. To compare the long-term (1-year) effects of 6 different antihypertensive drugs and placebo on PLPPs in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial in 15 US Veterans Affairs medical centers. A total of 1292 ambulatory men, 21 years or older, with diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) ranging from 95 to 109 mm Hg taking placebo were randomized to receive placebo or 1 of 6 antihypertensive drugs: hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, or prazosin. After drug titration, patients with a DBP of less than 90 mm Hg were followed up for 1 year. Plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles were determined at baseline, after initial titration, and at 1 year. After 8 weeks on a regimen of hydrochlorothiazide, increases of 3.3 mg/dL (0.09 mmol/L) in total cholesterol and 2.7 mg/dL in apolipoprotein B were significantly different (P< or =.05) from decreases of 9.3 mg/dL in total cholesterol and 5.4 mg/dL in ApoB levels while receiving prazosin but not from placebo. Patients achieving positive DBP control using hydrochlorothiazide (responders) showed no adverse changes in PLPPs, whereas nonresponders exhibited increases in triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles did not change significantly among treatment groups after 1 year except for minor decreases in high-density lipoprotein 2 levels using hydrochlorothiazide, clonidine, and atenolol. None of these 6 antihypertensive drugs has any long-term adverse effects on PLPPs and, therefore, may be safely prescribed. Previously reported short-term adverse effects from using hydrochlorothiazide are limited to nonresponders.",1999.0,0
9,10,10091617,Selegiline-induced postural hypotension in Parkinson's disease: a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdrawal.,A Churchyard; C J Mathias; A J Lees,"The United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Research Group (UKPDRG) trial found an increased mortality in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) randomized to receive 10 mg selegiline per day and L-dopa compared with those taking L-dopa alone. Recently, we found that therapy with selegiline and L-dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline. This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure. The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension. The cardiovascular responses to standing and head-up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn. Head-up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures. A lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing. Orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug. Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action. This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L-dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension. The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of amphetamine and metamphetamine are discussed.",1999.0,0
