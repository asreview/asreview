They consist of foregut duplication cysts, small bowel duplication cysts, and large bowel duplication cysts. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been widely used as a modality for the evaluation and diagnosis of duplication cysts. EUS is the diagnostic tool of choice to investigate duplication cysts since it can distinguish between solid and cystic lesions. The question of whether or not to perform EUS-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) on a lesion suspected of being a duplication cyst is controversial as these lesions can become infected with significant consequences, although EUS-FNA is often required to obtain a definitive diagnosis and to rule out more ominous lesions.

The management of foregut duplication cysts is controversial, especially in asymptomatic patients. The safety and accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-fine-needle aspiration EUS-FNA) in confirming the nature of cysts by using electron microscopy (EM) has not been reported. In this study, the authors describe the utility of demonstrating detached ciliary tufts (DCTs) in the diagnosis of foregut duplication cysts with EUS-FNA. METHODS. Consecutive patients with suspected mediastinal masses or mediastinal cysts on imaging studies were evaluated prospectively by EUS and EUS-FNA. Cyst fluid was examined by routine cytologic techniques. In two patients, EM was performed to confirm the nature of DCTs. RESULTS. Ten consecutive patients were evaluated with EUS and EUS-FNA. Seventy percent of the cysts were characterized by computed tomography (CT) scans as solid masses. The mean greatest cyst dimension measured 34 mm × 48 mm by EUS. Microscopic examination of the cyst content revealed mucinous material, cellular debris, and DCTs. The latter were seen in routine cytologic preparations and by EM. Patients were followed up to a median of 321 days. Due to EUS-FNA confirmatory diagnoses of foregut duplication cysts, none of the patients except 1 underwent surgical resection after developing pneumonia 6 months later. Histologic sections of the resected specimen confirmed the presence of (foregut cyst, bronchogenic type). All other patients were asymptomatic. Cysts size and nature did not change on repeated imaging studies. CONCLUSIONS. EUS was superior compared with CT scanning in characterizing foregut duplication cysts. EUS-FNA is safe and accurate in the diagnosis of foregut duplication cysts. The demonstration of DCTs in cyst fluid and the absence of malignant cells confirmed the benign nature of these lesions, allowing conservative and expectant management for these patients. © 2004 American Cancer Society.",,,,"cyst fluid, endoscopic ultrasonography, fine needle aspiration biopsy, foregut duplication cyst (diagnosis), mediastinum cyst (diagnosis)","adult, aged, article, cancer cell, cancer cytodiagnosis, ciliary tuft, computer assisted tomography, conservative treatment, diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic value, electron microscopy, evaluation study, female, histopathology, human, major clinical study, male, mediastinum mass, priority journal, risk assessment, solid malignant neoplasm, symptomatology","adult, aged, article, cancer cell, cancer cytodiagnosis, ciliary tuft, computer assisted tomography, conservative treatment, diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic value, electron microscopy, evaluation study, female, histopathology, human, major clinical study, male, mediastinum mass, priority journal, risk assessment, solid malignant neoplasm, symptomatology",,,,,,http://sfx.library.uu.nl/utrecht?sid=EMBASE&issn=0008543X&id=doi:10.1002%2Fcncr.20369&atitle=Endoscopic+ultrasound-guided+fine-needle+aspiration+in+the+diagnosis+of+foregut+duplication+cysts%3A+The+value+of+demonstrating+detached+ciliary+tufts+in+cyst+fluid&stitle=Cancer&title=Cancer&volume=102&issue=4&spage=253&epage=258&aulast=Eloubeidi&aufirst=Mohamad+A.&auinit=M.A.&aufull=Eloubeidi+M.A.&coden=CANCA&isbn=&pages=253-258&date=2004&auinit1=M&auinitm=A,"Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

These cysts lack a connection to the gastrointestinal tract or the adjacent mesenteric vasculature and have only been reported in 10 case reports. In these reports, only two reports were cases with malignant transformation. Our case was a report for the advanced cancer of the isolated enteric duplication cyst. Case presentation: The patient was a 43 year-old woman with slightly abdominal pain and mass formation. The abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed 130 × 100 × 90 mm huge cystic mass existed in right upper peritoneal cavity. The cystic mass had thickened wall and many enhanced nodules. As these imaging findings suggested a tumor originated from pancreas and the preoperative diagnose was suspect of mucinous cystic neoplasm. In operative findings, the tumor originated from pancreatic head and did not attach to gastrointestinal tract. Final pathology indicated the cyst was an isolated advanced enteric duplication cyst cancer and not originated from pancreas. Conclusion: We experienced an extremely rare case of completely isolated advanced enteric duplication cyst cancer. Unique to this case, the preoperative diagnosis was suspect of mucinous cystic neoplasm arising from pancreas head and partial pancreatectomy was performed.

The second patient was a 26-year-old woman who had a history, over several years, of chronic epigastric abdominal pain radiating to her back. Both lesions were surgically removed. They showed the same histomorphology. The cysts were lined by a pseudostratified respiratory epithelium with ciliated cells. The first cyst was connected to the stomach, while the second cyst was not connected. Both cysts expressed thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and surfactant.

Date of Publication: 1 Mar 2017,"Background: Enteric duplication cysts are congenital malformations that typically affect children in infancy, but can also affect adults. Rarely, these cysts can be complicated by malignancy. We present the first case of retroperitoneal duplication cyst that was complicated by malignancy transformation and managed by robot-assisted excision. Case presentation: A 64-year-old female with a history of a left-sided renal cyst presented with a 4-month history of abdominal pain and fatigue. MRI revealed a bilobed cyst, with components measuring 6.9 × 6.6 and 6.1 × 6.9 cm, which had grown since previous imaging, and hemorrhage in some portions of the cysts, as well as cystic wall enhancement, suggesting a possible malignancy. The patient consented to a robot-assisted partial (possible radical) nephrectomy. During the procedure, the cystic structure appeared to have grown since imaging, was intimately associated with the hilum, and had a complex vasculature, which prompted us to perform a radical nephrectomy. Grossly, the specimen consisted of a 14.8 cm cystic structure at the superior portion of the kidney, but was not contained within the renal parenchyma. Histologically, the internal mucosa of the cyst showed columnar epithelium with high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma in situ with focal individual cell infiltration into the superficial portion of the inferior part of the cyst. The patient saw a medical oncologist and was instructed to follow up with quarterly imaging to assess for disease progression. Conclusion: Enteric duplication cysts are uncommon entities that can occur in various locations in the body, causing a wide spectrum of symptoms, and are rarely complicated by malignancy transformation.
