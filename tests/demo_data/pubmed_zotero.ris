AB  - Introduction: There are studies demonstrating the relation between psychological  factors and efficiency of treatment in the course of inflammatory bowel diseases  (IBD). Aim: To investigate the relation between cognitive flexibility and flexibility in coping with stress and the quality of life, as well as the sense of satisfaction with life, in patients undergoing the biological treatment. Material and methods: The study group consisted of 33 adults who were diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). The Flexibility in Coping with Stress Questionnaire (FCSQ-14), the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI), the Quality of Life SF36v2 Questionnaire, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the socio-demographic questionnaire were used to gather the data. Results: A total of 14 females and 19 males were included in this analysis. The results did not prove that the disease diagnosis (UC or CD) differed the level of psychological resources. However, older respondents achieved lower results in cognitive flexibility. A positive correlation was observed between both cognitive flexibility and flexibility in coping with stress and different dimensions of quality of life and satisfaction with life. Conclusions: There is a relationship  between both cognitive flexibility and flexibility in coping with stress and health-related quality of life. These factors can be considered to be a kind of resource that helps to cope with challenges posed by a chronic illness, including IBD. Therefore, it is significant to increase their level by applying tailored therapeutic methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is considered a risk factor for many chronic diseases and obese patients are often considered higher risk surgical candidates. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the outcomes of obese (body mass index >/= 30  kg/m(2)) versus non-obese patients undergoing surgery for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase libraries were searched up to  March 2019 for studies comparing outcomes of obese with non-obese patients undergoing surgery for IBD. A meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager software to create forest plots and calculate odds ratios and mean differences. RESULTS: Four thousand three hundred and eleven patients from five observational  studies were included. Obese patients were older at the time of surgery and more  likely to have diabetes. Obese patients had longer operative times (MD 23.28, 95% CI 14.63-31.93, p < 0.001), higher intra-operative blood loss (MD 45.32, 95% CI 5.89-84.76, p = 0.02), longer length of stay (MD 0.90, 95% CI 0.60-1.20, p < 0.001), higher wound infection rates (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.39-2.23, p < 0.001), and  higher total postoperative complication rates (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.70, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with significantly worse outcomes following IBD-specific surgery, including longer operative times, greater blood loss, longer length of stay, higher wound infection rates, and higher total postoperative complication rates. Clinicians should be mindful of these increased risks when counselling patients and consider weight reduction strategies where possible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a universal chronic nonspecific intestinal inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. Although 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)  is used as a first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate UC, some patients do not react well to it. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays a complementary role in the management of UC. A large number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that TCM has a significant effect in the treatment of mild-to-moderate UC. However, due to the diversity of TCM treatments, its relative effectiveness and safety remains unclear. Therefore, we aim to compare the effectiveness and safety of TCM for mild-to-moderate UC by implementing a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) and provide a reference for clinical treatment. METHODS: According to the Cochrane Handbook, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the  Cochrane Library, CINAHL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CHKD-CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM), and WANFANG database will be searched. Related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared one TCM intervention with another or with 5-ASA (placebo) for mild-to-moderate UC from inceptions to February 2019 will be included. Two authors will screen the literature and extract data independently based on predesigned rules, and evaluate the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Both classical pair-wise meta-analysis and Bayesian NMA will be conducted using R-3.4.4 and WinBUGS-1.4.3 software. The ranking probabilities for all interventions will be estimated and the hierarchy of each intervention will be summarized as surface under the cumulative ranking curve. The consistency within  network will be evaluated with Cochrane Q statistic and net-heat plot. The quality of evidence will be assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: The study results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal publication or conference presentation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings will provide a systematic evidence-based medical evidence of TCM interventions in the treatment of UC and help clinical practitioners, UC patients, and policy-makers make more informed choices in the decision-making. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval and informed consent are not required since this is a protocol for a network meta-analysis based on published studies. The findings will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal publication or conference presentation. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42019133962.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based programs are increasingly used as a part of integrated treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the majority  of research has been quantitative with limited qualitative exploration of patients' experiences of mindfulness programs and no studies among adolescents and young adults with IBD. Furthermore, there has been a paucity of research exploring the role of common psychotherapy and group factors within mindfulness programs. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the experiences of adolescents and young adults with IBD and depression who completed a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group program, as well as the role of therapeutic alliance, group affiliation, and other common psychotherapy and group factors. METHODS: This mixed methods qualitative study, nested within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of MBCT for adolescents and young adults with IBD, will obtain qualitative data from focus groups and open-ended survey questions. The study aims to conduct three to four focus groups with 6-8 participants in each group. It will employ data and investigator triangulation as well as thematic analysis of the qualitative data. RESULTS: The study was approved by the Mater Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee and recruitment commenced in May 2019; study completion is anticipated by early 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The study will contribute to the assessment of acceptability and feasibility of the MBCT program for adolescents and young adults with IBD. It will also elucidate the role of previously unexplored common psychotherapy and group factors within mindfulness training and help inform the design of a future large-scale RCT of MBCT in this cohort.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) also suffer from a wide range of additional disorders, which may be caused by the disease, the side  effect of the medication, or a lack of physical activity (PA). This results in reduced physical and psychological wellbeing. However, as known from other chronic diseases exercise could be utilized as supportive therapy for IBD patients. Main goals of this article are (a) collecting data of the effects structured physical activity interventions have on validated clinical parameters  of IBD and health related symptoms, (b) developing activity recommendations for this clientele. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted, searching for relevant articles published until May 2018, which investigated the effects of structured exercise interventions in IBD patients. The heterogeneity of the outcomes and the interventions did not support a quantitative synthesis thus, a qualitative discussion of the studies is provided. RESULTS: After reviewing 353 records, 13 eligible articles were identified. Five studies investigated aerobic exercise, three studies resistance exercise, three studies mind-body therapies and two studies yoga. The quality of the studies is mixed, and the duration is rather short for exercise interventions. Only few studies assessed validated IBD activity markers or inflammatory biomarkers. Nevertheless, the patients showed an increase in fitness, bone mineral density (BMD), quality of life and a decrease of IBD induced stress and anxiety. No severe adversial events were reported. CONCLUSION: Even though the evidence is limited the application of exercise interventions in IBD patients can be assumed to be safe and beneficial for the patients' overall-health, and IBD specific physical and psychosocial symptoms. But there is still a high demand for more thoroughly conducted studies, focussing on important clinical outcome parameters.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) is associated with substantial healthcare related  costs and impairment of quality of life. Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) is  proved to be effective for CD in animal and human. However, there is no systemic  review and meta-analysis regarding the clinical efficacy and safety of TwHF preparation for the treatment of CD. METHODS: Six electronic databases (Medline,  EMBASE, Cochrane database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database and Chongqing VIP Database) will be searched for eligibility studies. Data from the included studies will be extracted and the quality of studies will  be assessed. Data synthesis will be performed using Review Manager software. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment will also be carried out. RESULTS: This systemic review and meta-analysis will provide synthesized result of clinical efficacy and safety of TwHF preparation for the treatment of CD. CONCLUSION: This research will determine the clinical efficacy and safety of TwHF preparation for the treatment of CD.Registration: PROSPERO CRD42019127893.
