AB  - Considering that self-criticism is an important process in the development and maintenance of depression, and taking into account the stigma associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the present study aimed to analyse whether self-criticism exacerbates the relationships of depression symptoms with IBD symptomatology and chronic illness-related shame. The sample included 53 ambulatory IBD patients (66% females) with ages from 18 to 65. Moderation analyses were conducted using structural equation modelling. Self-criticism exacerbated the associations of depression with IBD symptoms (b = 0.01; standard error [SE] = 0.00; Z = 3.73; P < .001) and illness shame (b = 0.02; SE = 0.01; Z = 2.40; P = .016). For the same level of IBD symptomatology or chronic illness-related shame, those individuals who present more feelings of inadequacy towards the self, experience more symptoms of depression. This exacerbation effect is stronger when IBD symptomatology and chronic illness-related shame are more intense. A high self-critical IBD patient may view the illness and/or symptomatology as a flaw or error that should be self-corrected. Physicians and other health professionals should be attentive to these pathological mechanisms and should attempt to alleviate them. It may be beneficial to refer high self-critical patients to psychological care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the role of body image problems in the context of inflammatory bowel disease and to explore gender differences in these associations. A sample of inflammatory bowel disease patients (60 males and 140 females) was collected. Findings from a multi-group analysis show that inflammatory bowel disease symptomatology may impact on body image in both male and female patients through the effect of body-image-related cognitive fusion. Body image difficulties in the context of inflammatory bowel disease should not be a neglected dimension in research aiming at understanding the psychosocial effects of inflammatory bowel disease and by health professionals working with these patients.

AB  - Objective: The adult INTERMED is used to determine case complexity and psychosocial needs. We developed and validated a pediatric version of the INTERMED for children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and assessed its utility in predicting healthcare utilization. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of children (aged 8-17 y) with IBD (n = 148) and their parents, seen in a hospital-based clinic. Subjects completed semi-structured interviews that were scored on the 34 pIBD-INTERMED items. To assess inter-rater reliability, 40 interviews were videotaped and scored by a second assessor. Convergent and predictive validity were assessed by examining the relation of the pIBD-INTERMED to standardized measures of psychological, social, and family functioning, disease activity, and healthcare utilization. Results: Correlational analyses supported the validity of all five pIBD-INTERMED domains with very good inter-rater reliability (median r = 0.87) and internal consistency (alpha = 0.91) for the total complexity index. Ratings of 2-3 on the pIBD-INTERMED "mental health/cognitive threat" item were associated with greater odds of behavior and social problems (CBCL-Internalizing scale OR = 7.27, 95% CI 2.17-24.36); CBCL-Externalizing scale OR = 24.79, 95% CI 5.00-122.84), depression (Children's Depression Inventory OR = 8.52, 95% CI 1.70-43.02) and anxiety (Multidimensional Anxiety for Children OR = 11.57, 95% CI 3.00-45.37). The pIBD-INTERMED complexity index added significantly to the prediction of healthcare utilization, beyond the contribution of disease severity. Conclusions: The pIBD-INTERMED is a reliable and valid tool for identifying psychosocial risks and needs of children with IBD. It can be used to guide planning of individualized care and enhance interdisciplinary pediatric IBD care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, gastrointestinal condition that involves a range of debilitating bowel symptoms. Adjustment to living with IBD can be negatively impacted by maladaptive cognitive and behavioural factors (e.g. negative illness representations and repressing emotions). Patient samples also report negative reactions from the general public and such perceptions can further negatively impact people living with IBD. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review literature investigating the illness perceptions, perceived stigmatisation, and negative emotional reactions toward IBD within patient and community samples. We also aimed to review how these factors impact those living with IBD (i.e. adjustment, psychological health).Design: A range of databases (e.g. Psych INFO, PubMed) were searched over two years. One reviewer individually screened titles and abstracts using the specified inclusion criteria, and this process was repeated by a second reviewer. Subsequently, the full text articles were screened and data were extracted for the 82 articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Following data extraction, a narrative synthesis was conducted.Results: The review of 82 studies suggested that negative illness perceptions are linked to poorer psychosocial outcomes, that patient samples frequently anticipate stigmatisation, fear relating to bowel accidents was the most common emotion reported, and that the general public direct little enacted stigma towards IBD.Conclusion: For people living with IBD: (i) poorer psychological adjustment was reported by those who held more negative perceptions and reactions toward their illness; and (ii) their concerns regarding public perceptions of IBD warrants further empirical attention. Results emphasise the importance of targeting perceptions, and facilitating education and adaptive responding during treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: A growing body of scientific evidence supports the role of food and diet in the pathogenesis and management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, little is known about the role of food and diet from the perspectives of pediatric patients and their parents. This study aimed to explore how children and adolescents with IBD and their parents coped with the illness through food and diet in their daily lives. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 children and adolescents with IBD, 26 parents and one grandparent. Results: Two major themes, dietary strategies and family food practices, were identified through thematic analysis. There were three types of dietary strategies: food avoidance and moderation; following a specific diet; and healthy eating. For family food practices, two subthemes were identified: impact on grocery shopping, meal planning, and cooking; and maintaining routine and normality. Conclusions: Our findings have important implications for the clinical care of pediatric IBD. Notably, IBD not only influenced the food practices of the pediatric patients, but also their parents and other family members. Healthcare professionals should consider the family unit when giving nutritional advice or developing nutritional guidelines. Personalized nutritional counselling and ongoing nutritional assessment are also warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - AbstractYouth with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often experience psychological difficulties, such as anxiety and depression. This randomized controlled study tested whether a 3-month disease-specific cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in addition to standard medical care versus standard medical care only was effective in improving these youth's psychological outcomes. As this study was aimed at prevention, we included 70 youth (10-25 years) with IBD and symptoms of subclinical anxiety and/or depression, and measured psychological outcomes at 6- and 12-month follow-up. In general, participants in both groups showed improvements in anxiety, depression, health-related quality of life, social functioning, coping, and illness perceptions, sustained until 12 months follow-up. Overall, we found no differences between those receiving additional CBT and those receiving standard medical care only. We assume that this can be explained by the perceived low burden (both somatically and psychologically) or heightened awareness of psychological difficulties and IBD. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02265588.
