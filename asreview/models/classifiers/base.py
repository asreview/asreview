    Base model, abstract class to be implemented by derived ones.

    All the non-abstract methods are okay if they are not implemented.
    All functions dealing with hyperparameters can be ignore if you don't
    use hyperopt for hyperparameter tuning.
    There is a distinction between model parameters, which are needed during
    model creation and fit parameters, which are used during the fitting
    process. Fit parameters can be distinct from fit_kwargs (which are passed
    to the fit function).
