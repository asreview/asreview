    Random forest classifier (``rf``).

    The Random Forest classifier is an implementation based
    on the sklearn Random Forest classifier.

    Arguments
    ---------
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of trees in the forest.
    max_features: int, default=10
        Number of features in the model.
    class_weight: float, default=1.0
        Class weight of the inclusions.
    random_state : int or RandomState, default=None
        Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used
        when building trees and the sampling of the features to consider when
        looking for the best split at each node.
