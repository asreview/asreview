    Class to get the two way rebalancing function and arguments.
    It super samples ones depending on the number of 0's and total number
    of samples in the training data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a: float
        Governs the weight of the 1's. Higher values mean linearly more 1's
        in your training sample.
    alpha: float
        Governs the scaling the weight of the 1's, as a function of the
        ratio of ones to zeros. A positive value means that the lower the
        ratio of zeros to ones, the higher the weight of the ones.
    b: float
        Governs how strongly we want to sample depending on the total
        number of samples. A value of 1 means no dependence on the total
        number of samples, while lower values mean increasingly stronger
        dependence on the number of samples.
    beta: float
        Governs the scaling of the weight of the zeros depending on the
        number of samples. Higher values means that larger samples are more
        strongly penalizing zeros.
