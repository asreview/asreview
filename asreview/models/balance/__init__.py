"""Balance strategies to rebalance and reorder the training data.

There are several balance strategies that rebalance and reorder the
training data. This is sometimes necessary, because the data is often
very imbalanced: there are many more records that should be excluded than
included (otherwise, automation cannot help much anyway).

There are several balance strategies available. In configuration
files, parameters are found under the section ``[balance_param]``.
