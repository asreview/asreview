# ASReview Test Suite

This folder contains the test suite of the ASReview app. It is organized in the following folders:

- **config**: Contains data to create user accounts and a number of TOML files to start the ASReview app in different modes (e.g. authenticated, authentication with verification, etc).

- **data**: Contains project data used in tests.

- **integration_tests**: Contains integration tests. See README.md in this folder.

- **test_api**: Contains API related tests. These tests are independent, unit-like tests.

- **test_database_and_models**: Contains tests that focus on basic database operations and several SQL_Alchemy models that are used in the authenticated version of the ASReview app.

- **test_extensions**: Forthcoming.

- **utils**: Contains various helper files that facilitate writing tests.

## Requirements

1. [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)
2. [Pytest-random-order](https://github.com/jbasko/pytest-random-order)

## Fixtures

If you are unfamiliar with Pytest: fixtures enable a setup and teardown mechanism for all tests. They ensure a controlled initial state and clean up afterwards to make sure the next test is conducted with a clean slate.

In this suite, all fixtures are defined in `conftest.py` files. These fixtures are automatically picked up by Pytest and can be found in the `/webapp/tests`-folder, but also in nested folders. The nested conftest modules use fixtures defined in the tests-folder without actually importing them: Pytest finds the required fixture if you use their function-name as parameter in either a newly defined fixture or test function.

Note that the `conftest.py` in the `/webapp/tests` contains an important fixture `asreview_path_fixture`. This suite uses an alternative ASReview folder to avoid disrupting the data of the app in production or development mode. The `asreview_path_fixture` fixture ensures that for every test the ASReview app always starts with its own dedicated, temporary, ASReview folder. Pytest states that these folders are automatically removed (https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/tmp_path.html#the-default-base-temporary-directory). This might be unwanted behavior if checking the state of the ASReview folder is required. If so, simply create your own ASReview folder in the `asreview_path_fixture` fixture.

## Test functions

Ideally a test function tests one particular feature and can be executed independently from other test functions. If you would like to add a feature or an enhancement to the ASReview app, please accompany your code with appropriate tests. Append your tests to existing modules, or create a new module. If you are adding routes to the API, please wrap your test API calls in a function and place it in `/utils/api_utils.py`. If applicable, make sure your feature works both in an authenticated and an unauthenticated environment.

## Running the tests

**Important**: if you run the entire test suite, please make sure you have compiled the app's assets:

```
python setup.py compile_assets
```

Please run your tests __from the root directory__ with the `--random-order` option to ensure test independency. With Pytest you can run all tests within a particular module. For example:

```
pytest --random-order -s -v ./asreview/webapp/tests/test_api/test_projects.py
```

The `-s` option enables capturing stdout (shows your print statements if there are any), and the `-v` option makes the output more verbose. Run an entire folder containing test modules like so:

```
pytest --random-order -s -v ./asreview/webapp/tests/test_api/
```

If you are in the middle of writing your tests, and your module contains many tests, it is more efficient to run a small cluster or a single test. One of the many possibilities is the `-k` option that executes only tests with a function name that ends with a certain postfix. In the next example we execute only test functions that end with the 'current`postfix in the`test_projects.py` module:

```
pytest --random-order -s -v ./asreview/webapp/tests/test_api/test_projects.py -k current
```

## Database

A database is needed to run the tests for authenticated versions of the app. In the `config` file a number of TOML configuration files exist that are used to create different versions of the app. The configuration files that create an authenticated version of the app lack the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` parameter! That parameter tells the backend where it can find the database. If that parameter is missing, the app will create and initialize a sqlite3 database automatically. After the test suite has been executed, this database will be removed. In case you would like to run all tests in a specific database, you need to provide the URI of the database yourself.

If you want to use a [Postgresql database](https://www.postgresql.org/), read the DEVELOPMENT documentation
how to set it up.
