3,"Recommendations for a Standardized Avian Coronavirus (AvCoV) Nomenclature: Outcome from Discussions Within the Framework of the European Union COST Action FA1207: ""Towards Control of Avian Coronaviruses: Strategies for Vaccination, Diagnosis and Surveillance""","Viruses within the Coronaviridae family show variations within their genome sequences, especially within the major structural protein, the Spike (S) glycoprotein gene. Therefore, many different antigenic forms, serotypes, or variant strains of avian coronaviruses (AvCoV) exist worldwide. Only a few of them, the so called protectotypes, cross protect against different serotypes. New serotypes arise by recombination or spontaneous mutations. From time to time, antigenic virus variants appear which differ significantly from known serotypes. The result of this variability is an inconsistent nomenclature and classification of virus strains. Furthermore, there are currently no standard classification methods defined. Within the framework of the COST Action FA1207 ""Towards control of avian coronaviruses: strategies for diagnosis, surveillance, and vaccination"" (working groups ""Molecular virology"" and ""Epidemiology""), we aimed at defining and developing a unified and internationally standardized nomenclature and classification of AvCoVs. We recommend the use of ""CoV Genus/AvCov/host/country/specimen id/year"" to refer to AvCoV strains.",animal;bird disease;classification;Coronaviridae;Coronaviridae infection;nomenclature;veterinary medicine;virology,,2016.0,,10.1637/0005-2086-60.2.411,0

5,"Genotyping the isolates of bovine leukemia virus, circulating in the stavropol territory","The bovine leukemia virus (BLV) circulating on the territory of the Stavropol Territory of Russia is characterized according to the modern classification of subspecies membership. Proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of BLV has been separated out of the peripheral blood of animals that had been naturally infected with this virus. Subsequent amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a fragment of the env-gene with the length of 444 pairs of nucleotides (p.n.) made it possible to classify the studied isolates as genotypes 4 and 6. Besides, we have separated out the BLV isolate located apart from clusters of isolates of all eight known genotypes, which made it possible to classify it as atypical. In course of sequencing a section of the env gene of BLV provirus isolates separatedin this area, the presence of 31 point mutation in the studied locus has been detected, with 11 of them being significant: 2 transversions and 9 transitions.",virus DNA;virus envelope protein;article;Bovine leukemia virus;Bovine leukemia virus genotype 4;Bovine leukemia virus genotype 6;controlled study;envelope gene;gene amplification;gene locus;gene sequence;genotype;mutational analysis;nonhuman;phylogenetic tree;point mutation;Russian Federation;sequence analysis;virus gene;virus isolation,"Abakin, S.

6,"Identification and phylogentic analysis of sheep pox during an outbreak of sheep in Sharkia governorate, Egypt","Sheeppox virus (SPPV) is one of the listed and notifiable disease affect sheep production with major effect on the trade of new breed of sheep. This study was conducted to identify sheep pox by using cell culture, electron microscope (EM) and open reading frame (ORF) 103 gene during an outbreak of local breed of sheep occurred in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt in April 2017. Affected adult sheep showed typical skin pox lesion on face, the inner side of lips, inner aspect of the thigh and under the tail. The incidence rate of infection was 23.5% and the mortality rate in young lambs aged 3 to 6 months old was 8.2%. Forty-three scabs and tissue samples from clinically diseased adult sheep and dead lambs were collected and subjected to culture on Vero cell. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed within 3 to 7 days in 40 samples. A typical Poxvirus was a brick-like shape with round ends by negative staining of EM and ovoid like structure with dumb-bell shaped DNA core with concave bodies sides by positive staining of EM. By conventional PCR utilizing ORF103 gene and obtained bands of about 570 bp referred to SPPV. The sequence amplicon was analyzed by NCBI-BLAST and register in GeneBank under accession N. MG873537 and phylogentic tree was designed which revealed that the isolated strain of SPPV was resembled with other strains of SPPV isolated in Egypt, India, China, and USA. Finally, both EM and PCR are considered as sensitives, rapids, and powerful methods to identify SPPV from tissue and scab’s samples without the need of further culture in addition to the useful and easily use of ORF103 gene to differentiate SPPV from other Capripoxvirus.",adult;amplicon;animal tissue;article;Capripoxvirus;cell culture;controlled study;cytopathogenic effect;Egypt;electron microscopy;epidemic;incidence;infection rate;mortality rate;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;ORF103 gene;phylogeny;polymerase chain reaction;sequence analysis;sheeppox;virus gene;virus morphology,"Abd-Elfatah, E.

7,Isolation and Molecular Characterization of Novel Infectious Bronchitis Virus Variants from Vaccinated Broiler Flocks in Egypt,"The present study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics of circulating infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains in vaccinated broiler flocks in the Giza and Fayoum governorates. Thirty-four isolates were collected, and egg propagation revealed their ability to induce typical IBV lesions after three to five successive passages. Three selected isolates were identified as IBV using a real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assay targeted the nucleocapsid (N) gene and further characterized by partial spike (S) gene sequence analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed their clustering into two variant groups. Group I consisted of one variant (VSVRI_F3), which had 99.1% nucleotide sequence identity to the Q1 reference strain. Group II consisted of variants VSVRI_G4 and VSVRI_G9, which showed 92.8%-94.3% nucleotide identity with the Egyptian variants Eg/12120S/2012, Eg/12197B/2012, and Eg/1265B/2012. Regarding the deduced amino acid sequence, the three variants had 77.1%-85.2% similarity with the vaccine strains currently used in Egypt. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring the prevalence of IBV variants in vaccinated broiler flocks as well as adopting an appropriate vaccination strategy.","coronavirus spike glycoprotein;nucleocapsid protein;nucleocapsid protein, Coronavirus;amino acid sequence;animal;Avian infectious bronchitis virus;bird disease;chemistry;chicken;Coronavirus infection;Egypt;genetic variation;genetics;isolation and purification;metabolism;phylogeny;real time polymerase chain reaction;veterinary medicine;virology","Abdel-Sabour, M.

8,"Retrotransposable elements on the W chromosome of the silkworm, Bombyx mori","The sex chromosomes of the silkworm, Bombyxmori, are designated ZW(XY) for females and ZZ(XX) for males. The W chromosome of B. mori does not recombine with the Z chromosome and autosomes and no genes for morphological characters have been mapped to the W chromosome as yet. Furthermore, femaleness is determined by the presence of a single W chromosome, regardless of the number of autosomes or Z chromosomes. To understand these interesting features of the W chromosome, it is necessary to analyze the W chromosome at the molecular biology level. Initially to isolate DNA sequences specific for the W chromosome as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, we compared the genomic DNAs between males and females by PCR with arbitrary 10-mer primers. To the present, we have identified 12 W-specific RAPD markers, and with the exception of one RAPD marker, all of the deduced amino acid sequences of these W-specific RAPD markers show similarity to previously reported amino acid sequences of retrotransposable elements from various organisms. After constructing a genomic DNA lambda phage library of B. mori we obtained two lambda phage clones, one containing the W-Kabuki RAPD sequence and one containing the W-Samurai RAPD sequence and found that these DNA sequences comprised nested structures of many retrotransposable elements. To further analyze the W chromosome, we obtained 14 W-specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from three BAC libraries and subjected these clones to shotgun sequencing. The resulting assembly of sequences did not produce a single contiguous sequence due to the presence of many retrotransposable elements. Therefore, we coupled PCR with shotgun sequencing. Through these analyses, we found that many long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons, retroposons, DNA transposons and their derivatives, have accumulated on the W chromosome as strata. These results strongly indicate that retrotransposable elements are the main structural component of the W chromosome.","Animals;Bacteriophage lambda/ge [Genetics];Bacteriophage lambda/ip [Isolation & Purification];*Bombyx/ge [Genetics];Bombyx/vi [Virology];*Chromosome Mapping;Female;Insect Proteins/ge [Genetics];Male;Models, Genetic;Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique;*Retroelements;*Sex Chromosomes;0 (Insect Proteins);0 (Retroelements)","Abe, H.;Mita, K.;Yasukochi, Y.;Oshiki, T.;Shimada, T.",2005.0,,,0
9,A novel sapelovirus-like virus isolation from wild boar,"A novel sapelovirus-like virus was isolated from a wild boar (Sus scrofa). In this study, partial viral genomic nucleotide sequences were determined using the rapid determination system of viral nucleic acid sequences (RDV) ver. 3.1, which we recently developed for discovering novel viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 and 3A proteins and their encoding nucleotide sequences of enteroviruses and sapeloviruses indicated that the isolated virus was closely related to porcine sapelovirus.

10,Genomic and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of infectious bronchitis coronavirus,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gammacoronavirus that causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens. A QX-like strain was analysed by high-throughput Illumina sequencing and genetic variation across the entire viral genome was explored at the sub-consensus level by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) in the order 5'-UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3'UTR were predicted. The relative frequencies of missense: silent SNPs were calculated to obtain a comparative measure of variability in specific genes. The most variable ORFs in descending order were E, 3b, 5'UTR, N, 1a, S, 1ab, M, 4c, 5a, 6b. The E and 3b protein products play key roles in coronavirus virulence, and RNA folding demonstrated that the mutations in the 5'UTR did not alter the predicted secondary structure. The frequency of SNPs in the Spike (S) protein ORF of 0.67% was below the genomic average of 0.76%. Only three SNPS were identified in the S1 subunit, none of which were located in hypervariable region (HVR) 1 or HVR2. The S2 subunit was considerably more variable containing 87% of the polymorphisms detected across the entire S protein. The S2 subunit also contained a previously unreported multi-A insertion site and a stretch of four consecutive mutated amino acids, which mapped to the stalk region of the spike protein. Template-based protein structure modelling produced the first theoretical model of the IBV spike monomer. Given the lack of diversity observed at the sub-consensus level, the tenet that the HVRs in the S1 subunit are very tolerant of amino acid changes produced by genetic drift is questioned.",amino acid;virus spike protein;3' untranslated region;5' untranslated region;amino acid substitution;animal tissue;article;Avian infectious bronchitis virus;chicken;controlled study;Coronavirinae;gene insertion;genetic drift;genetic variability;genomics;high throughput screening;missense mutation;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;open reading frame;priority journal;protein secondary structure;protein structure;protein subunit;respiratory tract disease;RNA folding;single nucleotide polymorphism;theoretical model;virus genome;virus strain;virus virulence,"Abolnik, C.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.033,0
11,Evolution of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza: sequence data indicate stepwise changes in the cleavage site,"The genetic composition of an H5 subtype hemagglutinin gene quasispecies, obtained from ostrich tissues that had been infected with H5 subtype influenza virus was analysed using a next generation sequencing approach. The first evidence for the reiterative copying of a poly (U) stretch in the connecting peptide region in the haemagglutinin cleavage site (HACS) by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is provided. Multiple non-consensus species of RNA were detected in the infected host, corresponding to likely intermediate sequences between the putative low pathogenic precursor nucleotide sequence of the H5 influenza strain and the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus gene sequence. In silico analysis of the identified RNA sequences predicted that the intermediary H5 sequence PQREKRGLF plays an important role in subsequent mutational events that relocate the HACS coding region from stable base-paired RNA regions to a single-stranded bulge, thereby priming the connecting peptide coding region for RdRp slippage.","hemagglutinin, avian influenza A virus;Influenza virus hemagglutinin;RNA directed RNA polymerase;virus RNA;animal;avian influenza;genetics;high throughput sequencing;human;influenza;Influenza A virus (H5N1);isolation and purification;poultry;virology","Abolnik, C.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3337-x,0
12,Outbreaks of avian influenza H6N2 viruses in chickens arose by a reassortment of H6N8 and H9N2 ostrich viruses,"The first recorded outbreak of avian influenza (AI) in South African chickens (low pathogenicity H6N2) occurred at Camperdown, KwaZulu/Natal Province (KZN) in June 2002. To determine the source of the outbreak, we defined the phylogenetic relationships between various H6N2 isolates, and the previously unpublished gene sequences of an H6N8 virus isolated in 1998 from ostriches in the Leeu Gamka region (A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98). We demonstrated that two distinct genetic H6N2 lineages (sub-lineages I and II) circulated in the Camperdown area, which later spread to other regions. Sub-lineages I and II shared a recent common H6N2 ancestor, which arose from a reassortment event between two South African ostrich isolates A/Ostrich/South Africa/9508103/95 and (H9N2) A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98 (H6N8). Furthermore, the H6N2 sub-lineage I viruses had several molecular genetic markers including a 22-amino acid stalk deletion in the neuraminidase (NA) protein gene, a predicted increased N-glycosylation, and a D144 mutation of the HA protein gene, all of which are associated with the adaptation of AI viruses to chickens. The H6N2 NS1 and PB1 genes shared recent common ancestors with those of contemporary Asian HPAI H5N1 viruses. Our results suggest that ostriches are potential mixing vessels for avian influenza viruses (AIV) outbreak strains and support other reports that H6 viruses are capable of forming stable lineages in chickens. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",amino acid;gene product;sialidase;article;avian influenza;chicken;controlled study;evolutionary adaptation;gene deletion;gene sequence;genetic line;genetic marker;genetic reassortment;glycosylation;H6N2 virus;Influenza virus;molecular genetics;mutation;nonhuman;ostrich;phylogeny;priority journal;South Africa;virus isolation;virus strain,"Abolnik, C.;Bisschop, S.;Gerdes, T.;Olivier, A.;Horner, R.",2007.0,,10.1007/s11262-006-0007-6,0
13,Phylogenetic analysis of low-pathogenicity avian influenza H6N2 viruses from chicken outbreaks (2001-2005) suggest that they are reassortants of historic ostrich low-pathogenicity avian influenza H9N2 and H6N8 viruses,"Low-pathogenicity (LPAI) and high-pathogenicity (HPAI) avian influenza viruses are periodically isolated from South African ostriches, but during 2002 the first recorded outbreak of LPAI (H6N2) in South African chickens occurred on commercial farms in the Camperdown area of KwaZulu/Natal (KZN) Province. Sequence analysis of all eight genes were performed and phylogenetic analysis was done based on the hemagglutinin and neuraminidasc sequences. Results from phylogenetic analyses indicated that the H6N2 chicken viruses most likely arose from a reassortment between two South African LPAI ostrich isolates: an H9N2 virus isolated in 1995 and an H6N8 virus isolated in 1998. Two cocirculating sublineages of H6N2 viruses were detected, both sharing a recent common ancestor. One of these sublineages was restricted to the KZN province. The neuraminidase gene contained a 22-amino acid deletion in the NA-stalk region, which is associated with adaptation to growth in chickens, whereas the other group, although lacking the NA-stalk deletion, spread to commercial farms in other provinces. The persistence of particular H6N2 types in some regions for at least 2 yr supports reports from Asia and southern California suggesting that H6N2 viruses can form stable lineages in chickens. It is probable that the ostrich H6N8 and H9N2 progenitors of the chicken H6N2 viruses were introduced to ostriches by wild birds. Ostriches, in which AI infections are often subclinical, may serve as mixing vessels for LPAI strains that occasionally spill over into other poultry.",hemagglutinin;animal;animal disease;avian influenza;chicken;conference paper;epidemic;genetic reassortment;genetics;Influenza A virus;nucleotide sequence;ostrich;pathogenicity;phylogeny;South Africa;virology,"Abolnik, C.;Bisschop, S.

14,Full genomic sequence of an African avian paramyxovirus type 4 strain isolated from a wild duck,"A random amplification/deep sequencing approach was applied to determine the complete genomic sequence of an Avian Paramyxovirus Type 4 (APMV-4) strain isolated from a wild duck in South Africa in 2010. This sequence represents the fourth full genome of APMV-4 in public sequence databases and the first for the African continent. A total of 87,402,081 Illumina paired-end reads were obtained of which 47,338,867 (54.16 %) mapped to the reference genome EU877976. The entire genomic sequence of 15,054 nt, including the intact termini, was recovered at a high redundancy (coverage per base: average = 198,861.06, minimum = 52 and maximum = 1,790,889). Pairwise comparison of full genomic nucleotide sequences indicated that APMV-4/Egyptian goose/South Africa/N1468/10 shared 97.3 % sequence identity with APMV-4/KR/YJ/06, 96.4 % sequence identity with APMV-4/mallard/Belgium/15129/07 and 90.8 % nucleotide sequence identity with APMV-4/duck/HK/D3/75. Genomic features were consistent with previously sequenced viruses including predicted open reading frames for the NP, P, F and L genes, but variations in coding regions for the M and HN genes were identified. The sequencing approach adopted in this study could successfully indicate quasispecies in the viral stock.","Alleles;Animals;Avulavirus/ge [Genetics];*Avulavirus/ip [Isolation & Purification];Avulavirus/py [Pathogenicity];*Avulavirus Infections/ve [Veterinary];Avulavirus Infections/vi [Virology];Base Sequence;Chromosome Mapping;Databases, Genetic;*Ducks/vi [Virology];Gene Frequency;Gene Library;*Genome, Viral;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Open Reading Frames;Phosphoproteins/ge [Genetics];Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid;South Africa;Viral Proteins/ge [Genetics];0 (L protein, paramyxoviridae);0 (P protein, Sendai virus);0 (Phosphoproteins);0 (Viral Proteins)","Abolnik, C.;de Castro, M.;Rees, J.",2012.0,Dec,,0
15,Characterization of pigeon paramyxoviruses (Newcastle disease virus) isolated in South Africa from 2001 to 2006,"Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), a variant of Newcastle disease virus that primarily affects doves and pigeons has been isolated in South Africa since the mid-1980s. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 viruses were introduced into South Africa on multiple occasions, based on the presence of two separate lineages, 4bi and 4bii, that have been circulating in Europe and the Far East since the early 1990s. During 2006, a PPMV-1 virus was isolated from an African ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri) which became acutely infected with PPMV-1 and died, probably after scavenging off infected dove carcasses in the region, since a closely-related PPMV-1 strain was also isolated from doves collected nearby. The hornbill isolate had ICPI and MDT values characteristic of PPMV-1 strains. The threat of PPMV-1 to poultry production and biodiversity in southern Africa highlights the importance of monitoring the spread of this strain.",virus RNA;amino acid sequence;animal;animal disease;article;bird disease;classification;disease transmission;food chain;isolation and purification;molecular genetics;Newcastle disease virus;pathogenicity;phylogeny;Columbidae;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;sequence alignment;South Africa;species difference;virology,"Abolnik, C.;Gerdes, G.

16,Characterisation of a highly pathogenic influenza A virus of subtype H5N2 isolated from ostriches in South Africa in 2004,"Objectives: The HPAI H5N2 strain that caused an outbreak in ostriches of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa in 2004 was characterized. Design: Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were performed on sera from ostrich farms in the outbreak region, and intravenous pathogenicity (IVPI) tests, reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR), nucleic acid sequencing and phylogenetic comparisons were performed on the HPAI H5N2 virus isolated during the outbreak. Results: The deduced amino acid sequence at the HA0 cleavage site determined by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing was PQREKRRKKRGLF and thus the virus fell within the definition of a highly pathogenic virus, but in an IVPI test in chickens on the virus isolated from the index case and a value of 0.63 was recorded, which is below the criterion for highly pathogenic viruses in this in vivo test. After a further passage in embryonated eggs a second IVPI was carried out and an elevated value of 1.19 was obtained. Cloacal swabs were taken from the initial IVPI birds, inoculated into embryonated chickens eggs and a third IVPI was then performed on the resulting haemagglutinating, infective allantoic fluid. An index of 2.73 was recorded. Conclusions: HI tests appeared to be the more sensitive test compared to AGID when testing for antibodies to avian influenza in sera. An ostrich-derived virus with a virulent HA0 cleavage site was not initially virulent in chickens but after passage in the latter the virulence increased.

17,Complete genome sequence of a velogenic newcastle disease virus isolated in Mexico,"In Mexico, the number of cases of the highly virulent Newcastle disease virus is increasing. In 2005, an outbreak of Newcastle disease occurred on an egg laying hen farm in the state of Puebla despite vaccination with the LaSota strain. Farmers experienced a major drop in egg production as a consequence of a field challenge virus. In this study, we characterize the virus, APMV1/chicken/ Mexico/P05/2005, responsible for the outbreak. The virus is categorized as a velogenic virus with an intracranial pathogenicity index of 1.99 and a chicken embryo mean death time of 36 h. The complete genome length of the virus was sequenced as consisting of 15,192 bp. In addition, phylogenetic analysis classified the virus as a member of the class II, genotype V. The highly pathogenic nature of the virus has been linked to the amino acid sequence at the fusion protein cleavage site, which contains multiple basic amino acids (RRQKR;F). © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",amino acid;fusion protein;agricultural worker;amino acid sequence;animal cell;animal tissue;article;controlled study;egg production;embryo;gene sequence;genotype;Mexico;Newcastle disease;Newcastle disease virus;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;pathotype;phylogeny;priority journal;protein cleavage;vaccination;velogenic virus;virus;virus genome;virus isolation;virus strain;virus virulence,"Absalón, A.

18,Avian infuenza: Global assessment of potential pandemic of the twenty first century,"The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of Asian lineage and the subsequent spillover to other part of the globe and on going spread of Eurasian-Africa H5N1 epidemic into domestic, wild birds and human have generated unprecedented attention in recent times and threat of potential pandemic via the avian-human link. Historically, from 1878 through 1955, fowl plaque was described as a high mortality disease of poultry in many countries throughout Europe, Asia, North and South America and Africa and the etiology was proved to be a filterable virus. In the 1930s through the 1950s, fowl plaque disappeared as an endemic disease in most part of the world. In 1949, the first report of a low virulent disease in chickens caused by LPAI virus was reported. In 1955, the etiological of fowl plaque was determined to be influenza A virus, which subsequently was identified as the H7 subtype. In 1959, a ""fowl plaque-like"" outbreak was described in chickens, which was the first report of fowl plaque caused by a non-H7 AI virus, i.e. first fowl plaque outbreak from H5 subtype of AI virus. In 1961 the first wild birds infection and deaths were reported in common terns of South Africa. In 1966 and 1971, the first H5 and H7 LPAI viruses, respectively were identified; prior to this period, only HPAI viruses had H5 and H7 subtypes. In 1970, the AGID serological test was introduced, which allowed easy and rapid identification of AI virus-infected poultry flocks. In 1972, there was the first isolation of LPAI viruses in asymptomatic wild birds: ducks in the United State and shorebirds in Australia. In 1981, the term ""highly pathogenic avian influenza"" was accepted as standard nomenclature for fowl plaque and related synonyms. In 1983, LPAI virus was observed mutating to HPAI virus during LPAI field outbreak, and specific genomic changes were identified in the proteolytic cleavage site of the hemagglutinin responsible for the virulence change. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, molecular criteria were added to the definition for classifying an AI virus as HPAI. In 2002, there were the first reported infections and deaths in a wide variety of wild bird species from AI virus H5N1 HPAI virus.

19,Phylogenetic and molecular characterization of coronavirus affecting species of bovine and birds in cuba,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are pathogens of veterinary importance that affect birds and bovine in Cuba; however, molecular characteristics and genetic diversity of these viruses are unknown. This study was aimed at determining the molecular characteristics and genetic diversity of both agents, based in the spike S gene. A molecular analysis was carried out from fi eld strains of BCoV collected between 2009 and 2011 and phylogenetic studies were conducted using partial or complete S gene sequences as phylogenetic markers. Besides, studies of phylogenetic inference were carried out in S1 region of recent isolates of IBV. All Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were located in a single cluster supported by 100 % bootstrap and 1.00 posterior probability values. The Cuban BCoV sequences were also clustered with the USA BCoV strains corresponding to the GenBank accession numbers EF424621 and EF424623, suggesting a common origin for these viruses. This phylogenetic cluster was also the only group of sequences in which no recombination events were detected. Of the 45 amino acid changes found in the Cuban strains, four were unique. On the other hand, two putative genotypes genetically different to the Massachusetts genotype H120 strain used in the Cuban vaccination program were found in the fl ocks assessed. In addition, a potential nephropathogenic IBV isolate was found by fi rst time in Cuba.

20,Viromic Analysis of Wastewater Input to a River Catchment Reveals a Diverse Assemblage of RNA Viruses,"Detection of viruses in the environment is heavily dependent on PCR-based approaches that require reference sequences for primer design. While this strategy can accurately detect known viruses, it will not find novel genotypes or emerging and invasive viral species. In this study, we investigated the use of viromics, i.e., high-throughput sequencing of the biosphere's viral fraction, to detect human-/animal-pathogenic RNA viruses in the Conwy river catchment area in Wales, United Kingdom. Using a combination of filtering and nuclease treatment, we extracted the viral fraction from wastewater and estuarine river water and sediment, followed by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis on the Illumina HiSeq platform, for the discovery of RNA virus genomes. We found a higher richness of RNA viruses in wastewater samples than in river water and sediment, and we assembled a complete norovirus genotype GI.2 genome from wastewater effluent, which was not contemporaneously detected by conventional reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The simultaneous presence of diverse rotavirus signatures in wastewater indicated the potential for zoonotic infections in the area and suggested runoff from pig farms as a possible origin of these viruses. Our results show that viromics can be an important tool in the discovery of pathogenic viruses in the environment and can be used to inform and optimize reference-based detection methods provided appropriate and rigorous controls are included. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Enteric viruses cause gastrointestinal illness and are commonly transmitted through the fecal-oral route. When wastewater is released into river systems, these viruses can contaminate the environment. Our results show that we can use viromics to find the range of potentially pathogenic viruses that are present in the environment and identify prevalent genotypes. The ultimate goal is to trace the fate of these pathogenic viruses from origin to the point where they are a threat to human health, informing reference-based detection methods and water quality management.",,"Adriaenssens, E.

21,Prevalence of porcine parvoviruses in some South African swine herds with background of porcine circovirus type 2 infection,"The classical porcine parvovirus is an important pathogen of reproductive disorders in pigs with a confirmed history of global distribution. The detection of many novel porcine parvoviruses has however been on the increase for the past few years, but there is a dearth of information on the occurrence and prevalence of these viruses in South Africa. Molecular detection of some known parvoviruses, namely porcine parvoviruses (PPVs) - 1, 2, 3 and 4, porcine bocavirus-like virus (PBo-likeV) and porcine bocaviruses (PBoV1/2), was carried out from 110 randomly selected archived swine samples collected in the year 2015 and 2016. Samples were drawn from previously screened and confirmed porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infected farms, with farm-level occurrence ranged from 5.6 to 60%. The findings showed that all the screened parvoviruses were present as follows: PPV1 (29.1%), PPV2 (21.8%), PPV3 (5.5%), PPV4 (43.6%), PBo-likeV (21.8%) and PBoV1/2 (44.6%). The frequency of double infections of the viruses was as high as 18.2% of PPV2/PPV4 and PPV4/PBoVs; while 17.3% and 7.3% of the screened samples showed multiple infections of the three and four viruses respectively. Further phylogenetic analyses of partial PPV1, 2 and PBoV1/2 sequences showed two major clades for each of the viruses. This study reports the first epidemiological survey and molecular characterisation of the classical and emerging porcine parvoviruses in South African swine herds. It also gives insights into the diversity and distribution of these viral pathogens within the herds of the study area and confirms their co-infection potentials with PCV2.",article;Bocaparvovirus;Circoviridae infection;gene sequence;herd;mixed infection;nonhuman;parvovirus infection;phylogeny;pig;Porcine bocavirus 1;Porcine bocavirus 2;Porcine bocavirus like virus;Porcine circovirus 2;Porcine parvovirus;Porcine parvovirus 1;Porcine parvovirus 2;Porcine parvovirus 3;Porcine parvovirus 4;prevalence;South Africa,"Afolabi, K.

22,Biological characterization and next-generation genome sequencing of the unclassified cotia virus SPAn232 (Poxviridae),"Cotia virus (COTV) SPAn232 was isolated in 1961 from sentinel mice at Cotia field station, São Paulo, Brazil. Attempts to classify COTV within a recognized genus of the Poxviridae have generated contradictory findings. Studies by different researchers suggested some similarity to myxoma virus and swinepox virus, whereas another investigation characterized COTV SPAn232 as a vaccinia virus strain. Because of the lack of consensus, we have conducted an independent biological and molecular characterization of COTV. Virus growth curves reached maximum yields at approximately 24 to 48 h and were accompanied by virus DNA replication and a characteristic early/late pattern of viral protein synthesis. Interestingly, COTV did not induce detectable cytopathic effects in BSC-40 cells until 4 days postinfection and generated viral plaques only after 8 days. We determined the complete genomic sequence of COTV by using a combination of the next-generation DNA sequencing technologies 454 and Illumina. A unique contiguous sequence of 185,139 bp containing 185 genes, including the 90 genes conserved in all chordopoxviruses, was obtained. COTV has an interesting panel of open reading frames (ORFs) related to the evasion of host defense, including two novel genes encoding C-C chemokine-like proteins, each present in duplicate copies. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the highest amino acid identity scores with Cervidpoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Suipoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, and Yatapoxvirus. However, COTV grouped as an independent branch within this clade, which clearly excluded its classification as an Orthopoxvirus. Therefore, our data suggest that COTV could represent a new poxvirus genus. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",animal cell;article;Capripoxvirus;Cervidpoxvirus;Chordopoxvirinae;Cotia virus;cytopathogenic effect;DNA replication;DNA sequence;host range;human;human cell;immune evasion;Leporipoxvirus;molecular phylogeny;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;open reading frame;Orthopovirus;Poxviridae;priority journal;protein synthesis;Suipoxvirus;virogenesis;virus classification;virus gene;virus genome;virus morphology;virus plaque;virus replication,"Afonso, P.

23,"Lumpy skin disease outbreaks in Greece during 2015–16, implementation of emergency immunization and genetic differentiation between field isolates and vaccine virus strains","The objective of this study is to present epizootiological data from the lumpy skin disease (LSD) outbreaks in Greece during 2015–16, following the implementation of emergency vaccination and total stamping-out, along with laboratory data regarding the genetic differentiation between field isolates and live attenuated vaccine virus strains. Descriptive geographical chronology analysis was conducted to present the progressive shift of the outbreaks westwards, and at the same time, the absence of further outbreaks in previously affected regional units where high vaccination coverage was achieved. Isolation and molecular characterization of LSDV from the first recorded case in Greece (Evros/GR/15 isolate) was performed. The two live attenuated LSD vaccine viruses, currently used for emergency immunization in Greece, were sequenced and compared to the Evros/GR/15 isolate, in 3 genomic regions (GPCR gene, RPO30 gene, and partial LSDV126/LSDV127 genes). Sequence comparisons revealed prominent differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate and the vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis resulted in the classification of the Evros/GR/15 isolate in the same clade with all field LSDV isolates, whereas vaccine strains were grouped in a distinct cluster within the LSDV clade. Additional samples from animals presenting skin nodules (N = 13) were characterized by sequencing in the 3 aforementioned genomic regions. Among them, in 5 animals that were vaccinated, the attenuated vaccine virus was identified. A PCR-RFLP method targeting the LSDV127 gene was developed and proved to be able to discriminate between the characterized field and vaccine strains. The findings of the present study substantiate the importance of timely and intensive vaccinations for the control of LSDV epizootic and the genetic differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate and the vaccine strains. This provides the basis for the development of PCR-based DIVA assays, which would be of major importance for effective disease surveillance and stamping-out during LSD vaccination campaigns.",live vaccine;lumpy skin disease virus vaccine;restriction endonuclease;unclassified drug;virus vaccine;analysis;animal tissue;article;bovine;cladistics;controlled study;emergency care;epidemic;gene cluster;gene sequence;genetic difference;GPCR gene;Greece;LSDV126 gene;LSDV127 gene;lumpy skin disease;Lumpy skin disease virus;nonhuman;phylogeny;polymerase chain reaction;restriction fragment length polymorphism;restriction site;RPO30 gene;sequence analysis;skin nodule;strain difference;vaccination;virus gene;virus isolation;virus strain;lumpyvax,"Agianniotaki, E.

24,Spread of the newly emerging infectious laryngotracheitis viruses in Australia,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a significant viral disease of chickens in many countries around the globe. In this report the status of ILT in Australia has been used as a model to evaluate the evolution of the ILT viruses (ILTVs). Due to its geographical isolation, Australia harbored a distinct lineage of ILT viruses (ILTV) up to 2007. However examination of the ILT viruses (ILTV) involved in outbreaks between 2007 and 2009 has revealed that many of the outbreaks were caused by two new viral genotypes, class 8 and class 9. These two recombinant viruses were found to emerge as a result of recombination between previously existing live vaccine strains (SA2 and A20), and another live vaccine strain (Serva) introduced into the country in 2007. The new recombinant ILTVs were also shown to possess significantly higher virulence and replication capacity compared with a previously predominant ILTV, class 2. In the current study, examination of a large number of ILTVs isolated from outbreaks between 2009 and 2015 revealed the emergence of yet another recombinant virus (class 10) that appears to have become a predominant genotype in New South Wales. In Victoria however, the recombinant class 9 gradually became the predominant virus, replacing class 2. Therefore, there was an unusual pattern in geographical spread of the newly emerged viruses in different states of the country. These results suggest that ILTV is fast evolving towards a greater transmissibility and therefore greater capacity to spread into ILTV-free areas.","Animals;Australia/ep [Epidemiology];*Chickens/vi [Virology];Gene Transfer, Horizontal;*Herpesviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology];*Herpesviridae Infections/ve [Veterinary];Herpesviridae Infections/vi [Virology];*Herpesvirus 1, Gallid/cl [Classification];Herpesvirus 1, Gallid/ge [Genetics];Herpesvirus 1, Gallid/ip [Isolation & Purification];High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/ve [Veterinary];Phylogeny;Poultry Diseases/ep [Epidemiology];*Poultry Diseases/vi [Virology];Sequence Analysis, DNA/ve [Veterinary];Virulence;Virus Replication","Agnew-Crumpton, R.;Vaz, P.

25,Detection and phylogenetic analysis of Orf virus in Kashmir Himalayas,"Orf virus (ORFV) is a zoonotic pathogen that primarily infects sheep and goats, and is responsible for significant economic losses. ORFV is endemic in all the major sheep and goat rearing areas of the world including Indian subcontinent. However, the nature of ORFV circulating among sheep and goat in Kashmir Himalayas has not yet been characterized. In the present study, we describe natural outbreaks of ORFV in sheep and goats of Kashmir Himalayas. We detected the presence of ORFV in the scab lesion by PCR amplification of the major envelope protein (B2L) gene. We sequenced the virus interferon resistance (VIR) gene and determined their phylogenetic relationship with that of the published reference sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on VIR gene revealed that the ORFV isolates from Kashmir Himalayas separated into main two clusters. The sheep isolates showed genetic homology with the sheep strains reported from Greece and Italy, whereas the goat-specific strain show homology with the goat strains reported from China. This study demonstrates the presence of ORFV infection in sheep and goats, and report first phylogenetic analysis of the ORFV strains prevalent in the Kashmir Himalayas.",antiviral activity;article;bluetongue;Capripoxvirus;contagious ecthyma;DNA base composition;endemic disease;foot and mouth disease;gene sequence;genetic variation;Greece;Italy;lamb;molecular epidemiology;morbidity;nonhuman;Orf virus;phylogenetic tree;phylogeny;prevalence;pyoderma gangrenosum;sequence alignment;virus replication;virus virulence,"Ahanger, S.

26,"Host-parasite relations of bacteria and phages can be unveiled by Oligostickiness, a measure of relaxed sequence similarity","Motivation: The recent metagenome analysis has been producing a large number of host-unassigned viruses. Although assigning viruses to their hosts is basically important not only for virology but also for prevention of epidemic, it has been a laborious and difficult task to date. The only effective method for this purpose has been to find them in a same microscopic view. Now, we tried a computational approach based on genome sequences of bacteria and phages, introducing a physicochemical parameter, SOSS (set of oligostickiness similarity score) derived from oligostickiness, a measure of binding affinity of oligonucleotides to template DNA. Results: We could confirm host-parasite relationships of bacteria and their phages by SOSS analysis: all phages tested (25 species) had a remarkably higher SOSS value with its host than with unrelated bacteria. Interestingly, according to SOSS values, lysogenic phages such as lambda phage (host: Escherichia coli) or SPP1 (host: Bacillus subtilis) have distinctively higher similarity with its host than its non-lysogenic (excretive or virulent) ones such as fd and T4 (host: E. coli) or phages gamma and PZA (host: B.subtilis). This finding is very promising for assigning host-unknown viruses to its host. We also investigated the relationship in codon usage frequency or G + C content of genomes to interpret the phenomenon revealed by SOSS analysis, obtaining evidences which support the hypothesis that higher SOSS values resulted from the cohabitation in the same environment which may cause the common biased mutation. Thus, lysogenic phages which stay inside longer resemble the host. © The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.

27,Genetic diversity and comparison of diagnostic tests for characterization of foot-and-mouth disease virus strains from Pakistan 2008–2012,"We report the laboratory analysis of 125 clinical samples from suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in cattle and Asian buffalo collected in Pakistan between 2008 and 2012. Of these samples, 89 were found to contain viral RNA by rRT-PCR, of which 88 were also found to contain infectious FMD virus (FMDV) by virus isolation (VI), with strong correlation between these tests (κ = 0.96). Samples that were VI-positive were serotyped by antigen detection ELISA (Ag-ELISA) and VP1 sequence acquisition and analysis. Sequence data identified FMDV serotypes A (n = 13), O (n = 36) and Asia-1 (n = 41), including three samples from which both serotypes Asia-1 and O were detected. Serotype A viruses were classified within three different Iran-05 sublineages: HER-10, FAR-11 and ESF-10. All serotype Asia-1 were within Group VII (Sindh-08 lineage), in a genetic clade that differs from viruses isolated prior to 2010. All serotypes O were classified as PanAsia-2 within two different sublineages: ANT-10 and BAL-09. Using VP1 sequencing as the gold standard for serotype determination, the overall sensitivity of Ag-ELISA to correctly determine serotype was 74%, and serotype-specific sensitivity was 8% for serotype A, 88% for Asia-1 and 89% for O. Serotype-specific specificity was 100% for serotype A, 93% for Asia-1 and 94% for O. Interestingly, 12 of 13 serotype A viruses were not detected by Ag-ELISA. This study confirms earlier accounts of regional genetic diversity of FMDV in Pakistan and highlights the importance of continued validation of diagnostic tests for rapidly evolving pathogens such as FMDV.",article;diagnostic test;enzyme linked immunosorbent assay;foot and mouth disease;genetic variability;human;Pakistan;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;screening test;virus detection;virus isolation,"Ahmed, Z.;Pauszek, S.

29,Complete genome analysis of porcine kobuviruses from the feces of pigs in Japan,"Porcine kobuviruses (PoKoVs) are ubiquitously distributed in pig populations worldwide and are thought to be enteric viruses in swine. Although PoKoVs have been detected in pigs in Japan, no complete genome data for Japanese PoKoVs are available. In the present study, 24 nearly complete or complete sequences of the PoKoV genome obtained from 10 diarrheic feces and 14 non-diarrheic feces of Japanese pigs were analyzed using a metagenomics approach. Japanese PoKoVs shared 85.2–100% identity with the complete coding nucleotide (nt) sequences and the closest relationship of 85.1–98.3% with PoKoVs from other countries. Twenty of 24 Japanese PoKoVs carried a deletion of 90 nt in the 2B coding region. Phylogenetic tree analyses revealed that PoKoVs were not grouped according to their geographical region of origin and the phylogenetic trees of the L, P1, P2, and P3 genetic regions showed topologies different from each other. Similarity plot analysis using strains from a single farm revealed partially different similarity patterns among strains from identical farm origins, suggesting that recombination events had occurred. These results indicate that various PoKoV strains are prevalent and not restricted geographically on pig farms worldwide and the coexistence of multiple strains leads to recombination events of PoKoVs and contributes to the genetic diversity and evolution of PoKoVs.",article;controlled study;feces;gene deletion;gene sequence;genetic variability;genome analysis;Japan;Kobuvirus;metagenomics;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;phylogenetic tree;pig;porcine kobuvirus;priority journal;virus genome;virus recombination;virus strain,"Akagami, M.;Ito, M.;Niira, K.;Kuroda, M.;Masuda, T.;Haga, K.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Naoi, Y.;Kishimoto, M.;Sano, K.;Omatsu, T.;Aoki, H.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Oka, T.;Ichimaru, T.;Yamasato, H.;Ouchi, Y.;Shirai, J.;Katayama, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2017.0,,10.1007/s11262-017-1464-9,1
30,Two new 'legumoviruses' (genus Begomovirus) naturally infecting soybean in Nigeria,"Two new 'legumoviruses' (genus Begomovirus; family Geminiviridae) naturally infecting soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) in Nigeria were molecularly characterized. Based on characteristic symptoms in soybean, the two viruses are provisionally designated as Soybean mild mottle virus (SbMMV) and Soybean chlorotic blotch virus (SbCBV). SbCBV has a bipartite genome, whereas SbMMV has only a DNA A component. The DNA A component of SbMMV is 2,768 nucleotides (nt) long and the DNA A and DNA B components of SbCBV are 2,708 and 2,647 nt long, respectively. In pairwise comparisons, the DNA A component of SbMMV and SbCBV showed 62% nt sequence identity, indicating that these two viruses are distinct. Whereas the DNA A of SbMMV contains two virion- and four complementary-sense open reading frames, that of SbCBV lacks the virus-sense AV2, a signature gene present in 'Old World' begomoviruses. A pairwise comparison with the corresponding nucleotide sequence of other begomoviruses in the databases indicated that SbCBV had a maximum of 74% identity with cowpea golden mosaic virus and SbMMV had a maximum of 65% identity with mungbean yellow mosaic India virus and kudzu mosaic virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA A component of SbCBV and SbMMV together with those of other begomoviruses available in the databases showed clustering of the two viruses within the 'legumovirus' clade of the begomovirus phylogenetic tree. In addition, the DNA A and B components of SbCBV from Centrosema pubescens Benth were found to be identical to those from soybean, indicating that leguminous wild species are a potential alternative host for the virus. Since soybean is an introduced crop, the identification of two distinct begomoviruses naturally infecting soybean in Nigeria suggests the occurrence of 'legumoviruses' in plant species indigenous to Africa and underscores their potential threat to sustainable cultivation of soybean on the African continent. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",virus DNA;amino acid sequence;article;Begomovirus;classification;genetic recombination;genetics;isolation and purification;molecular genetics;Nigeria;nomenclature;phylogeny;soybean;virology,"Alabi, O.

31,Serologic and Antigenic Properties of Malaysian Orf Virus Isolates - an in-Vitro Comparative-Study,"Three Malaysian orf virus isolates from goats (GV1, GV2 and GV3) were compared to three orf viruses from sheep (LBV Malaysian isolate, ORFII and NZ2 reference strains) in their serologic properties and protein profiles. Serologic tests such as cross agar gel precipitation test (AGPT), serum neutralization test (SNT), ELISA, indirect immunofluorescent test (IIF) and indirect immunoperoxidase test (IIP) revealed that the viruses were greatly related to each other. However,serotyping of these isolates by the use of homologous and heterologous titration of their hyperimmune sera (HIS) in SNT and ELISA showed opposite results and did not allow for the classification of these viruses as the goat and sheep origin. Protein analysis of these isolates was carried out by the use of SDS-Poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blotting and physical staining and immunodetection of blotted protein profiles. The results revealed that these isolates were different mainly in the polypeptides bands of 41.5, 39.5 and 37.5 kD.

32,Insights into Reston virus spillovers and adaption from virus whole genome sequences,"Reston virus (family Filoviridae) is unique among the viruses of the Ebolavirus genus in that it is considered non-pathogenic in humans, in contrast to the other members which are highly virulent. The virus has however, been associated with several outbreaks of highly lethal hemorrhagic fever in non-human primates (NHPs), specifically cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) originating in the Philippines. In addition, Reston virus has been isolated from domestic pigs in the Philippines. To better understand virus spillover events and potential adaption to new hosts, the whole genome sequences of representative Reston virus isolates were obtained using a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach and comparative genomic analysis and virus fitness analyses were performed. Nine virus genome sequences were completed for novel and previously described isolates obtained from a variety of hosts including a human case, non-human primates and pigs.","Animals;Disease Outbreaks/ve [Veterinary];Ebolavirus/ge [Genetics];Ebolavirus/py [Pathogenicity];*Filoviridae/ge [Genetics];Filoviridae/py [Pathogenicity];Filoviridae Infections/ve [Veterinary];Filoviridae Infections/vi [Virology];Genetic Markers/ge [Genetics];*Genome, Viral/ge [Genetics];Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola/ve [Veterinary];Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola/vi [Virology];High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Humans;Macaca fascicularis/vi [Virology];Swine/vi [Virology];0 (Genetic Markers)","Albarino, C.

33,A molecular epidemiological study of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (Newcastle disease virus) isolates by phylogenetic analysis of a partial nucleotide sequence of the fusion protein gene,"A sequence 375 nucleotides in length, which included the region encoding the cleavage activation site and signal peptide of the fusion protein gene, was determined for 174 isolates of Newcastle disease virus (avian paramyxovirus type 1). These were compared with the sequences of 164 isolates published on GenBank, and the resulting alignment was analysed phylogenetically using maximum likelihood. The results are presented as unrooted phylogenetic trees. Briefly, the isolates divided into six broadly distinct groups (lineages 1 to 6). Lineages 3 and 4 were further subdivided into four sublineages (a to d) and lineage 5 into five lineages (a to e). Considerable genetic heterogeneity was detected within avian paramyxoviruses type 1, which appears to be influenced by host, time and geographical origin. It is concluded that by using this dataset it will be possible to type future virus isolates rapidly on the basis of their nucleotide sequence and make inferences about their origins.","Animals;Evolution, Molecular;Geography;*Newcastle Disease/ep [Epidemiology];Newcastle Disease/vi [Virology];Newcastle disease virus/cl [Classification];*Newcastle disease virus/ge [Genetics];*Phylogeny;Poultry/vi [Virology];*Viral Fusion Proteins/ge [Genetics];0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)","Aldous, E.

Metagenomic sequencing revealed the presence of rotavirus B in feces from diseased piglets while no other pathogens were identified.

35,The long view: a selective review of 40 years of Newcastle disease research,"This review is written for the series celebrating the 40th year since the first issue of Avian Pathology. The aim of the authors was to cover the developments in Newcastle disease (ND) research over the last 40 years that they considered significant. During those 40 years there have been several panzootics of this serious disease in poultry and for the last 30 years there has been a continuing panzootic in domestic pigeons, which has spread to wild birds and poultry. The 40-year period began with worldwide outbreaks of severe ND, which served as an important impetus for ND research work. Although early work was concerned with controlling the disease, specifically by improving and developing new vaccines and vaccine regimens, even prior to the 1970s ND virus was seen as a useful laboratory virus for replication and virulence studies. This review covers the historical developments in the following areas: understanding the molecular basis of virulence; epidemiology and relatedness of different ND strains, both antigenically and genetically; the emergence of virulent strains and their relationship with viruses of low virulence; sequencing and understanding the viral genome and genes; the development of rapid molecular-based diagnostic tests; and the phylogeny and molecular taxonomy of ND virus. The authors suggest areas in which future research could or should be undertaken. © 2012 Copyright Crown Copyright.",animal;animal disease;bird;bird disease;classification;genetics;human;Newcastle disease;Newcastle disease virus;pandemic;pathogenicity;phylogeny;poultry;review;virology;virulence;virus genome,"Alexander, D.

36,Development of methodology based on commercialized SERS-active substrates for rapid discrimination of Poxviridae virions,"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) can be made an attractive approach for identification of Raman-active compounds and biological materials (i.e., toxins, viruses, or intact bacterial cells/spores) through development of reproducible, spatially uniform SERS-active substrates. Recently, reproducible (from substrate-to-substrate), spatially homogeneous (over large areas) SERS-active substrates have been commercialized and are now available in the marketplace. We have utilized these patterned surfaces to acquire SERS spectral signatures of intact bovine papular stomatitis, pseudocowpox, and Yaba monkey tumor viruses. Salient spectral signature features make it possible to discriminate among these genetically distinct Poxviridae-Chordopoxvirinae virions. In addition, partial least-squares, a multivariate calibration method, has been used to develop personal computer-borne algorimms useful for classification of unknown Parapoxvirus (e.g., bovine papular stomatitis virus and pseudocowpox virus) samples based solely on SERS spectral signatures. To our knowledge, this is the first report detailing application of these commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) SERS-active substrates to identification of intact poxviruses.",article;Chordopoxvirinae;controlled study;microcomputer;nonhuman;Poxviridae;Raman spectrometry;sensitivity analysis;validation study;virion;virus classification,"Alexander, T.

37,Etiology and pathology of epidemic outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 infection in Egyptian chicken farms,"Epidemic outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) virus H5N1 have been frequently reported in Egypt during the last nine years. Here we investigate the involvement of AI H5N1 in outbreaks of acute respiratory disease that occurred in several commercial chicken farms in Egypt in 2011, and we describe to the pathology caused by the virus in the course of the outbreak. Twenty-one chicken farms with history of acute respiratory symptoms and high mortalities were screened for AI H5N1. Virus identification was based on hemagglutination inhibition test, and PCR detection and sequencing of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. Virus distribution was determined by immunohistochemical staining of AI antigens in organs of infected birds. Standard H&E staining was performed for histological examination of affected organs. Eighty-one % of the examined birds, representing 100% of the screened farms, were positive for AI H5N1 virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the isolated virus reveals its affiliation to clade 2.2.1. Viral antigens were localized in the endothelial cells of the heart, liver, lungs and skin, where pathological lesions including congestion, hemorrhages, multifocal inflammation and necrosis were concurrently observed. According to the pattern of the viral antigen and lesion distribution in the visceral organs, we suggest cardiovascular and circulatory failures as the probable cause of death during these outbreaks. In conclusion, the present study further confirms the epidemic status of AI H5N1 virus in Egypt and reveals the highly pathogenic nature of the local isolates.",animal;chicken;Egypt;epidemic;genetics;Influenza A virus (H5N1);avian influenza;isolation and purification;pathology;phylogeny;veterinary medicine;virology,"Ali, A.;Elmowalid, G.;Abdel-Glil, M.;Sharafeldin, T.;Abdallah, F.;Mansour, S.;Nagy, A.;Ahmed, B.;Abdelmoneim, M.",2015.0,,10.1515/pjvs-2015-0101,0
38,"Molecular characterization of the complete genomes of two new field isolates of Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, and their phylogenetic analysis","Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV, family Bromoviridae) is found worldwide and has been used as a model virus for a long time, but no data is available about the genetic diversity of field isolates. Recently, two new field isolates (Car1 and Car2) of CCMV obtained from cowpea showed distinct phenotypic symptoms when inoculated to cowpea. CCMV-Car1 induced severe mosaic and interveinal chlorosis, while CCMV-Car2 produced mild mottling and leaf rolling. Both isolates produced asymptomatic infection in Nicotiana benthamiana. The complete genome of both isolates was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using specific primers against the CCMV sequences available in the GenBank database, cloned and sequenced. Both nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared between the newly sequenced CCMV isolates and the three previously characterized CCMV strains (T, M1, and R). Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA 1 sequence showed that CCMV-Car1 was in a separate branch from the rest of the CCMV isolates while CCMV-Car2 grouped together with CCMV-R. On the basis of RNA 2 and RNA 3 sequences, two major groupings were obtained. One group included CCMV-Car1 and CCMV-Car2 isolates while the other contained CCMV-T, CCMV-M1, and CCMV-R strains. Recombination programs detected a potential recombination event in the RNA 1 sequence of CCMV-Car2 isolate but not in RNA 2 and RNA 3 sequences. The results showed that both mutations and recombination have played an important role in the genetic diversity of these two new isolates of CCMV. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",virus RNA;5' untranslated region;article;Bromovirus;controlled study;cowpea chlorotic mottle virus;gene sequence;genetic database;genetic variability;molecular dynamics;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;open reading frame;phenotype;phylogeny;priority journal;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;RNA recombination;sequence alignment;stop codon;virus genome;virus isolation,"Ali, A.;Shafiekhani, M.;Olsen, J.",2011.0,,10.1007/s11262-011-0613-9,0
39,Hendra and Nipah infection: Emerging paramyxoviruses,"Since their first emergence in mid 1990s henipaviruses continued to re emerge in Australia and South East Asia almost every year. In total there has been more than 12 Nipah and 48 Hendra virus outbreaks reported in South East Asia and Australia, respectively. These outbreaks are associated with significant economic and health damages that most high risks countries (particularly in South East Asia) cannot bear the burden of such economical threats. Up until recently, there were no actual therapeutics available to treat or prevent these lethal infections. However, an international collaborative research has resulted in the identification of a potential equine Hendra vaccine capable of providing antibody protection against Hendra virus infections. Consequently, with the current findings and after nearly 2 decades since their first detection, are we there yet?

41,A virus discovery method incorporating DNase treatment and its application to the identification of two bovine parvovirus species,"Identification of previously unrecognized viral agents in serum or plasma samples is of great medical interest but remains a major challenge, primarily because of abundant host DNA. The current methods, library screening or representational difference analysis (RDA), are very laborious and require selected sample sets. We have developed a simple and reproducible method for discovering viruses in single serum samples that is based on DNase treatment of the serum followed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) of the fragments, and have evaluated its performance on known viruses. Both DNA viruses and RNA viruses at a concentration of ≈106 genome equivalents per mi were reproducibly identified in 50 μl of serum. While evaluating the method, two previously unknown parvoviruses were discovered in the bovine sera used as diluent. The near complete genome sequence of each virus was determined; their classification as two species (provisionally named bovine parvoviruses 2 and 3) was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Both viruses were found to be frequent contaminants of commercial bovine serum. DNase treatment of serum samples may prove to be a very useful tool for virus discovery. The DNase-SISPA method is suitable for screening of a large number of samples and also enables rapid sequence determination of high-titer viruses.",complementary DNA;DNA;nucleic acid;RNA;article;bovine;DNA virus;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;Parvoviridae;polymerase chain reaction;priority journal;RNA virus;virus genome,"Allander, T.;Emerson, S.

42,Cloning of a human parvovirus by molecular screening of respiratory tract samples,"The identification of new virus species is a key issue for the study of infectious disease but is technically very difficult. We developed a system for large-scale molecular virus screening of clinical samples based on host DNA depletion, random PCR amplification, large-scale sequencing, and bioinformatics. The technology was applied to pooled human respiratory tract samples. The first experiments detected seven human virus species without the use of any specific reagent. Among the detected viruses were one coronavirus and one parvovirus, both of which were at that time uncharacterized. The parvovirus, provisionally named human bocavirus, was in a retrospective clinical study detected in 17 additional patients and associated with lower respiratory tract infections in children. The molecular virus screening procedure provides a general culture-independent solution to the problem of detecting unknown virus species in single or pooled samples. We suggest that a systematic exploration of the viruses that infect humans, ""the human virome,"" can be initiated.",bioinformatics;nucleotide sequencing;respiratory tract infection;virus;MINUTE VIRUS;BOVINE PARVOVIRUS;SYNCYTIAL VIRUS;CANINES MVC;SEQUENCE;IDENTIFICATION;CHILDREN;CORONAVIRUS;HOSPITALIZATIONS;PATHOGENICITY,"Allander, T.;Tammi, M.

43,Estimation of viral richness from shotgun metagenomes using a frequency count approach,"BACKGROUND: Viruses are important drivers of ecosystem functions, yet little is known about the vast majority of viruses. Viral shotgun metagenomics enables the investigation of broad ecological questions in phage communities. One ecological characteristic is species richness, which is the number of different species in a community. Viruses do not have a phylogenetic marker analogous to the bacterial 16S rRNA gene with which to estimate richness, and so contig spectra are employed to measure the number of virus taxa in a given community. A contig spectrum is generated from a viral shotgun metagenome by assembling the random sequence reads into groups of sequences that overlap (contigs) and counting the number of sequences that group within each contig. Current tools available to analyze contig spectra to estimate phage richness are limited by relying on rank-abundance data. RESULTS: We present statistical estimates of virus richness from contig spectra. The program CatchAll (http://www.northeastern.edu/catchall/) was used to analyze contig spectra in terms of frequency count data rather than rank-abundance, thus enabling formal statistical analyses. Also, the influence of potentially spurious low-frequency counts on richness estimates was minimized by two methods, empirical and statistical. The results show greater estimates of viral richness than previous calculations in nearly all environments analyzed, including swine feces and reclaimed fresh water. CONCLUSIONS: CatchAll yielded consistent estimates of richness across viral metagenomes from the same or similar environments. Additionally, analysis of pooled viral metagenomes from different environments via mixed contig spectra resulted in greater richness estimates than those of the component metagenomes. Using CatchAll to analyze contig spectra will improve estimations of richness from viral shotgun metagenomes, particularly from large datasets, by providing statistical measures of richness.",,"Allen, H.

44,Antibiotics in feed induce prophages in swine fecal microbiomes,"Antibiotics are a cost-effective tool for improving feed efficiency and preventing disease in agricultural animals, but the full scope of their collateral effects is not understood. Antibiotics have been shown to mediate gene transfer by inducing prophages in certain bacterial strains; therefore, one collateral effect could be prophage induction in the gut microbiome at large. Here we used metagenomics to evaluate the effect of two antibiotics in feed (carbadox and ASP250 [chlortetracycline, sul-famethazine, and penicillin]) on swine intestinal phage metagenomes (viromes). We also monitored the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ASP250, but not carbadox, caused significant population shifts in both the phage and bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes, such as multidrug resistance efflux pumps, were identified in the viromes, but in-feed antibiotics caused no significant changes in their abundance. The abundance of phage integrase-encoding genes was significantly increased in the viromes of medicated swine over that in the viromes of nonmedicated swine, demonstrating the induction of prophages with antibiotic treatment. Phage-bacterium population dynamics were also examined. We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of Streptococcus bacteria (prey) when Streptococcus phages (predators) were abundant, supporting the ""kill-the-winner"" ecological model of population dynamics in the swine fecal microbiome. The data show that gut ecosystem dynamics are influenced by phages and that prophage induction is a collateral effect of in-feed antibiotics. © 2011 Allen et al.",antibiotic agent;carbadox;chlortetracycline;penicillin G;RNA 16S;sulfadimidine;animal experiment;antibiotic resistance gene;article;bacterial gene;controlled study;drug effect;feces microflora;female;gene sequence;gene transfer;integrase gene;intestine flora;metagenome;metagenomics;microbial diversity;microbial population dynamics;microbiome;multidrug resistance;nonhuman;population abundance;priority journal;prophage;Streptococcus;pig,"Allen, H.

47,Epidemiological study of air filtration systems for preventing PRRSV infection in large sow herds,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most economically significant pathogen in the US swine industry. Aerosol transmission among herds is a major concern in pig dense regions and filtration of incoming air, in combination with standard biosecurity procedures, has been demonstrated to prevent transmission of PRRSV into susceptible herds. To quantify the impact of air filtration on reducing risk of PRRSV outbreaks, we compared the incidence rate of new PRRSV introductions in 20 filtered and 17 non-filtered control sow herds in a swine dense region of North America during a 7. year study period. Events of novel virus introduction were ascertained by phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV ORF5 gene sequences. Putative new viruses were defined as exogenous (introduced) based on ORF5 nucleotide sequence differences compared to previous farm isolates. The influence of sequence difference cut-off values ranging from 2 to 10% on case definition and relative risk were evaluated. Non-filtered farms incurred about 0.5 outbreaks per year, with a seasonal increase in risk in cooler periods. Baseline risk, prior to filtration, in treatment farms was approximately 0.75 per year, approximately 50% higher than in control farms. Air filtration significantly reduced risk of PRRSV introduction events to 0.06-0.22 outbreaks per year, depending on the cut-off values used to classify a virus isolate as new to the herd. Overall, air filtration led to an approximately 80% reduction in risk of introduction of novel PRRSV, indicating that on large sow farms with good biosecurity in swine-dense regions, approximately four-fifths of PRRSV outbreaks may be attributable to aerosol transmission. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",virus RNA;aerosol;air;air filtration;animal;animal disease;animal husbandry;Arterivirus;article;biosecurity;epidemic;epidemiology;evaluation study;female;filtration;genetics;incidence;isolation and purification;methodology;phylogeny;polymerase chain reaction;porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome;prospective study;PRRS;retrospective study;season;sequence analysis;pig;United States;virology,"Alonso, C.;Murtaugh, M.

48,Characterization of H5N1 influenza a virus that caused the first highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in Saudi Arabia,"Introduction: Saudi Arabia (SA) experienced a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak in domesticated birds in 2007. Methodology: Forty-three hemagglutinin (HA) and 41 neuraminidase (NA) genes of HPAI H5N1 viruses were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses of completely sequenced genes were performed to compare with other viral HA and NA gene sequences available in the public databases. Results: Molecular characterization of the H5N1 viruses revealed two genetically distinct clades, 2.2.2 and 2.3.1, of H5N1 viruses circulating in the area. Amino acid sequence analysis of the HA gene indicated that the virus from 2.2.2 contained the sequence SPQGERRRK-R/G at the cleavage site, while the virus from 2.3.1 contained the sequence SPQRERRRK-R/G. Additionally, a few mutations with amino acid substitutions such as M226I at N-link glycosylation site were identified in two of these isolates. Amino acid sequence of the NA gene showed a 20-amino-acid deletion in the NA stalk region, required for enhanced virulence of influenza viruses and its adaptation from wild birds to domestic chickens. As close contact between humans and birds is unavoidable, there is a need for a thorough understanding of the virus epidemiology, factors affecting the spread of the virus, and molecular characterization such as phylogeny and substitution rates of H5N1 viruses circulating in the region. Conclusion: Two genetically distinct clades were found to be circulating in the country, which could likely result in recombination and emergence of more virulent viral strains. These findings could be helpful for the authorities devising control measures against these viruses.",complementary DNA;Influenza virus hemagglutinin;virus RNA;virus sialidase;amino acid sequence;article;avian influenza;cladistics;codon;DNA cleavage;DNA sequence;gene mutation;genetic similarity;genetic variability;glycosylation;human;Influenza A virus (H5N1);Influenza virus hemagglutinin gene;neighbor joining method;nonhuman;nucleic acid base substitution;phylogeny;polymerase chain reaction;Saudi Arabia;virus gene;virus sialidase gene;virus virulence,"Al-Qahtani, A.

50,Molecular characterization of the first bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) strains isolated from in vitro bovine embryos production in Argentina,"Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) is increasingly considered as responsible for various problems of the reproductive tract. The virus infects mainly blood mononuclear cells and displays specific tropism for vascular endothelia, reproductive and fetal tissues. Epidemiological studies suggest its impact on reproductive performance, and its presence in various sites in the reproductive tract highlights its potential transmission in transfer-stage embryos. This work describes the biological and genetic characterization of BoHV-4 strains isolated from an in vitro bovine embryo production system. BoHV-4 strains were isolated in 2011 and 2013 from granulosa cells and bovine oocytes from ovary batches collected at a local abattoir, used as ""starting material"" for in vitro production of bovine embryos. Compatible BoHV-4-CPE was observed in the co-culture of granulosa cells and oocytes with MDBK cells. The identity of the isolates was confirmed by PCR assays targeting three ORFs of the viral genome. The phylogenetic analyses of the strains suggest that they were evolutionary unlinked. Therefore it is possible that BoHV-4 ovary infections occurred regularly along the evolution of the virus, at least in Argentina, which can have implications in the systems of in vitro embryo production. Thus, although BoHV-4 does not appear to be a frequent risk factor for in vitro embryo production data are still limited. This study reveals the potential of BoHV-4 transmission via embryo transfer. Moreover, the high variability among the BoHV-4 strains isolated from aborted cows in Argentina highlights the importance of further research on the role of this virus as an agent with the potential to cause reproductive disease in cattle. The genetic characterization of the isolated strains provides data to better understand the pathogenesis of BoHV-4 infections. Furthermore, it will lead to fundamental insights into the molecular aspects of the virus and the means by which these strains circulate in the herds.",animal cell;animal tissue;Argentina;article;bovine;Bovine herpesvirus 4;embryo;embryo transfer;gene sequence;genetic analysis;granulosa cell;in vitro study;molecular evolution;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;oocyte;open reading frame;phylogeny;polymerase chain reaction;viral genetics;virus detection;virus isolation;virus strain;virus transmission,"Altamiranda, E.

54,"A broad spectrum, one-step reverse-transcription PCR amplification of the neuraminidase gene from multiple subtypes of influenza A virus","BACKGROUND: The emergence of high pathogenicity strains of Influenza A virus in a variety of human and animal hosts, with wide geographic distribution, has highlighted the importance of rapid identification and subtyping of the virus for outbreak management and treatment. Type A virus can be classified into subtypes according to the viral envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Here we review the existing specificity and amplification of published primers to subtype neuraminidase genes and describe a new broad spectrum primer pair that can detect all 9 neuraminidase subtypes. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of 3,337 full-length influenza A neuraminidase segments in the NCBI database revealed semi-conserved regions not previously targeted by primers. Two degenerate primers with M13 tags, NA8F-M13 and NA10R-M13 were designed from these regions and used to generate a 253 bp cDNA product. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful in 31/32 (97%) cases using a touchdown protocol with RNA from over 32 different cultured influenza A virus strains representing the 9 neuraminidase subtypes. Frozen blinded clinical nasopharyngeal aspirates were also assayed and were mostly of subtype N2. The region amplified was direct sequenced and then used in database searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA. The RT-PCR fragment generated includes one of the mutation sites related to oseltamivir resistance, H274Y. CONCLUSION: Our one-step RT-PCR assay followed by sequencing is a rapid, accurate, and specific method for detection and subtyping of different neuraminidase subtypes from a range of host species and from different geographical locations.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Animals;Charadriiformes/vi [Virology];Chickens/vi [Virology];Child;Child, Preschool;DNA Primers;Ducks/vi [Virology];Female;Horses/vi [Virology];Humans;Infant;Influenza A Virus, H9N2 Subtype;*Influenza A virus/cl [Classification];*Influenza A virus/ge [Genetics];Influenza A virus/ip [Isolation & Purification];Influenza in Birds/vi [Virology];Influenza, Human/vi [Virology];Male;Middle Aged;Nasopharynx/vi [Virology];*Neuraminidase/ge [Genetics];Orthomyxoviridae Infections/ve [Veterinary];Orthomyxoviridae Infections/vi [Virology];RNA, Viral/an [Analysis];RNA, Viral/ge [Genetics];*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/mt [Methods];Sensitivity and Specificity;Sequence Analysis, DNA;0 (DNA Primers);0 (RNA, Viral)","Alvarez, A.

55,Double-stranded RNA high-throughput sequencing reveals a new cytorhabdovirus in a bean golden mosaic virus-resistant common bean transgenic line,"Using double-strand RNA (dsRNA) high-throughput sequencing, we identified five RNA viruses in a bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV)-resistant common bean transgenic line with symptoms of viral infection. Four of the identified viruses had already been described as infecting common bean (cowpea mild mottle virus, bean rugose mosaic virus, Phaseolus vulgaris alphaendornavirus 1, and Phaseolus vulgaris alphaendornavirus 2) and one is a putative new plant rhabdovirus (genus Cytorhabdovirus), tentatively named bean-associated cytorhabdovirus (BaCV). The BaCV genome presented all five open reading frames (ORFs) found in most rhabdoviruses: nucleoprotein (N) (ORF1) (451 amino acids, aa), phosphoprotein (P) (ORF2) (445 aa), matrix (M) (ORF4) (287 aa), glycoprotein (G) (ORF5) (520 aa), and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) (ORF6) (114 aa), as well as a putative movement protein (P3) (ORF3) (189 aa) and the hypothetical small protein P4. The predicted BaCV proteins were compared to homologous proteins from the closest cytorhabdoviruses, and a low level of sequence identity (15–39%) was observed. The phylogenetic analysis shows that BaCV clustered with yerba mate chlorosis-associated virus (YmCaV) and rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV). Overall, our results provide strong evidence that BaCV is indeed a new virus species in the genus Cytorhabdovirus (family Rhabdoviridae), the first rhabdovirus to be identified infecting common bean.",Nextera;pCR 2 TOPO vector;PCR assay kit;SuperScript;double stranded RNA;matrix protein;plant virus movement protein;RNA directed RNA polymerase;viral protein;virus glycoprotein;virus nucleoprotein;Alphaendornavirus;article;bean;Carlavirus;Comovirus;Cytorhabdovirus;high throughput sequencing;metagenomics;molecular diagnosis;open reading frame;phylogenetic tree;phylogeny;plant virus;real time polymerase chain reaction;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;Rhabdoviridae;RNA extraction;Sanger sequencing;sequence analysis;transgenic plant;viral plant disease;virus genome;virus infection;virus isolation,"Alves-Freitas, D.

57,Bovine-like coronaviruses in domestic and wild ruminants,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) produce a wide spectrum of disease syndromes in different mammalian and avian host species. These viruses are well-recognized for their ability to change tissue tropism, to hurdle the interspecies barriers and to adapt ecological variations. It is predicted that the inherent genetic diversity of CoVs caused by accumulation of point mutations and high frequency of homologous recombination is the principal determinant of these competences. Several CoVs (e.g. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) have been recorded to cross the interspecies barrier, inducing different disease conditions in variable animal hosts. Bovine CoV (BCoV) is a primary cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease in cattle calves, winter dysentery in lactating cows and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle. Although it has long been known as a restrictive cattle pathogen, CoVs that are closely related to BCoV have been recognized in dogs, humans and in other ruminant species. Biologic, antigenic and genetic analyses of the so-called 'bovine-like CoVs' proposed classification of these viruses as host-range variants rather than distinct virus species. In this review, the different bovine-like CoVs that have been identified in domesticated ruminants (water buffalo, sheep, goat, dromedary camel, llama and alpaca) and wild ruminants (deer, wild cattle, antelopes, giraffes and wild goats) are discussed in terms of epidemiology, transmission and virus characteristics. The presented data denote the importance of these viruses in the persistence of BCoV in nature, spread to new geographical zones, and continuous emergence of disease epidemics in cattle farms.",agricultural land;alpaca;animal experiment;animal model;antelope;article;bird;calf (mammal);cow;dog;dromedary;dysentery;epidemic;female;gastroenteritis;genetic analysis;genetic variability;giraffe;goat;homologous recombination;host range;llama;Middle East respiratory syndrome;nonhuman;pneumonic pasteurellosis;point mutation;severe acute respiratory syndrome;sheep;tropism;virus transmission;water buffalo;wildlife;winter;biological product,"Amer, H.

58,Metagenomic analysis demonstrates the diversity of the fecal virome in asymptomatic pigs in East Africa,"Pigs harbor a variety of viruses that are closely related to human viruses and are suspected to have zoonotic potential. Little is known about the presence of viruses in smallholder farms where pigs are in close contact with humans and wildlife. This study provides insight into viral communities and the prevalence and characteristics of enteric viral co-infections in smallholder pigs in East Africa. Sequence-independent amplification and high-throughput sequencing were applied to the metagenomics analysis of viruses in feces collected from asymptomatic pigs. A total of 47,213 de novo-assembled contigs were constructed and compared with sequences from the GenBank database. Blastx search results revealed that 1039 contigs (>200 nt) were related to viral sequences in the GenBank database. Of the 1039 contigs, 612 were not assigned to any viral taxa because they had little similarity to known viral genomic or protein sequences, while 427 contigs had a high level of sequence similarity to known viruses and were assigned to viral taxa. The most frequent contigs related to mammalian viruses resembling members of the viral genera Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Bocavirus, Circovirus, and Kobuvirus. Other less abundant contigs were related to members of the genera Sapelovirus, Pasivirus, Posavirus, Teschovirus and Picobirnavirus. This is the first report on the diversity of the fecal virome of pig populations in East Africa. The findings of the present study help to elucidate the etiology of diarrheal diseases in pigs and identify potential zoonotic and emerging viruses in the region. Further investigations are required to compare the incidence of these viruses in healthy and diseased pigs in order to better elucidate their pathogenic role.",Africa;animal;classification;feces;genetics;isolation and purification;phylogeny;pig;swine disease;veterinary medicine;virology;virus;virus infection;zoonosis,"Amimo, J.

59,Association of increased rate of condemnation of broiler carcasses due to hepatic abnormalities with immunosuppressive diseases in the broiler chicken industry in Saskatchewan,"The objective of this study was to identify the causative agents of hepatitis observed in broiler chickens at processing. Livers of chickens from 16 broiler farms in Saskatchewan with gross lesions of hepatitis were collected at processing. In addition to routine bacterial isolation and histopathological examination, serologic studies for infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and Chicken anaemia virus (CAV), calculation of the ratio of the weight of the bursa of Fabricius (BF) to body weight (BBW), and histopathological examination of the BF were done. Of the 264 livers with gross lesions, 83% had multifocal to coalescing necrotizing hepatitis, 16% had perihepatitis, and 1% had hemorrhages. No definitive causative microorganisms were isolated from the hepatic lesions; however, no significant bacterial isolations were made. Bursal atrophy, low BBW ratio, and high titer of antibody against IBDV each correlated with the rate of total condemnations (P = 0.0188, P = 0.0001, and P = 0.0073, respectively). Nucleotide sequencing of IBDV isolated from the BF identified the variant strains Delaware-E and 586. Condemnation because of hepatic lesions was correlated with titer of antibody against IBDV and BBW (P = 0.016 and P = 0.027). The results of this study demonstrate that hepatic lesions in Saskatchewan chickens are not currently caused by a primary bacterial pathogen but are associated with indicators of immunosuppression that is likely due to variant IBDV.",animal experiment;animal model;animal tissue;article;biochemical analysis;body weight;broiler;Canada;controlled study;enzyme linked immunosorbent assay;high throughput sequencing;histopathology;immunosuppressive treatment;liver disease;liver injury;nonhuman;perihepatitis;polymerase chain reaction,"Amini, K.;Zachar, T.;Popowich, S.;Knezacek, T.;Goodhope, B.;Willson, P.;Gomis, S.",2015.0,,,0

All organs came from a donor who had been exposed to a hamster infected with LCMV. The hamster was traced back through a Rhode Island pet store to a distribution center in Ohio, and more LCMV-infected hamsters were discovered in both. Rodents from the Ohio facility and its parent facility in Arkansas were tested for the same LCMV strain as the 1 involved in the transplant-associated deaths. Phylogenetic analysis of virus sequences linked the rodents from the Ohio facility to the Rhode Island pet store, the index hamster, and the transplant recipients.

62,"Genetic characterization of 2008 reassortant influenza A virus (H5N1), Thailand","In January and November 2008, outbreaks of avian influenza have been reported in 4 provinces of Thailand. Eight Influenza A H5N1 viruses were recovered from these 2008 AI outbreaks and comprehensively characterized and analyzed for nucleotide identity, genetic relatedness, virulence determinants, and possible sites of reassortment. The results show that the 2008 H5N1 viruses displayed genetic drift characteristics (less than 3% genetic differences), as commonly found in influenza A viruses. Based on phylogenetic analysis, clade 1 viruses in Thailand were divided into 3 distinct branches (subclades 1, 1.1 and 1.2). Six out of 8 H5N1 isolates have been identified as reassorted H5N1 viruses, while other isolates belong to an original H5N1 clade. These viruses have undergone inter-lineage reassortment between subclades 1.1 and 1.2 and thus represent new reassorted 2008 H5N1 viruses. The reassorted viruses have acquired gene segments from H5N1, subclade 1.1 (PA, HA, NP and M) and subclade 1.2 (PB2, PB1, NA and NS) in Thailand. Bootscan analysis of concatenated whole genome sequences of the 2008 H5N1 viruses supported the reassortment sites between subclade 1.1 and 1.2 viruses. Based on estimating of the time of the most recent common ancestors of the 2008 H5N1 viruses, the potential point of genetic reassortment of the viruses could be traced back to 2006. Genetic analysis of the 2008 H5N1 viruses has shown that most virulence determinants in all 8 genes of the viruses have remained unchanged. In summary, two predominant H5N1 lineages were circulating in 2008. The original CUK2-like lineage mainly circulated in central Thailand and the reassorted lineage (subclades 1.1 and 1.2) predominantly circulated in lower-north Thailand. To prevent new reassortment, emphasis should be put on prevention of H5N1 viruses circulating in high risk areas. In addition, surveillance and whole genome sequencing of H5N1 viruses should be routinely performed for monitoring the genetic drift of the virus and new reassorted strains, especially in light of potential reassortment between avian and mammalian H5N1 viruses.","Animals;Birds;Cluster Analysis;*Disease Outbreaks;Genotype;*Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype/ge [Genetics];Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype/ip [Isolation & Purification];*Influenza in Birds/ep [Epidemiology];*Influenza in Birds/vi [Virology];Molecular Sequence Data;Phylogeny;Poultry;RNA, Viral/ge [Genetics];*Reassortant Viruses/ge [Genetics];Reassortant Viruses/ip [Isolation & Purification];Sequence Analysis, DNA;Sequence Homology;Thailand/ep [Epidemiology];0 (RNA, Viral)","Amonsin, A.;Lapkuntod, J.;Suwannakarn, K.;Kitikoon, P.;Suradhat, S.;Tantilertcharoen, R.;Boonyapisitsopa, S.;Bunpapong, N.;Wongphatcharachai, M.;Wisedchanwet, T.;Theamboonlers, A.;Poovorawan, Y.;Sasipreeyajan, J.;Thanawongnuwech, R.",2010.0,Sep 16,,0
63,"Multi-year evolutionary dynamics of West Nile virus in suburban Chicago, USA, 2005-2007","West Nile virus has evolved in concert with its expansion across North America, but little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of the virus on local scales. We analysed viral nucleotide sequences from mosquitoes collected in 2005, 2006, and 2007 from a known transmission 'hot spot' in suburban Chicago, USA. Within this approximately 11 × 14 km area, the viral envelope gene has increased approximately 0.1% yr-1 in nucleotide-level genetic diversity. In each year, viral diversity was higher in 'residential' sites characterized by dense housing than in more open 'urban green space' sites such as cemeteries and parks. Phylodynamic analyses showed an increase in incidence around 2005, consistent with a higher-than-average peak in mosquito and human infection rates that year. Analyses of times to most recent common ancestor suggest that WNV in 2005 and 2006 may have arisen predominantly from viruses present during 2004 and 2005, respectively, but that WNV in 2007 had an older common ancestor, perhaps indicating a predominantly mixed or exogenous origin. These results show that the population of WNV in suburban Chicago is an admixture of viruses that are both locally derived and introduced from elsewhere, containing evolutionary information aggregated across a breadth of spatial and temporal scales. © 2010 The Royal Society.",virus envelope protein;virus RNA;animal;article;chemistry;Culex;DNA sequence;genetic variability;genetics;human;molecular evolution;molecular genetics;nucleotide sequence;phylogeny;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;sequence alignment;United States;virology;West Nile fever;West Nile virus,"Amore, G.;Bertolotti, L.;Hamer, G.

64,Genetic analysis of Akabane virus isolates from cattle in Korea,"Bayesian Inference (BI) and Neighbor Joining (NJ) analyses of the phylogenetic relationships between the nucleotide sequences of the N gene of Akabane virus revealed an unclear topology among genogroups I-III, which was probably caused by genetic reassortment or recombination between these genogroups. In contrast, nucleotide and amino acid phylogenetic tree analyses of the M RNA segment agreed with the topologies obtained by using the BI and NJ methods. Therefore, distinct genogrouping of Akabane virus isolates should be performed using the M RNA segment. Four Korea isolates were classified into genogroup II together with Akabane virus strains isolated from all areas of Japan, including Okinawa Island. However, more nationwide isolates and more clinical data from Korean cattle farms will be required in the future to confirm the precise relationships between genotypes and pathogenicity. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

UL33, UL34, and UL35 genes were oriented from the left to the right of genome, while UL31 and UL32 had an opposite orientation. A comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of the DEV ORFs with their alphaherpesvirus homologs showed well-conserved regions except for the UL34 and UL35 genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that DEV was closer to the genus Mardivirus than to any other genus of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae.

66,Whole genome analysis of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus identified limited genome constellations and preferential reassortment,"Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is a Culicoides transmitted orbivirus that causes haemorrhagic disease in wild and domestic ruminants. A collection of 44 EHDV isolated from 2008 to 2012 was fully sequenced and analysed phylogenetically. Serotype 2 viruses were the dominant serotype all years except 2012 when serotype 6 viruses represented 63% of the isolates. High genetic similarity (>94% identity) between serotype 1 and 2 virus VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, NS1, NS2 and NS3 segments prevented identification of reassortment events for these segments. Additionally, there was little genetic diversity (>96% identity) within serotypes for VP2, VP5 and VP7. Preferential reassortment within the homologous serotype was observed for VP2, VP5 and VP7 segments for type 1 and type 2 viruses. In contrast, type 6 viruses were all reassortants containing VP2 and VP5 derived from an exotic type 6 with the remaining segments most similar to type 2 viruses. These results suggest that reassortment between type 1 and type 2 viruses requires conservation of the VP2, VP5 and VP7 segment constellation while type 6 viruses only require VP2 and VP5 and are restricted to type 2-lineage VP7. As type 6 VP2 and VP5 segments were exclusively identified in viruses with type 2-derived VP7, these results suggest functional complementation between type 2 and type 6 VP7 proteins. © 2014 SGM.",nonstructural protein 1;nonstructural protein 2;nonstructural protein 3;protein VP1;protein VP2;protein VP3;protein VP4;protein VP5;protein VP6;protein VP7;unclassified drug;viral protein;animal tissue;article;controlled study;epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus;gene sequence;genetic complementation;genetic reassortment;genetic similarity;genetic variability;microbial population dynamics;molecular phylogeny;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;Orbivirus;priority journal;serotype;virus genome;virus isolation;virus strain,"Anbalagan, S.;Cooper, E.;Klumper, P.;Simonson, R.

67,Dietary energy drives the dynamic response of bovine rumen viral communities,"BACKGROUND: Rumen microbes play a greater role in host energy acquisition than that of gut-associated microbes in monogastric animals. Although genome-enabled advancements are providing access to the vast diversity of uncultivated microbes, our understanding of variables shaping rumen microbial communities is in its infancy. Viruses have been shown to impact microbial populations through a myriad of processes, including cell lysis and reprogramming of host metabolism. However, little is known about the processes shaping the distribution of rumen viruses or how viruses may modulate microbial-driven processes in the rumen. To this end, we investigated how rumen bacterial and viral community structure and function responded in five steers fed four randomized dietary treatments in a crossover design. RESULTS: Total digestible nutrients (TDN), a measure of dietary energy, best explained the variation in bacterial and viral communities. Additional ecological drivers of viral communities included dietary zinc content and microbial functional diversity. Using partial least squares regression, we demonstrate significant associations between the abundances of 267 viral populations and variables driving the variation in rumen viral communities. While rumen viruses were dynamic, 14 near ubiquitous viral populations were identified, suggesting the presence of a core rumen virome largely comprised of novel viruses. Moreover, analysis of virally encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) indicates rumen viruses have glycosidic hydrolases to potentially augment the breakdown of complex carbohydrates to increase energy production. Other AMGs identified have a role in redirecting carbon to the pentose phosphate pathway and one carbon pools by folate to boost viral replication. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that rumen bacteria and viruses have differing responses and ecological drivers to dietary perturbation. Our results show that rumen viruses have implications for understanding the structuring of the previously identified core rumen microbiota and impacting microbial metabolism through a vast array of AMGs. AMGs in the rumen appear to have consequences for microbial metabolism that are largely in congruence with the current paradigm established in marine systems. This study provides a foundation for future hypotheses regarding the dynamics of viral-mediated processes in the rumen.",virus DNA;zinc;animal;bacteriophage;bovine;classification;crossover procedure;diet;DNA sequence;drug effect;food;genetics;isolation and purification;metagenome;metagenomics;microbiology;microflora;procedures;rumen;virology;virus,"Anderson, C.

68,Characterization of co-circulating swine influenza A viruses in North America and the identification of a novel H1 genetic clade with antigenic significance,"Multiple genetically and antigenically distinct hemagglutinin genes of the H1 and H3 influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes co-circulate in North American swine. This diversity has evolved by repeated transmission of IAVs from humans to swine and subsequent antigenic drift in swine. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of these diverse HA lineages in North American swine, we undertook a phylogenetic analysis of 1576 H1 and 607 H3 HA gene segments, as well as 834 N1 and 1293 N2 NA gene segments, and 2126 M gene segments. These data revealed yearly co-circulation of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses, with three HA clades representing the majority of the HA sequences: of the H1 viruses, 42% were classified as H1δ1 and 40.6% were classified as H1γ and of the H3 viruses 53% were classified as cluster IV-A H3N2. We detected a genetically distinct minor clade consisting of 37 H1 viruses isolated between 2003 and 2013, which we classified as H1γ-2. We estimated that this clade circulated in swine since approximately 1995, but it was not detected in swine until 2003. Though this clade only represents 1.07% of swine H1 sequences reported over the past 10 years, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays demonstrated that representatives of this clade of viruses are antigenically distinct, and, when measured using antigenic cartography, were as many as 7 antigenic units from other H1γ viruses. Therefore vaccines against the contemporary H1γ viruses are not likely to cross-protect against γ-2 viruses. The long-term circulation of these γ-2 viruses suggests that minor populations of viruses may be underreported in the national dataset given the long branch lengths and gaps in detections. The identification of these γ-2 viruses demonstrates the need for robust surveillance to capture the full diversity IAVs in swine in the USA and the importance of antigenic drift in the diversification and emergence of new antigenic variants in swine, which complicates vaccine design.",antigenicity;article;bacteriophage;cladistics;gene identification;gene sequence;hemagglutination inhibition;Influenza A virus (H1N1);Influenza A virus (H1N2);Influenza A virus (H3N2);nonhuman;North America;phylogeny;priority journal;swine influenza A virus;swine influenza virus;virus characterization;virus gene,"Anderson, T.

69,A Phylogeny-Based Global Nomenclature System and Automated Annotation Tool for H1 Hemagglutinin Genes from Swine Influenza A Viruses,"The H1 subtype of influenza A viruses (IAVs) has been circulating in swine since the 1918 human influenza pandemic. Over time, and aided by further introductions from nonswine hosts, swine H1 viruses have diversified into three genetic lineages. Due to limited global data, these H1 lineages were named based on colloquial context, leading to a proliferation of inconsistent regional naming conventions. In this study, we propose rigorous phylogenetic criteria to establish a globally consistent nomenclature of swine H1 virus hemagglutinin (HA) evolution. These criteria applied to a data set of 7,070 H1 HA sequences led to 28 distinct clades as the basis for the nomenclature. We developed and implemented a web-accessible annotation tool that can assign these biologically informative categories to new sequence data. The annotation tool assigned the combined data set of 7,070 H1 sequences to the correct clade more than 99% of the time. Our analyses indicated that 87% of the swine H1 viruses from 2010 to the present had HAs that belonged to 7 contemporary cocirculating clades. Our nomenclature and web-accessible classification tool provide an accurate method for researchers, diagnosticians, and health officials to assign clade designations to HA sequences. The tool can be updated readily to track evolving nomenclature as new clades emerge, ensuring continued relevance. A common global nomenclature facilitates comparisons of IAVs infecting humans and pigs, within and between regions, and can provide insight into the diversity of swine H1 influenza virus and its impact on vaccine strain selection, diagnostic reagents, and test performance, thereby simplifying communication of such data. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A fundamental goal in the biological sciences is the definition of groups of organisms based on evolutionary history and the naming of those groups. For influenza A viruses (IAVs) in swine, understanding the hemagglutinin (HA) genetic lineage of a circulating strain aids in vaccine antigen selection and allows for inferences about vaccine efficacy. Previous reporting of H1 virus HA in swine relied on colloquial names, frequently with incriminating and stigmatizing geographic toponyms, making comparisons between studies challenging. To overcome this, we developed an adaptable nomenclature using measurable criteria for historical and contemporary evolutionary patterns of H1 global swine IAVs. We also developed a web-accessible tool that classifies viruses according to this nomenclature. This classification system will aid agricultural production and pandemic preparedness through the identification of important changes in swine IAVs and provides terminology enabling discussion of swine IAVs in a common context among animal and human health initiatives.",,"Anderson, T.

Amino acid sequences from four regions of open-reading frame 2 (ORF2) were used to analyze 101 NLV strains, including 2 bovine strains. On the basis of this analysis, a genetic classification scheme is proposed that differentiates 99 human strains into 2 major genetic groups consisting of 5 and 10 genetic clusters, respectively. The 2 bovine strains constitute a newly defined third major genetic group composed of 2 putative clusters represented by each strain. This classification scheme is well supported by the analysis of the entire ORF2 sequences from 38 strains selected to represent the genetic diversity of the human strains used above. This scheme should provide a firm scientific basis for the unified classification of NLV strains detected around the world.",amino acid sequence;conference paper;nonhuman;Norwalk virus;nucleotide sequence;open reading frame;priority journal;sequence analysis;strain difference;viral genetics;virus classification,"Ando, T.;Noel, J.

Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) was detected in 514/2,230 (23%) of HFMD patients admitted to 3 major hospitals in southern Vietnam during 2011-2015. Of these patients, 93 (18%) had severe HFMD. Phylogenetic analysis of 98 genome sequences revealed they belonged to cluster A and had been circulating in Vietnam for 2 years before emergence. CV-A6 movement among localities within Vietnam occurred frequently, whereas viral movement across international borders appeared rare. Skyline plots identified fluctuations in the relative genetic diversity of CV-A6 corresponding to large CV-A6-associated HFMD outbreaks worldwide. These data show that CV-A6 is an emerging pathogen and emphasize the necessity of active surveillance and understanding the mechanisms that shape the pathogen evolution and emergence, which is essential for development and implementation of intervention strategies.","Adolescent;Adult;Child;*Communicable Diseases, Emerging/ep [Epidemiology];*Communicable Diseases, Emerging/vi [Virology];*Coxsackievirus Infections/ep [Epidemiology];*Coxsackievirus Infections/vi [Virology];Enterovirus A, Human/cl [Classification];Enterovirus A, Human/ge [Genetics];Enterovirus A, Human/ip [Isolation & Purification];*Enterovirus A, Human;Female;Genome, Viral;Genomics/mt [Methods];*Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease/ep [Epidemiology];*Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease/vi [Virology];Humans;Male;Phylogeny;Phylogeography;Vietnam/ep [Epidemiology];Whole Genome Sequencing;Young Adult","Anh, N.

74,Origin of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus as studied by codon usage patterns and phylogenetic analysis,"The pandemic of 1918 was caused by an H1N1 influenza A virus, which is a negative strand RNA virus; however, little is known about the nature of its direct ancestral strains. Here we applied a broad genetic and phylogenetic analysis of a wide range of influenza virus genes, in particular the PB1 gene, to gain information about the phylogenetic relatedness of the 1918 H1N1 virus. We compared the RNA genome of the 1918 strain to many other influenza strains of different origin by several means, including relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), effective number of codons (ENC), and phylogenetic relationship. We found that the PB1 gene of the 1918 pandemic virus had ENC values similar to the H1N1 classical swine and human viruses, but different ENC values from avian as well as H2N2 and H3N2 human viruses. Also, according to the RSCU of the PB1 gene, the 1918 virus grouped with all human isolates and ""classical'' swine H1N1 viruses. The phylogenetic studies of all eight RNA gene segments of influenza A viruses may indicate that the 1918 pandemic strain originated from a H1N1 swine virus, which itself might be derived from a H1N1 avian precursor, which was separated from the bulk of other avian viruses in toto a long time ago. The high stability of the RSCU pattern of the PB1 gene indicated that the integrity of RNA structure is more important for influenza virus evolution than previously thought.

75,Characterization of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 virus from Egyptian domestic waterfowl in 2017,"In 2016, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus was detected in wild birds for the first time in Egypt. In the present study, we identified the HPAI virus H5N8 of clade 2.3.4.4 from domestic waterfowl in Egypt, suggesting its transmission to the domestic poultry from the migratory birds. Based on partial haemagglutinin gene sequence, this virus has a close genetic relationship with subtype H5N8 viruses circulating in Asia and Europe. Pathologically, H5N8 virus in hybrid duck induced nervous signs accompanied by encephalomalacia, haemorrhages, nonsuppurative encephalitis and nonsuppurative vasculitis. The granular layer of cerebellum showed multifocal areas of hydropic degeneration and the Purkinje cell neurons were necrotized or lost. Additionally, the lung, kidney and spleen were congested, and necrotizing pancreatitis was also observed. The co-circulation of both HPAI H5N1 and H5N8 subtypes with the low pathogenic avian influenza H9N2 subtype complicate the control of avian influenza in Egypt with the possibility of emergence of new reassortant viruses. Therefore, continuous monitoring with implementation of strict control measures is required. Research highlights: HPAI H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 was detected in domestic ducks and geese in Egypt in 2017. Phylogenetically, the virus was closely related to HPAI H5N8 viruses identified in Asia and Europe Nonsuppurative encephalitis was widely observed in HPAI H5N8 virus-infected ducks.

76,Two novel bocaparvovirus species identified in wild Himalayan marmots,"Bocaparvovirus (BOV) is a genetically diverse group of DNA viruses and a possible cause of respiratory, enteric, and neurological diseases in humans and animals. Here, two highly divergent BOVs (tentatively named as Himalayan marmot BOV, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2) were identified in the livers and feces of wild Himalayan marmots in China, by viral metagenomic analysis. Five of 300 liver samples from Himalayan marmots were positive for HMBOV1 and five of 99 fecal samples from these animals for HMBOV2. Their nearly complete genome sequences are 4,672 and 4,887 nucleotides long, respectively, with a standard genomic organization and containing protein-coding motifs typical for BOVs. Based on their NS1, NP1, and VP1, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are most closely related to porcine BOV SX/1-2 (approximately 77.0%/50.0%, 50.0%/53.0%, and 79.0%/54.0% amino acid identity, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis of these three proteins showed that HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 formed two distinctly independent branches in BOVs. According to these results, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are two different novel species in the Bocaparvovirus genus. Their identification expands our knowledge of the genetic diversity and evolution of BOVs. Further studies are needed to investigate their potential pathogenicity and their impact on Himalayan marmots and humans.",animal;Bocaparvovirus;China;classification;DNA sequence;feces;genetics;geography;liver;Marmota;metagenomics;nucleotide sequence;open reading frame;parvovirus infection;phylogeny;physiology;rodent disease;sequence homology;virology;virus genome,"Ao, Y.;Li, X.;Li, L.;Xie, X.;Jin, D.;Yu, J.;Lu, S.;Duan, Z.",2017.0,,10.1007/s11427-017-9231-4,0
77,Diverse novel astroviruses identified in wild Himalayan marmots,"With advances in viral surveillance and next-generation sequencing, highly diverse novel astroviruses (AstVs) and different animal hosts had been discovered in recent years. However, the existence of AstVs in marmots had yet to be shown. Here, we identified two highly divergent strains of AstVs (tentatively named Qinghai Himalayanmarmot AstVs, HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2), by viral metagenomic analysis in liver tissues isolated from wild Marmota himalayana in China. Overall, 12 of 99 (12.1 %) M. himalayana faecal samples were positive for the presence of genetically diverse AstVs, while only HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 were identified in 300 liver samples. The complete genomic sequences of HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 were 6681 and 6610 nt in length, respectively, with the typical genomic organization of AstVs. Analysis of the complete ORF 2 sequence showed that these novel AstVs are most closely related to the rabbit AstV, mamastrovirus 23 (with 31.0 and 48.0% shared amino acid identity, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 indicated that HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 form two distinct clusters among the mamastroviruses, and may share a common ancestor with the rabbit-specific mamastrovirus 23. These results suggest that HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 are two novel species of the genus Mamastrovirus in the Astroviridae. The remarkable diversity of these novel AstVs will contribute to a greater understanding of the evolution and ecology of AstVs, although additional studies will be needed to understand the clinical significance of these novel AstVs in marmots, as well as in humans.",novel astroviruses;species;Himalayan marmots;complete genome;phylogenetic analysis;COMPLETE GENOME SEQUENCE;MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION;RESPIRATORY;SYNDROME;MIDDLE-EAST;ENCEPHALITIS;VIRUS;CORONAVIRUS;HEPATITIS;CATTLE;WOODCHUCK,"Ao, Y.

80,Phylodynamics of avian influenza clade 2.2.1 H5N1 viruses in Egypt,"Background: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype are widely distributed within poultry populations in Egypt and have caused multiple human infections. Linking the epidemiological and sequence data is important to understand the transmission, persistence and evolution of the virus. This work describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H5N1 based on molecular characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of isolates collected from February 2006 to May 2014. Methods: Full-length HA sequences of 368 H5N1 viruses were generated and were genetically analysed to study their genetic evolution. They were collected from different poultry species, production sectors, and geographic locations in Egypt. The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) method was applied to estimate the evolutionary rates among different virus clusters; additionally, an analysis of selection pressures in the HA gene was performed using the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) method. Results: The phylogenetic analysis of the H5 gene from 2006-14 indicated the presence of one virus introduction of the classic clade (2.2.1) from which two main subgroups were originated, the variant subgroup which was further subdivided into 2 sub-divisions (2.2.1.1 and 2.2.1.1a) and the endemic subgroup (2.2.1.2). The clade 2.2.1.2 showed a high evolution rate over a period of 6 years (6.9 × 10-3 sub/site/year) in comparison to the 2.2.1.1a variant cluster (7.2 × 10-3 over a period of 4 years). Those two clusters are under positive selection as they possess 5 distinct positively selected sites in the HA gene. The mutations at 120, 154, and 162 HA antigenic sites and the other two mutations (129Δ, I151T) that occurred from 2009-14 were found to be stable in the 2.2.1.2 clade. Additionally, 13 groups of H5N1 HPAI viruses were identified based on their amino acid sequences at the cleavage site and ""EKRRKKR"" became the dominant pattern beginning in 2013. Conclusions: Continuous evolution of H5N1 HPAI viruses in Egypt has been observed in all poultry farming and production systems in almost all regions of the country. The wide circulation of the 2.2.1.2 clade carrying triple mutations (120, 129Δ, I151T) associated with increased binding affinity to human receptors is an alarming finding of public health importance.",avian influenza vaccine;virus antigen;amino acid sequence;article;avian influenza (H5N1);cladistics;controlled study;Egypt;endemic disease;gene cluster;gene isolation;gene mutation;gene sequence;geography;hemagglutinin gene;Influenza A virus (H5N1);molecular dynamics;molecular evolution;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;phylogeny;poultry;protein cleavage;virus gene;virus identification,"Arafa, A.;El-Masry, I.;Kholosy, S.;Hassan, M.

81,Complete genome characterization of avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 from a commercial quail flock in Egypt,"The suspected presence of avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 in poultry in Egypt is a major concern since this subtype is widely distributed in different countries in the Middle East, here we describe the full genetic characterization of an avian influenza A virus (Qa/Egypt/11; H9N2) of subtype H9N2 that was previously isolated from a clinically normal quail flock in Giza, Egypt in May 2011. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of the isolated Egyptian virus showed the highest similarity with one group of recent Israeli strains (97 %) circulating from 2006-2010. Sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Qa/Egypt/11 isolate belonged to the A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997-like lineage with new mutations identified in all viral proteins. The phylogenetic analysis for the eight genes indicated placement of the Egyptian virus within the same lineage of H9N2 viruses that circulated in the region from 2006, especially with one group of recent Israeli strains. However, phylogenetic analysis of the internal genes like PB2, NP, and PA genes identified possible reassortment events for these genes with singular Israeli strains. This study indicates progressive evolution of this subtype in the Middle East region and possible mechanism of virus adaptation in land-based poultry like in quails. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",hemagglutinin;viral protein;adaptation;animal cell;article;avian influenza virus;avian influenza virus H9N2;controlled study;Egypt;gene mutation;genetic reassortment;molecular evolution;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;phylogeny;poultry;priority journal;quail;sequence analysis;sequence homology;virus genome;virus isolation;virus strain,"Arafa, A.

82,Characterization of Sri Lanka rabies virus isolates using nucleotide sequence analysis of nucleoprotein gene,"Thirty-four suspected rabid brain samples from 2 humans, 24 dogs, 4 cats, 2 mongooses, 1 jackal and 1 water buffalo were collected in 1995-1996 in Sri Lanka. Total RNA was extracted directly from brain suspensions and examined using a one-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the rabies virus nucleoprotein (N) gene. Twenty-eight samples were found positive for the virus N gene by RT-PCR and also for the virus antigens by fluorescent antibody (FA) test. Rabies virus isolates obtained from different animal species in different regions of Sri Lanka were genetically homogenous. Sequences of 203 nucleotides (nt)-long RT-PCR products obtained from 16 of 27 samples were found identical. Sequences of 1350 nt of N genes of 14 RT-PCR products were determined. The Sri Lanka isolates under study formed a specific cluster that included also an earlier isolate from India but did not include the known isolates from China, Thailand, Malaysia, Israel, Iran, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Nepal, Philippines, Japan and from several other countries. These results suggest that one type of rabies virus is circulating among human, dog, cat, mongoose, jackal and water buffalo living near Colombo City and in other five remote regions in Sri Lanka.",virus antigen;virus nucleoprotein;virus RNA;agar gel electrophoresis;amino acid sequence;animal tissue;article;brain;buffalo;Carnivora;cat;controlled study;dog;fluorescent antibody technique;human;human tissue;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;phylogeny;Rabies virus;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;Sri Lanka;virus characterization;virus isolation,"Arai, Y.

83,Phylogenetic analysis of classical swine fever virus isolates from Peru,"Classical swine fever (CSF) is considered to be endemic in Peru with outbreaks reported to the World Organization for Animal Health as recently as 2008 and 2009. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the genetic subgroup(s) of CSF virus that are circulating in Peru or their relationship to recent CSF viruses that have been isolated from neighbouring South American countries or other parts of the world. In this study, we molecularly characterize CSF viruses that were isolated from domestic pigs from different regions of Peru from the middle of 2007 to early 2008. All virus isolates were found to belong to genetic subgroup 1.1, consistent with the subgroup of viruses that have been identified from other South American countries. Although the Peruvian isolates are most closely related to viruses from Colombia and Brazil, they form a monophyletic clade, which suggests they have a distinct evolutionary history. ©2010 Canadian Food Inspection Agency.",animal;article;classical swine fever;classification;genetics;Peru;Pestivirus;phylogeny;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;pig;virology,"Araínga, M.;Hisanaga, T.;Hills, K.;Handel, K.;Rivera, H.;Pasick, J.",2010.0,,10.1111/j.1865-1682.2010.01144.x,0
84,Migratory birds in southern Brazil are a source of multiple avian influenza virus subtypes,"BACKGROUND: There is insufficient knowledge about the relation of avian influenza virus (AIV) to migratory birds in South America. Accordingly, we studied samples obtained over a 4-year period (2009-2012) from wild birds at a major wintering site in southern Brazil. METHODS: We obtained 1212 oropharyngeal/cloacal samples from wild birds at Lagoa do Peixe National Park and screened them for influenza A virus by RT-PCR amplification of the matrix gene. Virus isolates were subjected to genomic sequencing and antigenic characterization. RESULTS: Forty-eight samples of 1212 (3.96%) contained detectable influenza virus RNA. Partial viral sequences were obtained from 12 of these samples, showing the presence of H2N2 (1), H6Nx (1), H6N1 (8), H9N2 (1), and H12N5 (1) viruses. As H6 viruses predominated, we generated complete genomes from all 9 H6 viruses. Phylogenetic analyses showed that they were most similar to viruses of South American lineage. The H6N1 viruses caused no disease signs in infected ferrets and, despite genetic differences, were antigenically similar to North American isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Lagoa do Peixe National Park is a source of multiple AIV subtypes, with the levels of influenza virus in birds being highest at the end of their wintering period in this region. H6N1 viruses were the predominant subtype identified. These viruses were more similar to viruses of South American lineage than to those of North American lineage.","Animals;Antigens, Viral/an [Analysis];*Birds/vi [Virology];Brazil;Cloaca/vi [Virology];*Genetic Variation;*Influenza A virus/cl [Classification];Influenza A virus/ge [Genetics];*Influenza A virus/ip [Isolation & Purification];*Influenza in Birds/vi [Virology];Oropharynx/vi [Virology];Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Viral Matrix Proteins/ge [Genetics];0 (Antigens, Viral);0 (M1 protein, Influenza A virus);0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)","Araujo, J.;Petry, M.

86,Molecular features of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 prevalent in Mexico during winter seasons 2012-2014,"Since the emergence of the pandemic H1N1pdm09 virus in Mexico and California, biannual increases in the number of cases have been detected in Mexico. As observed in previous seasons, pandemic A/H1N1 09 virus was detected in severe cases during the 2011-2012 winter season and finally, during the 2013-2014 winter season it became the most prevalent influenza virus. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses of the whole viral genome are necessary to determine the antigenic and pathogenic characteristics of influenza viruses that cause severe outcomes of the disease. In this paper, we analyzed the evolution, antigenic and genetic drift of Mexican isolates from 2009, at the beginning of the pandemic, to 2014. We found a clear variation of the virus in Mexico from the 2011-2014 season due to different markers and in accordance with previous reports. In this study, we identified 13 novel substitutions with important biological effects, including virulence, T cell epitope presented by MHC and host specificity shift and some others substitutions might have more than one biological function.

88,"Co-circulation dynamics and persistence of newly introduced clades of 2012 outbreak associated West Nile Virus in Texas, 2012–2015","The second largest outbreak of West Nile encephalitis and West Nile fever ever recorded occurred in the United States (U.S) in the summer of 2012. The outbreak was related to the widespread circulation of closely related clades, or groups, of West Nile virus (WNV) into multiple states where they were not previously found. Whether the invading 2012 strains were able to circulate and overwinter in states with their own endemic population of WNV is unknown and the effect of viral genetics on adaptation and persistence in a new ecological niche is unclear. In this study, we sequenced 70 mosquito isolates from multiple counties throughout Texas in 2012–2015. We identified isolates representative of previously described 2012 WNV groups (Groups 8–10) and discovered a novel group which we called Group 11. Although we identified isolates representative of WNV endemic (2/70) to Texas, most isolates (68/70) were related to the invading 2012 strains, and of these Group 10 (45/68) was predominant. We also observed differences among the 2012 WNV groups correlating to their genotype. Group 10 WNV in Texas, which carry two putative positively selected variants, had limited introductions into Texas, wide circulation, and strong evidence of continued persistence perhaps indicative of overwintering. In contrast, Groups 8 and 11, without positively selected variants, had multiple introductions into Texas, limited circulation, and limited persistence. Lastly, we identified a potential transmission source in New York for incoming Group 8 WNV into Texas. Altogether our study suggests that mutations in the WNV genome may influence the range and dynamics of WNV circulation, and the ability of different strains to persist in new ecological niches.",animal experiment;article;cladistics;epidemic;genotype;mosquito;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;overwintering;phylogeny;population genetics;priority journal;Texas;viral genetics;virus encephalitis;virus genome;virus identification;virus isolation;virus morphology;virus mutation;virus strain;virus survival;virus transmission;West Nile fever;West Nile virus,"Aroh, C.;Liang, C.;Raj, P.;Wakeland, B.;Yan, N.;Wakeland, E.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2018.08.025,0

91,Identification of a Divergent Lineage Porcine Pestivirus in Nursing Piglets with Congenital Tremors and Reproduction of Disease following Experimental Inoculation,"Congenital tremors is a sporadic disease of neonatal pigs characterized by action-related repetitive myoclonus. A majority of outbreaks of congenital tremors have been attributed to an unidentified virus. The objectives of this project were to 1) detect potential pathogen(s) in samples from piglets with congenital tremors and 2) develop an infection model to reproduce disease. Using next-generation sequencing, a divergent lineage pestivirus was detected in piglets with congenital tremors. The virus was originally most closely related to a bat pestivirus but is now more closely related to a recently published novel porcine pestivirus provisionally named atypical porcine pestivirus. A quantitative real-time PCR detected the virus in samples from neonatal piglets with congenital tremors from two separate farms, but not in samples from unaffected piglets from the same farm. To fulfill the second objective, pregnant sows were inoculated with either serum containing the pestivirus or PBS (control) by intravenous and intranasal routes simultaneously with direct inoculation of fetal amniotic vesicles by ultrasound-guided surgical technique. Inoculations were performed at either 45 or 62 days of gestation. All sows inoculated with the novel pestivirus farrowed piglets affected with congenital tremors while PBS-inoculated control piglets were unaffected. Tremor severity for each piglet was scored from videos taken 0, 1 and 2 days post-farrowing. Tremor severity remained relatively constant from 0 to 2 days post-farrowing for a majority of piglets. The prevalence of congenital tremors in pestivirus-inoculated litters ranged from 57% (4 out of 7 affected piglets) to 100% (10 out of 10 affected piglets). The virus was consistently detected by PCR in tissues from piglets with congenital tremors but was not detected in control piglets. Samples positive by PCR in greater than 90% of piglets sampled included brainstem (37 out of 41), mesenteric lymph node (37 out of 41), tracheobronchial lymph node (37 out of 41), and whole blood (19 out of 20). Although the first description of congenital tremors was in 1922, this is the first reported reproduction of congenital tremors following experimental inoculation with a divergent lineage porcine pestivirus. Studies investigating disease mechanism, epidemiology, and diagnostic assay development are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of congenital tremors due to this pestivirus.","Animals;Female;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Pestivirus/ge [Genetics];*Pestivirus/ip [Isolation & Purification];*Pestivirus/ph [Physiology];Pregnancy;RNA, Viral/ge [Genetics];*Swine/vi [Virology];*Swine Diseases/cn [Congenital];*Swine Diseases/vi [Virology];*Tremor/cn [Congenital];*Tremor/vi [Virology];0 (RNA, Viral)","Arruda, B.

92,Genetic ancestor of external antigens of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus,"The aim of the present investigation was to discover the genetic relationships of 2009 pandemic novel influenza A/H1N1 virus (NIV) external antigens Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) with other influenza viruses by performing phylogenetic, comparative and statistical analyses. Phylogenetic trees of these two antigens show that the sequences of the NIV viruses are relatively homogeneous and these were derived from several viruses circulating in swine. The phylogenetic tree of HA shows that NIV had the closest relationship with North-American pig lineages whereas NA had with European pig lineages. In both segments, NIVs had the closest genetic relationship with swine influenza virus lineages. It strongly suggests that pigs are the most possible animal reservoir. Comparative analysis shows that among clade A, NIVs had very low genetic divergence as well as high similarity and also suffered strong purifying selection whereas neighbor clade B shows moderate values when compared to those of clades C-F. It indicates that classical swine influenza viruses present in clade B might be an ancestor of NIVs external antigens. The process of re-assortment occurred in classical swine influenza viruses. The mutation sites exclusively fixed in the NIV of swine and human along with vaccine strain provide an important suggestion for disease diagnosis and vaccine research.",Influenza virus hemagglutinin;sialidase;virus antigen;animal;article;genetics;human;influenza;Influenza A virus (H1N1);molecular evolution;mutation;nucleotide sequence;orthomyxovirus infection;phylogeny;pig;swine disease;virology,"Arunachalam, R.;Paulkumar, K.;Annadurai, G.",2012.0,,10.1007/s12539-012-0136-7,0
93,Phylogenetic analysis of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus,"The principle of the present study was to determine the evolution of pandemic novel influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus (NIV) by phylogenetic, comparative and statistical analyses. The phylogenetic trees of eight genomic segments illustrate that, so far, the sequences of the NIVs (outbreak group A) are relatively homogeneous and derived by the event of multiple genetic reassortment of Eurasian and North American swine, avian and human viruses (group B). It implies that some of the influenza viruses in group B had higher potential to evolve and getting the ability to transmit from human-to-human after animal-to-human cross-species transmission. The second analysis shows that NIV had attempted a little evolutionary change among humans and before introduction into human it had long evolutionary history. Statistical analysis shows that viruses from both outbreak and nearest group have homologous genes in their genomes which might be reflecting the phylogenetic relationship of strains, and also the presence of unique mutations between groups A-B may associate with increased virulence of NIVs. Both phylogenetic and cluster analyses confirm that the gene exchange takes place between viruses originated from different species and it could be generated NIV with unpredictable pandemic potential. Hence, we conclude that an extensive study should be made to recognize, which reassortment groups are closely related to NIVs, and to determine the sites in the genes of NIV under greatest or least selection pressure, which will ultimately be important in the effective design of vaccine and drugs for 'swine flu'.",pandemic 2009 NIV;genomic sequence;phylogeny;reassortment;evolution.;EVOLUTIONARY GENOMICS;NATURAL-SELECTION;A VIRUSES;ORIGIN;HUMANS;EMERGENCE;GENES,"Arunachalam, R.;Paulkumar, K.;Annadurai, G.",2012.0,Feb,,0
94,Subgroup determination of group a rotaviruses recovered from piglets in Nigeria,"Subgroup analysis using subgroup-specific monoclonal ELISA revealed a preponderance of subgroup 2-specific antigens of group A porcine rotaviruses over subgroup 1. Of 113 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-positive test samples, obtained from 4 States of Nigeria, 31 (27.4%) and 45 (39.8%) were determined to have subgroup 1 and 2 specificities, respectively. However, 37 (32.7%) test samples could not be classified into any of the known group A rotavirus subgroups. These 'unclassifiable' samples probably had neither subgroup 1 nor 2 specificities in ELISA or could belong to a third subgroup unknown or not investigated in this study. In all age groups investigated, subgroup 1 and 2 specific antigens were prevalent. This was also observed after yearly analysis of subgroup specificity; however, a higher prevalence of subgroup 2 specificity was observed in 1990 and 1991. Subgroup 1 rotaviruses were found in all the 4 States sampled (Plateau, Benue, Oyo, and Cross River), whereas subgroup 2 rotaviruses were detected only in Plateau State. All rotaviruses recovered in this study had long genome electrophoretic migration patterns, irrespective of subgroup. Thus genomic diversity of group A rotaviruses does not necessarily reflect antigenic diversity, as there is no mandatory correlation between genome electropherotype pattern and subgroup specificity.",virus antigen;antigenic variation;article;electrophoretic mobility;enzyme linked immunosorbent assay;geographic distribution;Nigeria;nonhuman;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis;Rotavirus;pig;virus classification;virus genome,"Atii, D.

97,Effects of orally administered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on the well-being and Salmonella colonization of young chicks,"Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a bacterium which preys upon and kills Gram-negative bacteria, including the zoonotic pathogens Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Bdellovibrio has potential as a biocontrol agent, but no reports of it being tested in living animals have been published, and no data on whether Bdellovibrio might spread between animals are available. In this study, we tried to fill this knowledge gap, using B. bacteriovorus HD100 doses in poultry with a normal gut microbiota or predosed with a colonizing Salmonella strain. In both cases, Bdellovibrio was dosed orally along with antacids. After dosing non-Salmonella-infected birds with Bdellovibrio, we measured the health and well-being of the birds and any changes in their gut pathology and culturable microbiota, finding that although a Bdellovibrio dose at 2 days of age altered the overall diversity of the natural gut microbiota in 28-day-old birds, there were no adverse effects on their growth and well-being. Drinking water and fecal matter from the pens in which the birds were housed as groups showed no contamination by Bdellovibrio after dosing. Predatory Bdellovibrio orally administered to birds that had been predosed with a gut-colonizing Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 4 strain (an important zoonotic pathogen) significantly reduced Salmonella numbers in bird gut cecal contents and reduced abnormal cecal morphology, indicating reduced cecal inflammation, compared to the ceca of the untreated controls or a nonpredatory ΔpilA strain, suggesting that these effects were due to predatory action. This work is a first step to applying Bdellovibrio therapeutically for other animal, and possibly human, infections. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.","animal;animal salmonellosis;article;bacterial count;bacterial gene;bacteriophage;Bdellovibrio;biological control agent;cecum;chicken;clinical trial;controlled clinical trial;controlled study;cell culture technique;Escherichia coli;feces;genetics;growth, development and aging;male;metagenome;microbiology;oral drug administration;pathogenicity;pathology;physiology;randomized controlled trial;Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis;body weight gain","Atterbury, R.

98,"Genetic characterization of foot-and-mouth disease viruses, Ethiopia, 1981-2007","Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. To further understand its complex epidemiology, which involves multiple virus serotypes and host species, we characterized the viruses recovered from FMD outbreaks in Ethiopia during 1981-2007. We detected 5 of the 7 FMDV serotypes (O, A, C, Southern African Territories [SAT] 1, and SAT 2). Serotype O predominated, followed by serotype A; type C was not recognized after 1983. Phylogenetic analysis of virus protein 1 sequences indicated emergence of a new topotype within serotype O, East Africa 4. In 2007, serotype SAT 1 was detected in Ethiopia and formed a new distinct topotype (IX), and serotype SAT 2 reappeared after an apparent gap of 16 years. The diversity of viruses highlights the role of this region as a reservoir for FMD virus, and their continuing emergence in Ethiopia will greatly affect spread and consequent control strategy of the disease on this continent.",viral protein;amino acid sequence;article;controlled study;Ethiopia;Foot and mouth disease virus;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;phylogeny;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;serotype;unindexed sequence,"Ayelet, G.;Mahapatra, M.;Gelaye, E.;Egziabher, B.

99,Differentiation of Proteins and Viruses Using Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography Differential Mobility Spectrometry (PY/GC/DMS) and Pattern Recognition,"It is extremely important to develop novel analytical sensors for pathogen detection. Applications of such sensors range from ensuring environmental monitoring, to providing human health diagnostic measures, and to early warning systems for bioterrorism. Certain viruses and bacteria pathogens are of special concern for their ability to spread rapidly in human populations during a pandemic, and emerging variants of these pathogens are challenging to detect. This paper provides a reliable detection strategy to classify viruses from innocuous proteins. Our novel instrumentation is based on pyrolysis gas chromatography differential mobility spectrometry (PY/GC/DMS), and couples a genetic algorithm based machine learning method for pattern recognition with a microfabricated solid state biosensor. Together, this hardware and software combination allowed for an extremely high classification accuracy (94%) between the T4 bacteriophage from bovine serum albumin (BSA), an unrelated protein. This study suggests that this portable sensor can be used along with the sophisticated data mining method as a fast, reliable, and accurate tool for the recognition of viruses.",Biosensor;differential mobility spectrometer (DMS);genetic algorithm;microelectronics;neural networks;pyrolysis;TRANSFORM-INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY;HEPATITIS-A VIRUS;MASS-SPECTROMETRY;GENETIC ALGORITHM;PCR;TECHNOLOGY;ROTAVIRUS;COMPLEXES;SPECIMENS;BACTERIA,"Ayer, S.;Zhao, W.
