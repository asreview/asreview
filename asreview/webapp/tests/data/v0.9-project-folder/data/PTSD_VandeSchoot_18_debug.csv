Irvine is a handbook for use in occupational psychology, test construction and psychometrics. The book describes the development of the British Army Recruitment Battery (BARB) by Prof. Irvine and his colleagues at the University of Plymouth. BARB is a computer-administered selection battery that is still in use to this day and is capable of developing new parallel tests for every candidate in the recruitment process. In telling the story, Sidney Irvine describes not only the development of the battery itself, funded by the UK Ministry of Defence, but all the work that went on before and afterwards, in the United Kingdom, with European allies and in the United States. Prof. Irvine argues that judicious application of the current state-of-the art in psychometric selection tests can be used to maximise retention and minimise attrition. As such, this long-awaited book will be of great interest to psychologists, psychometricians, test developers, those involved in personnel selection and all with an interest in military history, in particular the history of military science. With a foreword and chapter introductions from a worldwide array of subject matter experts, the book also has a full subject index and an extensive bibliography.

BOOK,"Kapucu, N., Hawkins, C. V., Rivera, F. I.",,,2013.0,Disaster resiliency: Interdisciplinary perspectives,Disaster resiliency: Interdisciplinary perspectives,13857,"Natural disasters in recent years have brought the study of disaster resiliency to the forefront. The importance of community preparedness and sustainability has been underscored by such calamities as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Japanese tsunami in 2011. Natural disasters will inevitably continue to occur, but by understanding the concept of resiliency as well as the factors that lead to it, communities can minimize their vulnerabilities and increase their resilience. In this volume, editors Naim Kapucu, Christopher V. Hawkins, and Fernando I. Rivera gather an impressive array of scholars to provide a much needed re-think to the topic disaster resiliency. Previous research on the subject has mainly focused on case studies, but this book offers a more systematic and empirical assessment of resiliency, while at the same time delving into new areas of exploration, including vulnerabilities of mobile home parks, the importance of asset mapping, and the differences between rural and urban locations. Employing a variety of statistical techniques and applying these to disasters in the United States and worldwide, this book examines resiliency through comparative methods which examine public management and policy, community planning and development, and, on the individual level, the ways in which culture, socio-economic status, and social networks contribute to resiliency. The analyses drawn will lead to the development of strategies for community preparation, response, and recovery to natural disasters. Combining the concept of resiliency, the factors that most account for the resiliency of communities, and the various policies and government operations that can be developed to increase the sustainability of communities in face of disasters, the editors and contributors have assembled an essential resource to scholars in emergency planning, management, and policy, as well as upper-level students studying disaster management and policy. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","School of Public Administration, University of Central Florida (UCF), Center for Public and Nonprofit Management (CPNM), United States School of Public Administration, University of Central Florida (UCF), United States University of Central Florida, United States",Scopus,Book,"['Cited By :2', 'Export Date: 10 March 2016']",1-414,Disaster Resiliency: Interdisciplinary Perspectives,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84899736093&partnerID=40&md5=11f37c9a48fb0567033468049827ee12,10.4324/9780203102459,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
BOOK,"Lampinen, J. M., Sexton-Radek, K.",,,2011.0,Protecting children from violence: Evidence-based interventions,Protecting children from violence: Evidence-based interventions,12654,"Providing an evidence-based understanding of the causes and consequences of violence against children, experts in the field examine the best practices used to help protect children from violence. Various types of violence are reviewed including physical and sexual abuse, (cyber-)bullying, human trafficking, online predators, abductions, and war. In addition, it reviews the various perpetrators of such violence including parents and relatives, strangers, other children, and societal institutions. The possible outcomes of such violence including physical injuries, death, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorders, and damage to the social fabric of the local community are also explored. To enhance accessibility, each contributor addresses common themes: • Opening case studies dramatically illustrate the human cost of abuse and neglect • Empirically driven estimates of the scope of problem to better understand who is at risk and why • Empirically driven testing of interventions to maximize effectiveness of programs • How current research compares to public perception and the impact on public policy • The worldwide problem of violence against children • Evidence-based recommendations for reducing violence against children. The book opens with a review of the history of the problem, the methodological approaches used to study it, and current –best practice— prevention strategies. The methods used to identify peer victims are then explored. Next child eyewitness memory is examined including the most effective techniques for maximizing the retrieval of information. This is followed by the research on missing and abducted children including the effectiveness of recovery programs such as supermarket campaigns and forensic age profiles. Next how the Internet is used in the victimization of children is explored including tips to help protect children online. Public attitudes toward sex offender registration laws are then reviewed followed by vulnerabilities that include genetic, neuropsychological, temperamental, cognitive, perceptual and social factors. International perspectives on protecting children from violence and global health inequities are then addressed. The book concludes with recommendations for future research. Contributors are noted scholars from a broad range of disciplines. As such, the book appeals to researchers and advanced students in developmental, counseling, clinical, cognitive, evolutionary, and social psychology, as well as sociology, social work, criminal justice, education, and law enforcement. © 2010 by Psychology Press.

BOOK,"Sharma, S.",,,2015.0,Alleviating stress of the soldier and civilian,Alleviating stress of the soldier and civilian,13997,"Initially, the author intended to write a book entitled ""Alleviating Stress of the Soldier"". However, after going through the extensive literature and recalling his childhood memories of war times, he decided to write ""Alleviating Stress of the Soldier and Civilian"". Sufficient historical evidence indicates that both soldiers as well as civilians have faced the war and tolerated its deleterious consequences simultaneously. However, a soldier and his/her family face unexpected and unpredictable stresses requiring: physical and mental fitness, character, dedication, commitment, communication, mutual understanding, adjustment, discipline, tolerance, patience, isolation, resilience, hyper-vigilance, minimum vulnerability, sanitation, nutritional stress, sleep deprivation, patriotism, and sacrifice. This book(i) confers basic knowledge of diversified stresses; (ii) prepares readers to face stresses with patience, endurance, and resilience; (iii) and presents novel strategies of alleviating physical, psychological, and physiological stresses of war-wounded soldiers, prisoners of war (POWs), and veterans. The book guides the soldiers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, SEALS (sea, air, and land), POWs, and civilians to handle their professional and family stresses without having to suffer from Combat Stress Reaction (CSR) or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) before, during, and/or after the war or conflict. It also guides those who experienced early childhood neglect, physical and/or sexual abuse, and other stresses of diversified origin. It is envisaged that this timely released book will be particularly of great interest to the soldier's family members, their spouses, children, parents, relatives, and friends because of its motivational messages, immediate demand, and versatility. The author hopes that this unique manuscript will encourage, motivate, excite, and guide young soldiers, civilians, and their families to tackle stresses with courage, patience, and resilience to successfully accomplish their trainings, adventurous professional career, and married life. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Campus sexual violence is widely acknowledged to be a problem. However, reported data on the extent of sexual violence at IHEs varies considerably across studies for a variety of methodological and other reasons. Victims of sexual violence may suffer from a range of physical and mental health conditions including injuries, pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidality, and substance abuse.

The authors explore previous research on psychological responses to warfare while providing background information on the Sierra Leone civil war and its context. Chapters consider particular groups of survivors, including former child soldiers, as well as amputee footballers, mental health service users and providers, and refugees. Implications of the themes emerging from this research are considered with respect to how new understandings can inform current models of trauma and work with its survivors. Amongst the issues concerned will be post-traumatic stress and post-traumatic growth; resilience; mental health service provision; perpetration of atrocities; and forgiveness. The book also provides a critical consideration of the appropriateness of the use of Western concepts and methods in an African context.

Critical incidents are situations and incidents within workplace settings or roles, which, whilst able to be anticipated and planned for, have the potential to create a sense of emergency, crisis, and extreme stress, or have a traumatic impact on those directly or indirectly affected. Alongside the notion of critical incidents are concepts of debriefing, psychological debriefing, critical incident stress debriefing (CISD), and critical incident stress management (CISM). Debate about debriefing models has concerned their effectiveness and safety; the terms being loaded with meaning and tensions between scientific and holistic paradigms and between academic and practitioner perspectives.

A vehicle struck GH at moderate speed while he was cycling to work during rush-hour traffic and, as a result, he was flipped over the handlebars and thrown against a building wall. He hit his head, cracking the helmet he was wearing, and sustained multiple soft tissue injuries to his neck, upper back, and shoulders that were considered mild in nature. GH was deemed to be not at fault for the accident, and his insurance company replaced his bicycle and helmet and covered his hospital expenses and wage loss. He took 6 weeks off work and resumed fulltime employment after receiving a transfer 6 months after the accident. During his intake interview, GH reported having difficulty performing his job and being easily irritated by colleagues. On examination, he was found to meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD, with scores on various assessment instruments indicating his symptoms to be severe. He was also moderately depressed and was experiencing daily pain in his neck and back, which, although fluctuating in severity from mild to moderate, had persisted over the past 9 months. There is a growing body of research that indicates clearly that Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain frequently co-occur. People with both PTSD and chronic pain tend to have greater distress and impairment compared to those with only one of these conditions and, as might be expected, assessment and treatment are more complicated. The cooccurrence of these conditions is, unfortunately, often overlooked in clinical practice and, as a result, treatment outcomes are often less encouraging than hoped. The present chapter has several goals. First, we briefly review the core characteristics of PTSD and chronic pain, and present data regarding the extent of their co-occurrence. Second, we summarize cognitive-behavioral models that have been offered to explain the co-occurrence of these conditions and briefly review the supporting evidence. Third, we explore specific areas of overlap between PTSD symptom clusters and the cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physiological aspects of chronic pain. Fourth, elaborating on the case of GH introduced earlier, we describe practical implications stemming from key aspects of the cognitive-behavioral models that might improve outcomes for people with co-occurring PTSD and chronic pain. We close that chapter by noting several issues that warrant future research attention.","University of Regina, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 2A1, Canada",Scopus,,"['Cited By :7', 'Export Date: 14 January 2015']",225-241,"Psychological Knowledge in Court: PTSD, Pain, and TBI",http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84892283215&partnerID=40&md5=dca873e047bfeb51e49fa170ddda7a83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Accordingly, while attempting to draw the profile of the high-risk patient for PTSD, the following factors should be included, among others: The history of previous trauma, the history of previous psychiatric disorder, female gender, ethnic minority, high severity of initial posttraumatic symptoms (ASR), associated body injury, “high-risk” traumatic event (man-made trauma), and peri-traumatic dissociation.

Any of these things can and all too often do happen, and at every stage of life. Epidemiological data indicate that most adults experience at least one and usually several potentially traumatic events (PTE) during the course of their lives (Norris, 1992; Kessler et al., 1995; Breslau et al., 2000), and that most children are also exposed to such experiences (Copeland et al., 2007). It is important to note, however, that life event research typically relies on retrospective accounts, which more than likely underestimate the frequency of PTEs. Indeed, a recent study that measured life events among college students over a four-year period using a weekly internet survey reported an average of six PTEs per student (Lalande & Bonanno, 2011). Perhaps because acutely aversive events are so dreaded, both clinicians and the lay public tend to assume that they will almost always result in lasting emotional damage. The available evidence, however, suggests a more complex and far more encouraging picture. To emphasize the pronounced individual differences in the way people react to adversity, we emphasize that such events are only “potentially traumatic” (Norris, 1992; Bonanno, 2004), for the simple reason that not everyone experiences them as traumatic. Most people in fact cope with PTEs remarkably well (Bonanno, 2004, 2005; Bonanno & Mancini, 2008). Although some do, in fact, endure lasting emotional difficulties, the vast majority of people exposed to extreme adversity recover a semblance of their normal level of functioning within several months to several years after the event, and many if not most show little evidence of more than transient disruptions in functioning. © Cambridge University Press 2011.","Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, United States",Scopus,,['Export Date: 10 March 2016'],120-134,Resilience and Mental Health: Challenges Across the Lifespan,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84923804524&partnerID=40&md5=1b28e6f48da416d141bbf94ad288e45f,10.1017/CBO9780511994791.010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

The post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) consists of a cluster of signs and symptoms developed in response to an extreme traumatic stressor. The general population prevalence of PTSD is estimated to range between 2-15%, whereas the prevalence in risk groups is reported to vary from 3-58%. These variations may be due to several factors: the prevalence of trauma exposure, the magnitude and quality of the stressor/s, differences in individual vulnerability, discordances in psychosocial narratives, and their consideration of resilience and distress, and the methodology that is being used in each study. The response to trauma depends on pre-trauma, peri-trauma, and post-trauma variables. Trauma may lead to a persistent failure of the inhibitory processes ruled mainly by the frontal cortex over a fear-motivated hyperresponsive limbic system. From an evolutionary perspective, the main psychobiological circuits involved in emotions related to fear and anger are primitive, and they have their basis in ancient sub-cortical regions, whereas well-developed cortical regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, play a modulatory role. Abnormalities in the balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurocircuits could also be involved in the pathophysiology of PTSD. However, a comprehensive multi-level approach to trauma should not only focus on the basic psychobiological mechanisms but also on the specific psychosocial context within which the response to trauma developes. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The aim of this chapter is to review the evidence for psychological and pharmacological approaches to treating people with adverse psychological reactions after disaster; specifically, we focus on interventions that can be provided in the short and intermediate phases after disaster. First we review common postdisaster psychiatric disorders. We then turn to describing and outlining the evidence for psychological approaches to treatment. Next we review pharmacological treatments for posttraumatic conditions. Finally, we comment on factors that influence the management of psychological approaches in the acute postdisaster environment. PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DISASTERS There is convergent evidence that an array of psychiatric disorders arise after disasters. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most commonly identified, and the disorder is characterized by three clusters of symptoms, including reexperiencing of the traumatic event, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. Symptoms need to be present for at least 1 month and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning to fulfill criteria for PTSD. Rates of PTSD were reported in 34% of survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing (North et al., 1999) and 53% after Australian bushfires (McFarlane, 1986). Across studies, the prevalence of PTSD is higher among direct victims (30%–40%) than rescue personnel (10%–20%; Neria, Nandi, & Galea, 2007). © Cambridge University Press 2009.","School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, United States National Center for PTSD, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States",Scopus,,"['Cited By :6', 'Export Date: 10 February 2016']",321-335,Mental Health and Disasters,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-80052636635&partnerID=40&md5=1384c08595b0ccefb3770ac81e752426,10.1017/CBO9780511730030.019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Adjustment to disability, both physical and psychological, may require some time, especially since the lesion's final diagnosis may not be absolutely definite until up to two years post-injury. Under such conditions, one would expect individuals with SCI to be highly vulnerable to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition defined by the experience of a traumatic event, along with clusters of symptoms that are associated with this traumatic experience. Surprisingly, the literature reveals that individuals with SCI do not necessarily develop PTSD, and that the most severely handicapped individuals are not necessarily the most vulnerable to PTSD development. This chapter covers the definition of PTSD, along with its prevalence across studies, and explores the factors that are associated with its development. Risk factors for PTSD associated with SCI cover the individual's characteristics, including psychological variables such as locus of control and intolerance to uncertainty, along with the individual's reactions at the time of injury, including emotions, dissociations, and perceived threats to life, which appear to be most significant in predicting PTSD following an SCI. Physical consequences of the lesion, in contrast, do not seem to bear the most significant risks, except for the presence of pain (neurogenic, surgical or postural) and for that of social support, especially from friends, which appears to rather protect against PTSD development. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Since that time, the diagnostic criteria have been refined, with both the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and international classification of diseases (ICD-10) (World Health Organization, 1993) recognizing the condition. In recent years, a major focus of interest has been the impact of gender on the risk of developing PTSD and related conditions following traumatic exposure. Indeed, the fact that a whole book has recently been devoted to a comprehensive review of issues concerning PTSD and gender (Kimerling et al., 2002) is an indication of the importance placed on this relationship. While interested readers are referred to that volume for a more in-depth analysis of the area, the purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the key issues concerning women and PTSD The nature of PTSD The first criterion to be met for a diagnosis of PTSD is the experience of a traumatic event (Criterion A1), usually defined as involving actual or threatened physical threat to the self or others. The person&#x0027;s response to the event must have involved a powerful emotional reaction, such as fear, helplessness, or horror (Criterion A2). Three broad clusters of symptoms characterize the disorder and are required in some form for a diagnosis.

Since then, a large body of research on the presentation and treatment of PTSD has been assembled. A number of efficacious cognitive–behavioral therapies (CBTs) are now offered, such as prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy (CPT; [3]), and the rates of successful treatment in a variety of populations are improving. Symptoms and diagnostic criteria In the DSM-IV-TR, there are six diagnostic criteria (Criterion A-F) that must be present for a diagnosis of PTSD. First, the individual must have experienced a traumatic event (Criterion A) during which: (1) the person experienced or witnessed an event or events that involved actual threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others; and (2) the person's reaction involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror (in children this may present as agitated or disorganized behavior). Examples of traumatic events include serious threats to life or physical integrity such as military combat, sexual assault, motor vehicle accidents, physical assault, natural or human-made disasters, or witnessing violence or severe human suffering. The symptoms of PTSD are categorized into three clusters in DSM-IV (Criterion B, C, and D): intrusive recollection, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal symptoms. © Cambridge University Press 2010.","Behavioral Science Division National Center, Boston, MA, United States",Scopus,,['Export Date: 10 February 2016'],107-120,Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy with Adults: A Guide to Empirically-Informed Assessment and Intervention,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84927038016&partnerID=40&md5=c66b05cd379dbdf94fef8a8ec7fa1195,10.1017/CBO9780511781919.010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

I., Gomez, M.",,,2013.0,Posttraumatic stress disorder among outpatients with visible and invisible electrical injury,Posttraumatic stress disorder among outpatients with visible and invisible electrical injury,540,"Introduction: Electrical injury (EI) is the most common form of occupational burn injury. While rates of psychological distress have been found to be high among all burn-injured patients, EI patients have additional unique and complex features. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently seen in burn-injured patients include elevated anxiety, re-experiencing the trauma through repeated disturbing memories, flashbacks and nightmares, avoidance, hyper-vigilance, concentration and memory problems, as well as sleeping difficulties. Among EI patients, additional features can include complaints of high levels of pain in the absence of a visible physical injury, and/or cognitive difficulties, which can further complicate PTSD symptomatology and the course of rehabilitation. Understanding the importance of screening and specialty assessment of PTSD among this population is critical to improving their functioning and quality of life. Nevertheless, PTSD has been shown to be underdiagnosed in medical settings.Objective: This chapter presents an investigation of the psychological profile of a group of EI patients in rehabilitation, with a focus on PTSD severity (clinical PTSD, subclinical PTSD and no PTSD) and comorbidity, the role of visibility of the EI injury, and predictors for their PTSD diagnosis.Assessment measures: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory - II (BDI-II).Conclusion: The high levels of psychiatric distress among EI patients in rehabilitation reported in this chapter demonstrate their need for psychological attention. The finding that no differences were noted between visibility injury groups reveals that those with invisible EI injuries can present with complex psychiatric needs, comparable to those with visible injuries. Comorbid PTSD and depression were the highest diagnostic condition found amongst the visible EI group, a fact that invites further inquiry as to whether the invisible nature of the patients' injury plays a role in their psychiatric care, from either the patient's or the referring clinicians' perspective. In spite of overall high levels of psychiatric distress, outpatients with invisible injuries were referred much later for a psychological assessment, a fact that warrants further exploration. Early screening to identify EI patients with PTSD symptomatology throughout the process of recovery, and particularly during rehabilitation, is necessary. The current finding that the PCL-C predicted PTSD in this population confirms the usefulness of this tool with EI patients, regardless of the visibility of their injury. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

CHAP,"Habukawa, M., Maeda, M., Uchimura, N.",,,2010.0,Sleep disturbances in posttraumatic stress disorder,Sleep disturbances in posttraumatic stress disorder,9499,"Sleep disturbances are common complaints among patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as intrusive recollection, avoidance of disturbing stimuli, difficulty in concentration, and depressive symptoms. Patients with PTSD frequently report difficulty falling or staying asleep and recurrent nightmares related to the traumatic events. These sleep disturbances are part of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD and are included in both the re-experiencing (Criterion B) and increased arousal (Criterion D) symptom cluster in the DSM-IV-TR. Despite these sleep complaints, polysomnographic studies have not provided consistent evidence of sleep disturbances, especially regarding non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, the characteristic sleep disturbances, in particular the repetitive, stereotypical nightmares may be relatively specific to PTSD. The presence of nightmares in PTSD has been hypothesized as a dysfunction of REM sleep mechanisms and investigators have reported various types of REM sleep abnormalities. Treatment studies also have shown that antidepressants, such as nefazodone, trazodone, fluvoxamine, and image rehearsal therapy are beneficial in the treatment of PTSD-related sleep disturbances as well as core symptoms of this anxiety disorder; however, these sleep disturbances may persist and impair the quality of life in PTSD patients for several decades. It is important, therefore, to understand the characteristics of sleep disturbances in PTSD and these treatments. In this review, we discuss the clinical features and objective findings of sleep disturbances in PTSD and these treatments based on the published literature, including our findings. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Methods The sample of 225 pupils (112 females and 113 males) aged of 15.1±2.1 years were evaluated for assessment of war traumatic events, acculturation, neuroticism, school behavioral problems; and presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The sample was divided into group of participants from eastern Bosnian region (Srebrenica and Podrinje) (n=143) who had been exposed to the war catastrophes in their original region, and survived Srebrenica catastrophe 1995 and a group of participants from north-east Bosnian region (Semberija and Posavina), who were exposed to the war catastrophes in the first beginning of war, in April 1992 and became refugees during the whole war and after it (n=82). Results In both groups, refugee and internally displaced adolescents had been exposed to severe war trauma and had reported high level of trauma more than three years after the war. Among participants from Srebrenica region we found 52 of 143 (36.4%) participants lost father what is significantly more than participants from Semberija region 7 of 82 (8.5%) (Chi-square=20.860, df=1, P<0.001), significantly more children from Srebrenica 94 of 143 (65.7%), stayed in homeland and survived additional trauma exposure to war catastrophes as refugees in so called -free territory?, after survived war experiences in 1992, while from Semberija region only 22 of 82 (26.8%) experienced whole war period out of original places (Chi-square=31.583, df=1, P<0.001). The level of trauma severity (mean±standard deviation = 4.3±0.9 on a scale from 0-5), and stress level 2.0±1.2 were higher among adolescents and internally displaced from Srebrenica than among those from Semberija (4.1±1.1 and 1.7±1.1, respectively) but not significantly (p=0.150; P=0.072, respectively, t-test). The level severity of re-experience cluster symptoms, (mean±standard deviation = 2.5±1.4 on a scale from 0-5) were significantly higher among adolescents from Srebrenica than among those from Semberija region (1.9±1.2, t-test=3.255, P=0.001). The prevalence of PTSD statistically significantly differed between Srebrenica group (67.8%) and Semberija group of respondents (52.4%) (Chi-square=5.253, df=1, P=0.022). Participants from Srebrenica had significantly more acculturation problems for: Missed friends during exile/displacement, Wanted to return to native place/homeland, Listened to news from native place/homeland and Had alimentary problems after being exiled/displaced (p<0.05), and there were no statistically significant differences for the rest of listed acculturation problems between groups. According the T-score of Achenbach check list, (mean±standard deviation on the scale from 0-100), from Srebrenica reported significantly more severe anxious depressed behavior (58.8±10.7) than their peers from Semberija (54.9±8.9) (t-test=7.782, P=0.006); they reported significantly more severe withdrawn depressed behavior too (57.6±11.2; 53.4±9.5 respectively) (t-test=8.226, P=0.005), also they reported significantly more severe internalizing problems (57.3±9.0; 54.1±7.5 respectively) (t-test=7.309, P=0.007). Participants from Srebrenica had more severe thought problems (54.5±8.0; 51.6±6.0 respectively) (t-test=8.082, P=0.005), as well as significantly more expressed attention problems (53.0±4.5; 51.8±3.5 respectively) (t-test=4.583, P=0.033). The prevalence of anxious-depressed behavior in clinical range among Srebrenica participants 24 of 143 (16.8%) were significantly higher than among their peers from Semberija 8 of 82 (9.8%) (Chi square=9.611, P=0.008), also the prevalence of thought problems were significantly more expressed among Srebrenica adolescents 13 of 143 (9.1%) related to 5 of 82 (6.1%) (Chi-square=7.143, P=0.028). Adolescents from Srebrenica reported significantly lower activeness, 66 of 143 (46.2%) which is under average activeness, related to 21 of 82 (25.6%) am ng children from Semberija (Chi-square=10.408, P=0.005). Sociability among children from Srebrenica with over average sociability 80 of 143 (55.4%) were significantly less than among children from Semberija 59 of 82 (72.0%) (Chi-square=6.836, P=0.033). Adolescents from Srebrenica were significantly more introverted 31 of 143 (21.7%) than their peers 11 of 82 (13.4%), but less extroverted 25 of 243 (17.5%) related to 29 of 82 (35.4%) (Chi-square=9.692, P=0.008). The severity of trauma experiences and stress level highly correlated with severity of neuroticism (Pearson r=0.394, P<0.001; r=0.551, P<0.001 respectively), but negatively highly correlated with sociability (r=-0.170, P=0.011; r=-0.3, P<0.001). Stress level severity highly correlated with level of activeness (r=0.145, P=0.030). Conclusions Bosnia-Herzegovina refugee and internally displaced adolescents, 3.5 years after war, suffer from PTSD very frequently. Adolescents from Srebrenica region suffered significantly more from PTSD, acculturation problems, anxious/depressed behavior problems, and thought problems. Also they were significantly less active, less sociable, and less extroverted, in other words they were significantly more introverted. Professionals and institutions involved in education and mental health care of adolescents should develop programs to address this after war outcomes among young population. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Despite the need to understand correlates of adjustment so as to optimize clinical and psychosocial services among Chinese people with CRC, very little is known about these people. Distinct sociocultural backgrounds warrant cautions in transferring the findings in the West to Asian populations. This chapter presents a series of psychosocial studies, ranging from qualitative interviews to validation of psychometric instruments and multi-wave prospective studies, in samples of Chinese CRC patients in Hong Kong. A qualitative study identifies the dynamics of the adaptation process and specific issues faced by Chinese CRC patients throughout the illness trajectory. Based on the qualitative findings, psychometric self-report instruments are developed to validly and reliably capture the socioculturally-specific issues of adjustment in Asian cancer patients. Longitudinal studies then seek to explore the psychological mechanisms that might inform the development of psychological services for Asian patients as well as those in the West.

Clearly, understanding how such exposure to disaster affects children's mental health and psychosocial development is important, both for elucidating vulnerabilities specific to children, and for informing and guiding appropriate responses, including treatment, which fosters resilience and speeds recovery. The greatest promise for advancing knowledge on this topic depends upon systematic assessment, using diagnostic-based measures in well-designed, longitudinal investigations of representative samples of children (in sufficient numbers) to allow for meaningful analyses. Unfortunately, to date, no study with children that includes all of these elements could be identified. As a nascent field of inquiry, disaster mental health research in children is now ideally poised to review its own recent research, including emphasis and approach, so as to determine a future trajectory. In an effort to stimulate and facilitate this process and to identify critical knowledge gaps, this chapter systematically examines the extant literature, focusing on methodological issues.

Service members, their romantic partners, and their children have handled the increased operational tempo of deployments resulting from both Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) with impressive resilience (Bonanno et al., 2012; Cozza, Chun, and Polo, 2005; Lester et al., 2010), although the challenges of war can take a substantial toll on people’s physical health (Badr, Barker, and Milbury, 2011; Gorman, Eide, and Hilse-Gorman, 2010), mental health (Mansfield et al., 2010; Milliken, Auchterlonie, and Hoge, 2007; Pfefferbaum et al., 2011), and relationship health (Adams, Durand, and Castro, 2006; Allen et al., 2010; Nelson Goff et al., 2007). One foundation of this resilience is undoubtedly the strong military identity that many families embrace. US military culture espouses the ideals of courage, fortitude, strength, fairness, discipline, loyalty, respect for authority, determination, and valor (Coll, Weiss, and Yarvis, 2011; Greene et al., 2010b; Ulmer, Collins, and Jacobs, 2000), and these qualities are the signature values of many active duty and reserve component military families (Hall, 2008). To be a US military family is to be proud, to be strong, and to be brave (Hall 2011a; 2011b; Park, 2011). Although military culture provides a pervasive backdrop for how service members and their families navigate domestic life (Hall 2008; 2011a; Sherman and Bowling, 2011), scholarship on the interpersonal functioning of military couples and families has not always been sensitive to the unique parameters at play. With some notable exceptions (Palmer, 2008; Pincus et al., 2001; Riggs and Riggs, 2011), scholars have tended to apply established theories of relationship functioning to the military context without fully taking into account the social circumstances that envelop military personnel, their romantic partners, and their children. The result is a body of work (including some of our own research) that underemphasizes the distinctive trademarks of military life. As Wiens and Boss (2006) noted, ""To understand how best to support today’s military families, it is essential to understand their contexts. What are the contextual sources of their stress and resiliency?"" (p. 25).

As violence is highly prevalent in many societies individuals who have been exposed to violence have also grown old. There is limited knowledge about the long-term implications of early exposure into late life. Elder abuse has become a major issue in public health; however, the elderly are also victims to crime, war, atrocities in society, and trauma from disasters. The mental health implications of exposure to violence are reviewed, in particular post-traumatic stress disorder. Controlled studies on treatment of older individuals exposed to violence are rare. The findings suggest that exposure to violence in childhood, as a young adult or as an elder all have adverse effects on mental health in old age. The trajectory of these mental health outcomes suggests that the elderly may have a path of resilience. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015","Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Brown University, United States Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, United States Department of Epidemiology, Brown University, United States",Scopus,,['Export Date: 10 February 2016'],153-184,Violence and Mental Health: Its Manifold Faces,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84943329397&partnerID=40&md5=795e5044ed8f96b6b6f2c471f5d6168b,10.1007/978-94-017-8999-8_8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

In view of the adolescent tendency not to self-disclose, pro-active screening for trauma in the population of addicted adolescents, as well as screening for substance abuse in those who had experienced trauma, is highly indicated. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States",Scopus,,['Export Date: 14 January 2015'],350-361,Clinical Handbook of Adolescent Addiction,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84886821991&partnerID=40&md5=c15d9daf5f1f62d55d0bd57814223b27,,,,"['Addiction', 'Addictive disorders', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohol', 'PTSD', 'Substance abuse', 'Trauma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

In fact, these potentially traumatic events can lead to the development of acute stress disorder (ASD) and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cause significant psychological impairment. In this chapter, we discuss the types of potentially traumatic events that lead to ASD or PTSD in youth, as well as various aspects of trauma exposure. We next review available evidence on the definition, prevalence, and course of ASD and PTSD in youth, and the risk factors associated with their development. To date, relatively few studies have examined ASD and existing evidence calls into question the validity of dissociative symptoms as part of the existing ASD diagnostic criteria for youth. In contrast, many studies have evaluated PTSD and its symptoms in youth exposed to trauma, although PTSD prevalence rates vary substantially depending on a host of factors, including the type of traumatic event experienced, the degree of exposure to the event, and the informant for PTSD symptoms, among other factors. We also discuss developmental considerations for the ASD and PTSD diagnoses and directions for future research. The chapter closes with a brief summary of proposed changes to the diagnostic criteria for ASD and PTSD in youth that are being considered for the DSM-5. © 2012 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

CHAP,"Liberzon, I., Martis, B.",,,2006.0,Functional neuroimaging research in posttraumatic stress disorder,Functional neuroimaging research in posttraumatic stress disorder,10156,"Neuroimaging research in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is only two decadesold, but is rapidly expanding and evolving in methodological sophistication (Pitmanet al. 2001; Hull 2002; Liberzon and Phan 2003). Earlier structural and symptom-provocation studies are giving way to hypothesis-driven cognitive activationstudies, longitudinal and treatment studies, and translationally driven integrativestudies. The focused review of functional neuroimaging research in PTSD that followsdiscusses findings to better understand the functional neuroanatomy underlyingPTSD symptoms and pathophysiology. We begin with a selective review of theresearch on functional neuroanatomy of emotions that is specifically relevant toPTSD. The ensuing discussion links the two bodies of literature in order to providea better understanding of the processing of threat-related emotions and how this informsour understanding of the brain mechanisms that subserve PTSD.PTSD is characterized by exposure to life-threatening event/s associated withintense emotional reactions. Symptom clusters consist of reexperiencing the trauma(such as nightmares and intrusive memories), avoidance and numbing (avoidingtrauma-related cues, feeling emotionally distant from loved ones), and hyperarousal(hypervigilance, sleep disturbances) (American Psychiatric Association 2000). Becausethese criteria are descriptive, atheoretical, and not confined to a specific diagnosis,it is possible that patients with different neurobiological subtypes will sharethe same diagnosis or that patients with similar neurobiological abnormalities maycross descriptive categorical boundaries. Neurobiological evidence does offer thepotential to identify findings specific to trauma exposure and/or to PTSD's symptomsand pathophysiology, thereby helping to differentiate, define, and treat thesedisorders in a more meaningful way.One powerful, noninvasive means of investigating brain function in PTSD is theuse of relatively new neuroimaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). MRI methodology relies on spinproperties of protons in human brain tissue to outline brain structures and estimate their volume. Functional MRI (fMRI) uses the paramagnetic properties of oxy- anddeoxyhemoglobin in conjunction with rapid acquisition sequences to create maps ofblood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal activity, i.e., blood flow reflective ofneuronal firing, thereby allowing the study of neural processing of specific tasks.Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and PET use radio-emittingisotopes of biologically relevant molecules to estimate blood flow, metabolicrate, receptor binding, and quantification and the assessment of pharmacologicalactivity in vivo.","Trauma Stress and Anxiety Research Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of MichiganAnn Arbor, United States",Scopus,,"['Cited By :1', 'Export Date: 14 January 2015']",211-233,PTSD: Brain Mechanisms and Clinical Implications,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-33947578701&partnerID=40&md5=cdc913e5dd9a2a0bbf4ee1d0be2471a6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

A.",,,2011.0,Loss and grief: The role of individual differences,Loss and grief: The role of individual differences,13910,"It is an unfortunate but inevitable fact of life that virtually all of us must face: people we are close to die. Despite this universality, researchers and theorists have long assumed that bereavement almost always results in significant, and sometimes incapacitating, distress. Curiously, the absence of distress after loss has itself been considered pathological and a likely harbinger of future difficulties (Middleton et al., 1993). When bereaved persons fail to display the expected distress reaction, some have maintained that they are suppressing their grief (Middleton et al., 1993) or lack an attachment to their spouse (Fraley & Shaver, 1999). Indeed, emotional expression following loss – particularly negative emotions – has long been considered cathartic, a necessary ingredient of healthy adjustment (Freud, 1957). Perhaps for this reason, bereaved people who appear outwardly resilient and who resume their lives with minimal disruptions have often been thought to possess extraordinary coping abilities. However, this idea has increasingly come under fire (Bonanno, 2004). In fact, most bereaved people experience relatively transient disruptions in their ability to function effectively. Furthermore, research increasingly shows that there is a marked diversity in how people respond to loss. Indeed, it appears that three primary patterns or trajectories adequately describe most people’s response to interpersonal loss. The largest category, usually from 50% to 60%, is characterized by stable, healthy levels of psychological and physical functioning relatively soon after a loss, or “resilience” (Bonanno, 2004; Mancini & Bonanno, 2006). A second category of bereaved persons (20–25%) displays more acute and persistent levels of distress but gradually they too recover their bearings and return to their former level of functioning. The most problematic reaction is found among those with a persistent syndrome of a sometimes incapacitating distress that may take years to resolve. This pattern, often described as “complicated grief” (Bonanno et al., 2007), is relatively rare, typically occurring in 10–15% of grievers (Bonanno & Kaltman, 2001). Two other types of bereavement response have also emerged recently, although they typically characterize only a small proportion of grievers. These include a chronic form of distress that predated the loss and is exacerbated in its aftermath (Bonanno et al., 2002; Mancini et al., 2011) and dramatic improvement following loss (A.D. Mancini, I. Galatzer-Levy, & G.A. Bonanno, unpublished data). Although each is quite uncommon (5–10%), these patterns have been confirmed using different methods and samples, suggesting that they are veridical. © Cambridge University Press 2011.","Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, United States",Scopus,,"['Cited By :3', 'Export Date: 10 March 2016']",189-199,Resilience and Mental Health: Challenges Across the Lifespan,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84857363513&partnerID=40&md5=80f05b46207d796ec302345699d95414,10.1017/CBO9780511994791.015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
CHAP,"Matsubayashi, H., Hosaka, T., Makino, T.",,,2012.0,Impact of psychological distress in infertile Japanese women,Impact of psychological distress in infertile Japanese women,788,"Infertile women in Japan as well as in the Western World have high levels of emotional distress, which include anxiety and depression. By cross-sectional questionnaire study, both scores of the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and the profile of mood states (POMS) for infertile Japanese women were high, indicating psychologically disturbed. In Japan, women are frequently greeted with traditional questions such as, 'Are you married? Do you have a child?' Elderly Japanese may project guilt on women without children, because they believe women should fulfill a role by producing an heir and/or heiress to continue the family name. This can cast shame and/or guilt on the infertility patients, and thus produce undo stress on women labeled as infertile. Therefore, infertile Japanese women should be supported by psychiatric intervention. In view of Immunology, natural-killer (NK) cell activity of the infertile Japanese women was significantly higher than that of the control. Elevated NK-cell activity is observed temporarily during stressful events. Persistent low NK-cell activity is associated with depression or stressful events caused by natural disasters. To the contrary, persistent high NK-cell activity is uncommon, however, increased NK-cell activity is observed in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss or Vietnam combat veterans diagnosed with long-term post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A long-term chronic stress may underpin the basis for persistently high NK-cell activities. In consideration with high NK-cell activity for pregnancy, an embryo might be rejected from the uterus, because of its killing activity. Therefore, a randomized study was performed to clarify the effects of psychiatric group intervention on the emotions, NK-cell activity and pregnancy rate in infertile Japanese women. Thirty-seven women completed a 5-session intervention program and were compared with 37 controls. Psychological discomfort and NK-cell activity significantly decreased after the intervention, whereas no significant changes were observed in controls. The pregnancy rate in the intervention group was significantly higher than that of controls. Psychological group intervention was effective in infertile Japanese women. Finally, an interesting case was observed to achieve pregnant in a 50-year old Japanese woman with psychological relief. After failure of conception with 6 IVF attempts, the couple decided to discontinue further IVF treatment at age 48 years. One and one-half years later, she became pregnant naturally, resulting in getting healthy baby. During the time spanning her treatment for infertility, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue and grief were revealed to coexist with her high hopes of having a child. After termination of infertility treatments these adverse psychological findings were markedly lessened and her vigor was restored. Stopping infertility treatment might be a viable alternative for achieving pregnancy in similarly psychologically-challenged infertile women. We believe that reproductive psychology will be one of the main topics in the field of fertility and sterility in the 21st century. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

CHAP,"Mc Farlane, A. C., Van Hooff, M., Goodhew, F.",,,2009.0,Anxiety disorders and PTSD,Anxiety disorders and PTSD,13920,"INTRODUCTION This chapter reviews the literature on the prevalence and etiology of anxiety disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), following disasters. We highlight that there is relatively little information about anxiety disorders other than PTSD; the paucity of data is due to the challenge of the shared phenomenology of these disorders and the difficulty of defining their boundaries. A further challenge is explored, namely, how disasters interact with background morbidity in a community. In considering the etiology of anxiety disorders, the differential role of threat is hypothesized to be differentiated from the more enduring effect of the losses sustained in disasters. Anxiety disorders have an enduring effect in the aftermath of disasters, and many issues remain to be examined in future research, especially in expanding beyond PTSD. To begin, however, it is important to understand the settings in which disasters occur and the anticipations that abound following these events, as these have the potential to bias a rational appraisal of the challenges that will impact the affected community. Managing the psychological impact of disasters is a critical public-health challenge in the aftermath of these events. Informed prevalence and incidence estimates are critical to effective service planning. Unfortunately, there is often dramatization of disaster impact immediately afterward, with fears expressed about the capacity of the population to function and manage effectively (de Ville de Goyet, 2007). © Cambridge University Press 2009.","University of Adelaide, The Centre for Military and Veterans' Health, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Scopus,,"['Cited By :11', 'Export Date: 10 March 2016']",47-66,Mental Health and Disasters,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-79953254119&partnerID=40&md5=edd337408417e3fd0556c26150f72848,10.1017/CBO9780511730030.004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

African American populations have been shown to distrust professional and formal care services, have lower acceptance of mental health treatment and are less informed concerning treatment decisions compared to their white counterparts. These differences affect several mental health-related decisions, such as taking medications, accessing medical interventions and overall acceptance of formal mental health care. As African Americans are less likely to use mental health services, the individual and family remain at a higher risk for dysfunctional family interactions, emotional and physical distress, and various negative health consequences. To address this concern, this chapter will review scholarly literature on differences in African American views of mental health care in comparison to Whites. In addition, the literature will be reviewed concerning how these differing views and lifestyle factors influence use of mental health care. This literature review will specifically address the following: 1) a brief description of posttraumatic stress disorder, 2) issues related to the racial, cultural, and economic factors related to Black Americans' use of formal mental health services, 3) examine the consequences of posttraumatic stress and underutilization of mental health care for Black Americans and ) describe recommendations for professionals in bridging the gap between Black Americans' perspectives and mental health treatment. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

CHAP,"Minelli, A., Maffioletti, E.",,,2014.0,Genetics of anxiety disorders,Genetics of anxiety disorders,12750,"There is considerable evidence that genetic determinants could play a role in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders. Linkage studies, association studies and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified genetic profiles associated with anxiety disorders such as panic disorder (PD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD). There is not one specific gene that causes anxiety, but combinations of genes seem to be at play. Furthermore, environmental factors, like stressful life events, may trigger an anxiety disorder more easily in people who have a genetic predisposition to the illness. However, the mechanisms are far from a complete understanding. To date, the most studied genetic variant is the serotonin transporter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), which has been indicated as a risk factor for anxiety disorders, also affecting relative treatments. Other studies regarding the genetic susceptibility to anxiety disorders have focused on studying variants in neurotrophic genes (e.g., BDNF) and in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) related genes (e.g., FKBP5, CRHR1, NR3C1). In particular, candidate gene approach studies have investigated variants in genes related to HPA and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) pathways because of their central role in the adaptation of the organism to stress. Finally, investigations of susceptibility genes for anxiety disorders can be helped from the study of the genetic factors underlying personality traits, such as neuroticism and harm avoidance, that constitute risk factors for anxiety disorders. The identification of genetic variants involved in anxiety may have implications for the optimization of therapeutic interventions because they have been largely shown to represent predictors of poorer response. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The lack of selective, brain-penetrant and orally active V1a receptor antagonists has hampered the progress in our understanding of the precise/complete pharmacological role of V1a-R in central nervous system disorders and the development of novel treatments for these disorders. The optimization of promising V1a-R antagonist lead compounds and testing in known and relevant in vivo animal models will be a significant step forward in our understanding of the role of V1a-R in CNS disorders and in the development of novel treatments of anxiety, depression and PTSD. The lack of published data regarding brain-penetration and off-target selectivity, along with intellectual property barriers of the known V1a-R antagonists precludes their potential usefulness as CNS agents. As a result, there is a substantial need to discover centrally active V1a-R antagonists that are useful as in vivo tools to better understand the pharmacological role of V1a-R in CNS disorders with the potential as clinically therapeutic agents. The Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (SRIMSC), part of the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network (MLPCN), reports ML389 as a highly potent V1a-R antagonist with an IC50 of 40 nM, and high selectivity (selectivities vs. vasopressin 1b receptor, vasopressin 2 receptor, and the oxytocin receptor of >1250 fold). ML389 was identified by medicinal chemistry optimization of lead compounds. A set of pharmacokinetic analyses show that ML389 has good brain penetration, no significant activity at four human cytochrome P450 subtypes, high binding for human and rodent plasma protein, and an encouraging in vivo pharmacokinetic profile in mice. Broad selectivity screening data against a panel of receptors, transporters, and ion channels suggest that ML389 is generally inactive against a broad array of off targets and does not likely exert unwanted effects. ML389 serves as a novel V1a-R antagonist that can be developed as a therapeutic for the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression and PTSD.",,,,"['Mittapalli, Gopi', 'Argaryan, Lusine', 'Brown, Steven J', 'Saldanha, S Adrian', 'Volmar, Claude-Henry', 'Ferguson, Jill', 'Roberts, Edward', 'Hodder, Peter', 'Rosen, Hugh', 'Book Chapter', 'NBK259185 [bookaccession]']",,Probe Reports from the NIH Molecular Libraries Program,,,Bethesda (MD),,,,25506967.0,eng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, war, political oppression, epidemics, and economic recessions happen to whole communities and, sometimes, whole societies. This is not to say that all exposed individuals experience the event identically; in a disaster, one person may lose a loved one, while another loses a home, and another only a few possessions. Nor is this to say that all exposed individuals respond identically; a person’s psychological, social, and material resources powerfully shape his or her capacity to cope and function effectively. When stress pervades the community, however, these factors tell only part of the story. To have an ecologically valid understanding of mass trauma, we must recognize that survivors are connected and dependent upon one another’s coping strategies. Their attributions and actions reflect a host of social influences, social comparisons, and emergent norms. They help each other but also compete for scarce resources. Household preparedness is vital, but one household can no more prepare for disaster than it could, on its own, protect itself from crime or disease, educate its children, or keep the roads safe. Consequently, an individual’s resilience is inextricably linked to the community’s ability to prepare for, respond to, and adapt to adverse conditions. Simply put, when problems are shared, so must be solutions. In recognition of such interdependencies, “community resilience” has emerged as a key concept for disaster readiness, although by no means limited to this one goal (Norris et al., 2008). This chapter will explore the concept of community resilience in some depth. Broadly, the chapter is organized into four sections. The first section provides our perspective on the meaning of resilience, including definitions that work across levels of analysis (individual, family, organization, community, society). The second section describes the adaptive capacities theorized to yield community resilience. This is followed by an outline of measurement strategies and challenges in assessing capacities, including some of our own pilot work. The concluding section makes recommendations for intervention and raises issues that need to be addressed in future research. © Cambridge University Press 2011.","Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD, National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, Dartmouth Medical School, White River Junction, VT, United States National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, National Child Traumatic Stress Network of the Terrorism and Disaster Center, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States",Scopus,,"['Cited By :7', 'Export Date: 10 March 2016']",162-175,Resilience and Mental Health: Challenges Across the Lifespan,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84923765511&partnerID=40&md5=b1571da1dca50c3f3784e405ca01c393,10.1017/CBO9780511994791.013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

(1991) found that a lifetime prevalence of serious injury or serious motor vehicle crash was 41.9%, rating second in frequency of traumatic events. The conditional risk for developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) following serious accidents and injury is relatively low (Kessler et al., 1995); that is, the risk of developing PTSD in all those who are exposed to traumatic injury is low relative to other traumatic events such as interpersonal violence (Breslau et al., 1998). Nevertheless, serious injury is a leading cause of PTSD because of the frequency with which injury occurs. For example, Breslau et al. (1998) found that serious injury accounted for nearly one-quarter of the PTSD cases in their community sample. This was also the case in both the National Comorbidity Survey (Kessler et al., 1995) and the equivalent Australian study (Creamer et al., 2001). Taken together, although the conditional risk of developing PTSD following serious injury is low, the substantial frequency with which injury occurs makes injury one of the most frequent causes of PTSD. This chapter aims to orient both practitioner and researcher to the current status of research regarding PTSD following injury. However, when evaluating this literature and when conducting assessments with injury survivors, researchers and practitioners alike must be cognizant of a number of key issues that may impact on the diagnosis of PTSD. These factors include the following: differentiating among the physical, psychological, and environmental origin of symptoms; head injury and how it complicates assessment; the impact of secondary stressors; the influence of medications on symptom presentation; and the role of litigation. Appropriate attention to these factors will help to optimize the reliability and consistency of mental health assessments following injury.","University of Melbourne, West Heidelberg, VIC 3081, Australia University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia University Hospital, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland Hadassah University Hospital, Kiriat Hadassah, Jerusalem 91120, Israel",Scopus,,"['Cited By :11', 'Export Date: 10 March 2016']",70-84,"Psychological Knowledge in Court: PTSD, Pain, and TBI",http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-67549101252&partnerID=40&md5=9fd90927b098243477fdb0c0eb3a073e,10.1007/0-387-25610-5_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1). © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Department of Psychiatry, Boston University, School of Medicine, Dowling 7 850 Harrison Avenue, Boston, MA 02118, United States",Scopus,,['Export Date: 14 January 2015'],275-307,Pharmacotherapy of Depression: Second Edition,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84892784660&partnerID=40&md5=a796df6c2e6719dab331d3461557d8f7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

This criterion has influenced the thinking about causes of the disorder, approaches to treatment, and also how to establish an effective animal model of the disorder. Accordingly, the focus in animal models of PTSD is on what would establish an effective traumatic exposure that would lead to PTSD-related symptoms in the studied animal. However, the prevalence of PTSD among individuals exposed to a traumatic event suggests that the exposure to the trauma is not sufficient to induce PTSD, since most exposed individuals will not develop the disorder. The emphasis in translational animal models of PTSD should thus be on inclusion of relevant risk factors, that together with the exposure to a traumatic event will lead to the development of PTSD. Epidemiological studies indicate that childhood trauma predisposes individuals to develop stress-related disorders later in life. As a result of this finding, we developed an animal model in which exposing rats to early adolescence (postweaning, prepubertal, juvenile) stress was also found to induce a predisposition to develop PTSD following an exposure to an additional stress in adulthood. Within these pre-exposed animals, dissociation could be caused among individuals that exhibited more anxious or more depressive symptoms. This dissociation, which has been recognized also in human patients, required the development of a behavioral profiling approach that enabled grouping animals according to their clusters of symptoms. Interestingly, this approach also enabled the identification of new data on the influence of sex on long-term consequences of “Juvenile Stress.” These data reveal that whilst both male and female rats showed behavioral changes following exposure to a stressor at juvenility, the profile of effects differed between the sexes. Collectively, these findings indicate that the model presented here is an effective translational model for understanding of the etiology of trauma-related disorders and of relevant predisposing factors. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.","Department of Psychology, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel The “Sagol” Department of Neurobiology, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel The Institute for the Study of Affective Neuroscience (ISAN), University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel Department of Veterinary Resources, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel",Scopus,,['Export Date: 10 February 2016'],65-77,"Future Directions in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment",http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84944080492&partnerID=40&md5=a2523b9d62774ee5c46284509f533653,10.1007/978-1-4899-7522-5_3,,,"['Animal model', 'Behavioral profiling', 'Peri-adolescent stress', 'Risk factors', 'Sex differences']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

A substantial number of these patients suffer from the consequences of severe and prolonged interpersonal trauma usually referred to as “Complex PTSD”. Another common consequence of repeated interpersonal trauma in childhood are dissociative symptoms that may or may not co-occur with PTSD in SUD patients. While several hypotheses can explain the relationships between SUD and PTSD, the self-medication hypothesis has the strongest empirical support. Patients with both disorder have a more severe clinical profile than SUD patients without PTSD, poorer adherence to treatment, a shorter duration of abstinence, and worse outcomes across a variety of measures. Their clinical needs often make a treatment approach necessary that integrates SUD specific and trauma specific interventions. Several trauma treatments focusing on the present (i.e. providing skills training and psycho-education) and, more recently, also past-focused (i.e. exposure-based) treatments have been evaluated in SUD patients with co-occurring PTSD.

Sociological approaches to social conflicts and their resolution and social capital approaches are able to capture these universal features of post-disaster contexts. However, socioculturally distinctive features, specific imbalances of power, and diverging personal and shared ways of dealing with disasters and related aid probably contribute to a locally specific way of coping with disaster aid goods and associated social conflicts. For instance, does the social standard for maintaining harmony (rukun) counter the development of social bitterness? In what way may it hinder resolutions of social conflicts? This chapter explores contributing elements of conflict dynamics and subsequently demonstrates the variety of ways of coping with conflicts. Identified coping styles ranged on a continuum with confrontational, clarifying, and direct (assimilative) strategies on one pole, subversive strategies in the middle, and indirect, accommodative, accepting strategies on the other pole. Several situational elements, such as sense of entitlement, social standing within the community as well as timing issues, that is, the probability of whether justice may still be achieved or not in the short or long term, seemed to moderate which strategy is enacted. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Research uses quantitative methods to build knowledge about the mechanisms and conditions by which disasters affect mental health. The focus of analysis is on measures of individual differences with regard to experiences, coping strategies, and mental health outcomes. Developing generalizable and, potentially, universally applicable models is a major research interest. We argue that methodologies used in mainstream psychologies are not compatible with the purposes of our approach-that is, to describe sociocultural-specific personal and communal long-term coping dynamics after a disaster. We argue that a cultural-psychological approach implies specific propositions about human subjectivity, human agency, and research methods. Previously prominent, restrictive epistemological approaches to coping with disasters need to be broadened by rethinking research units, allowing for complex interrelations instead of assuming a linear causal process, being process-oriented, and including power-critical investigations.

According to national statistics on the prevalence of childhood abuse and neglect in the United States, 905,000 people under 18 years of age were victimized during 2006. Of these, 64.1% were neglected; 16.0% were physically abused; and 15.1% suffered abandonment, threats of harm, congenital drug addiction, or other forms of maltreatment. Furthermore, 8.8% were sexually abused; 6.6% were either emotionally or psychologically maltreated; and 2.2% were medically neglected. Childhood maltreatment is a major risk factor for the development of depression, drug and alcohol abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder (BPD), personality disorders, and aggression. Depending on an individual's sex, genetic makeup, and age at insult, chronic childhood traumatic stress (CTS) alters the endocrine profile and gene-expression pattern, as well as the functional activity, hemispheric integration, and morphology of the brain. In this chapter, we offer a holistic portrayal of the pathways between maltreatment and adverse psychiatric outcomes, arguing that the impact of abuse and neglect is best understood in the context of normal ontogenetic processes relating to trajectories of brain development.

Each year over 3 million children are reported for abuse and/or neglect in the United States (Wang & Daro, 1997). The effects of abuse and neglect are well documented to persist over time. Although posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has received much attention in the research and clinical literature, it is not the most common psychiatric diagnosis in children with histories of abuse and neglect (Putnam, 2003).Separation anxiety disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and phobic disorders may all be more frequent diagnoses than PTSD in abused children, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common as well (Ackerman, Newton, McPherson, Jones, & Dykman, 1998). Because there is only one trauma-related diagnosis in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV), the effects of trauma on children are generally described under the rubric of PTSD, with numerous additional comorbid diagnoses to describe the many other psychological and biological functions that are disturbed by life experiences that may overwhelm the coping mechanisms of the growing human organism. When the DSM-IV was under development, extensive research was conducted to support the introduction of complex PTSD or disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specificed (DESNOS) as an extended diagnosis for children and adults who were victims of prolonged interpersonal abuse (Herman, 1992; van der Kolk, Roth, Pelcovitz, Sunday, & Spinazzola, 2005). © Cambridge University Press 2007.","University of New SouthWales, Australia",Scopus,,"['Cited By :6', 'Export Date: 10 February 2016']",242-258,"Understanding Trauma: Integrating Biological, Clinical, and Cultural Perspectives",http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-70350446455&partnerID=40&md5=1b7c7be4b93692ef79e7954f5877b625,10.1017/CBO9780511500008.015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
CHAP,"Soriano, M. F., Bajo, T.",,,2011.0,Hallucinations and intrusive thoughts,Hallucinations and intrusive thoughts,1001,"Hallucinations have traditionally been conceptualized as a perceptual disorder. However, several lines of research have recently highlighted the similarity between hallucinations and intrusive thoughts. For example, Morrison and Baker (2000) have shown that patients who experience hallucinations also have more intrusive thoughts than patients who do not hallucinate. Similarly, Moritz and Laroi (2008) examined the cognitive and sensory characteristics of thoughts, intrusions and hallucinations, and they did not find a specific profile for hallucinations, compared to intrusions and normal thoughts. From this view, perceptual abnormalities would not be central to the experience of hearing voices, but an interpretation of cognitive intrusions. Recently, we have found (Soriano, Román, Jiménez & Bajo, 2009) that schizophrenic patients with hallucinations showed impairments in intentional inhibition in memory, compared to schizophrenics without hallucinations, and healthy controls. We have hypothesized that both hallucinations and intrusive thoughts could be partly due to difficulties to inhibit mental events, so that unwanted or repetitive thoughts or images intrude into consciousness. Consistent with this idea, Verwoerd, Wessel and de Jong (2009) have found a relationship between individual differences in inhibitory control and the frequency of experiencing intrusive memories. Interestingly, intrusive thoughts and images were only related to cognitive inhibition (measured as resistance to proactive interference), but not to response inhibition. Therefore, we suggest that inhibitory difficulties may underlie the frequency of intrusions, whereas the interpretation of these intrusions might lead to the experience of them as voices, intrusions-obsessions, or normal thoughts. As Morrison (2001) has proposed, in hallucinating patients, metacognitive beliefs would induce the erroneous attribution of intrusions to external sources, producing the hallucinatory experience. This view has important consequences in the conceptualization of mental disorders. Hallucinations have been considered a cardinal symptom in schizophrenia, while intrusions are a common symptom of various mental disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder.

However, anxiety also exists in pathological forms, and anxiety disorders are the most prevalent of psychiatric disorders. Prevalence rates vary with the diagnostic tools used to estimate them, and with study design, but the most extensive studies suggest that within the United States, 15.7 million people are affected yearly and 30 million at some point in their lives (1). In a US study, 6% of men and 13% of women had suffered from an anxiety disorder in the previous 6 mo (2). According to current classi-cation in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) (3) major anxiety disorders include phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety. Although the speci-c symptomatology and etiology of these disorders varies, as does the recommended psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment, all of these disorders are characterized by at least three core clusters of symptoms: autonomic arousal, avoidance, and cognitive disturbance. Arousal of the autonomic nervous system involves sympathetic activation with associated tachycardia, sweating, shortness of breath, dry mouth, and other concomitants of preparation for a ""-ght-or-ight"" response to a real or perceived threat. Avoidance involves physical or psychological distancing from threatening environments or events. Anxietyrelated cognitive disturbance focuses on thoughts and feelings about the perceived threat and includes such symptoms as intrusive thoughts (as in OCD and PTSD), dif-culty concentrating, vigilance, and excessive worry. Although there are similarities in core symptomatology across anxiety disorders, and with normal anxiety, there are also differences in the symptoms of each individual disorder. Accompanying the core symptoms of arousal, avoidance, and cognitive disturbance present in generalized anxiety and fear are alterations in the neurochemical environment within the brain, and many workers in the eld would argue that what distinguishes ""normal"" anxiety from the anxiety disorders is that the latter reect a neurobiological disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). © 2005 Humana Press.","Department of Psychology, University of Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom",Scopus,,['Export Date: 14 January 2015'],267-289,Dopamine and Glutamate in Psychiatric Disorders,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84891417560&partnerID=40&md5=1f400bd06fd61dd72c8b577c3cf33368,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

([Winnie the Pooh] Milne, 2004; p. 99) Introduction Adjusting to a significant life event can be difficult for children and adults alike. A sudden bereavement, or bearing witness to violence or a tragic accident are experiences likely to be accompanied by complex, even debilitating feelings of fear or sadness. For the young child, making sense of traumatic events is complicated by limited life experiences, naïve understandings of the world and reliance on those around them. Their interpretation of events may be hindered by child-like language and reasoning. This chapter seeks to describe the impact of such events on children and portray the application of a model that can be used both to understand such reactions and guide interventions intended to help children by enabling them to confront their experiences, formulate a narrative and develop a helpful meaning of the event. Diagnosis Traumatic events can lead to a variety of psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, behavioural problems, substance abuse, self-harm and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Perrin et al., 2000). In clinical practice, children’s reactions to traumatic events may be complex; those with symptoms of PTSD, who fail to meet the strict criteria for a diagnosis according to the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–IV–TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), may still be suffering from substantial distress and impairment (Carrion et al., 2002), which may respond to intervention.

J.",,,2009.0,Substance use and misuse after disaster prevalences and correlates,Substance use and misuse after disaster prevalences and correlates,13010,"Introduction Exposure to various traumatic events, as well as resulting disturbances such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is associated with increased substance use (Breslau, Davis, & Schultz, 2003; Feldner, Babson, & Zvolensky, 2007; McFarlane, 1998; Morissette, Tull, Gulliver, Kamholz, & Zimering, 2007; Stewart, 1996). In particular, studies have shown that alcohol and tobacco consumption increase through both initiation of and increasing use of these substances. It is, however, unclear whether this is also true in the aftermath of large-scale catastrophes or disasters. The distinction between individual traumatic experiences and collective experiences (e.g., disasters) may be sometimes unclear (Galea, Nandi, & Vlahov, 2005). Moreover, comorbidity profiles of PTSD and substance use and misuse, as well as the population under study, may differ between types of trauma (Deering, Glover, Ready, Eddleman, & Alarcon, 1996). Insight into substance use and misuse after disaster is important for several reasons. First, similar to PTSD and other mental health disturbances, understanding the prevalence of substance use and misuse after disasters is necessary in estimating the need for mental health services (see Cao, McFarlane, & Klimidis, 2003) and in organizing programs to prevent prolonged and increased use to minimize adverse affects on health and functioning. Second, information on comorbidity (e.g., PTSD, depression), correlates, and predictors of substance use may help to identify victims who are at risk for substance disorders and increased substance use in the short, medium and/or long term. © Cambridge University Press 2009.","Institute for Psychotrauma (IvP), Diemen, Netherlands Department of Clinical and Health Psychology, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands",Scopus,,"['Cited By :5', 'Export Date: 10 February 2016']",94-115,Mental Health and Disasters,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84927045570&partnerID=40&md5=06a2c26762e117bd21b8ba59d7512bd7,10.1017/CBO9780511730030.006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Third, we review the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for various disorders associated with trauma exposure. Fourth, we review the best available instruments designed to assess these disorders. Fifth, we review the current best practices for treatment of these conditions including psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, and combined approaches designed to treat comorbid conditions.

Much of the research deals with specific types of victimization (e.g., domestic violence, rape), empirical aspects of victimization in general (e.g., victimization surveys) and the consequences of victimization (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)). However, despite the many empirical studies, relatively little attention has been paid to theoretical aspects of victimology. As Landau and Freeman-Longo point out, the dearth of theoretical work in victimology is surprising given that in a relatively new field problems of definition and boundary-setting would be an important starting point for further studies therein. Victimologists have not always shied away from theoretical work. Early victimologists, such as Hans von Hentig, Benjamin Mendelsohn, Marvin Wolfgang and Ezzat Fattah, were very active in developing theoretical victimology. Each developed their own typology of victims in order to better understand, explain and hence prevent victimization. By the early 1980s, under the influence of the victims’ movement, these typologies lost much of their original popularity, as victimology moved away from criminology and stopped trying to explain crime. As Ezzat Fattah observes, there was a shift ‘from victimology of the act to victimology of action’ as victimology became increasingly associated with victim support. © Cambridge University Press 2014.","University of Montreal, Canada",Scopus,,['Export Date: 10 February 2016'],316-337,Criminological Approaches to International Criminal Law,http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84953731483&partnerID=40&md5=abae6c3728cc8cac256902965d5e5881,10.1007/CBO9781107446700.014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Data were compared for two veteran groups: one group treated previously for ptsd (n = 57) and a second group of untreated veterans undergoing initial ptsd assessment (n = 51). Interview data, and responses to the Detailed Assessment of ptsd Scale (daps) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (pai) were submitted to formal statistical analysis. The results indicated that a history of developmental abuse, cluster B personality traits, and adolescent and military substance abuse were associated with ptsd relapse among veterans treated previously within exposure-based, cognitive-behavioural therapy (cbt-pe). The implications of veteran accounts of unreported physical and sexual abuse, and ongoing use of substances during prior treatment (i.e., cbt-pe) are discussed. The findings support recommendations that clinicians conduct developmentally-focused assessments for personnel presenting with military-related trauma. Results also provide support for a formal study aimed at validating screening protocols to identify clients at risk for relapse after treatment, and to tailor treatment regimes with particular assessment profiles.

In this chapter we discuss the notion that these psychosocial risk factors, particularly if they are present at young age, may set a trajectory of increased IHD risk in women, even though clinical events may occur years later. Emerging data suggest that young women are uniquely susceptible to the adverse cardiovascular effects psychosocial stress, which can result in earlier onset of IHD or more adverse prognosis if the disease is already manifest. Women’s vulnerability to psychosocial stress could also play a role in sex differences in the pathophysiology of IHD; for example it could help explain their higher propensity to abnormal coronary vasomotion and micro-vascular disease, which has been described in women compared with men. Young women are severely under-represented in studies of cardiovascular disease. In future research, it will be crucial to study women earlier in their life to better understand the risk pathways linking psychosocial stress to IHD risk, in order to devise successful preventive and treatment strategies to ameliorate such risk. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Department of Epidemiology, Emory University Rollins, School of Public Health, Atlanta, MI, United States",Scopus,,['Export Date: 10 February 2016'],63-86,"Psychosocial Stress and Cardiovascular Disease in Women: Concepts, Findings, Future Perspectives",http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84943643246&partnerID=40&md5=596482496d0fdd4ad827e8737c484a98,10.1007/978-3-319-09241-6_6,,,"['Depression', 'Gender factors', 'Ischemic heart disease (ihd)', 'Post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd)', 'Psychosocial stress', 'Sex', 'Women’s health']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
