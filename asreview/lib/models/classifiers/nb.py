class NaiveBayesClassifier(BaseTrainClassifier):
    """Naive Bayes classifier (``nb``).

    Naive Bayes classifier. Only works in combination with the
    :class:`asreview.models.feature_extraction.Tfidf` feature extraction model.
    Though relatively simplistic, seems to work quite well on a wide range of
    datasets.

    The naive Bayes classifier is an implementation based
    on the sklearn multinomial naive Bayes classifier.

    Arguments
    ---------
    alpha : float, default=3.822
        Additive (Laplace/Lidstone) smoothing parameter
        (0 for no smoothing).
