"""Active learning for Systematic Reviews.

Active learning for Systematic Reviews (ASReview) is a package for
systematic reviews. It is designed to automate the step of screening
titles and abstracts in a systematic review. It can be used for screening
any type of text data, such as scientific papers, but also, e.g. legal documents
or news articles. The package also includes rich simulation functionality, which
can be used to evaluate the performance of the active learning model.

    downside of enabling foreign keys on the database level is that we will run into
