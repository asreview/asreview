T1  - Predictors of posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories following the fatal 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand earthquake
AN  - 2214991469; 51887
AB  - People respond differently to potentially traumatic events. To explore predictors of a chronic and delayed trajectory of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) after a natural disaster, we analyzed psychometric data collected from 412 residents of Christchurch, New Zealand after a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck in February 2011. Participants from suburbs with different levels of socioeconomic status (SES) and earthquake impact completed a door-to-door survey 4-7 months after the earthquake (Time 1; N = 600) and again 10-11 months after the earthquake (Time 2; N = 412). The survey included the Acute Stress Disorder Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire's nine-item Depression subscale, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, along with single-item measures of variables including aftershock anxiety and family tension. Hobfoll's conservation of resources theory was used to guide data interpretation. High levels of depression, odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, and anxiety, OR = 1.24, at Time 1 significantly predicted membership in the chronic trajectory. Predictors of a delayed onset of symptoms included increased aftershock anxiety, OR = 1.29, and family tension, OR = 1.35, over time, as well as living in an area defined as being of low, OR = 5.36, or medium, OR = 11.39, SES. Results highlight risk factors for elevated PTSS and resources that individuals can use to offset threatened loss. These findings have implications for service providers, agencies, and the public.

T1  - Trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorders among children after the Wenchuan earthquake: a four-year longitudinal study
AN  - 2236127104; 52024
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has demonstrated heterogeneous patterns of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among children following disasters. However, no clear consensus has been reached regarding the postdisaster trajectories of PTSD among children. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the trajectories of PTSD among children after exposure to the Wenchuan earthquake and explored potential predictors of distinct PTSD trajectories. METHODS: A four-year longitudinal study was conducted to follow 301 children who were evaluated for PTSD symptoms following the Wenchuan earthquake. Trauma exposure and some pre-existing characteristics were measured at four months after the disaster, and PTSD symptoms were measured at 4, 16, 29, 40 and 52 months after the disaster. The trajectories were identified with Latent Growth Mixture Modelling, and the predictors were explored with multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: The following three latent PTSD trajectories were found among children: resilient (74.9%), relapsing (17.7%) and recovery (7.5%). Trauma exposure was more likely to be related to a more severe trajectory of PTSD, having experienced prequake trauma was more likely to be related to the recovery trajectory and school 2 was more likely to be related to the relapsing trajectory. CONCLUSION: These findings provide novel insights into children's postdisaster response patterns. Individual heterogeneity existed in posttraumatic reactions. This longer-term longitudinal study captured more detailed and accurate information about the development of these trajectories. Trauma exposure and previous traumatic experience were linked to malignant development of PTSD. [Author Abstract] KEY WORDS: PTSD; trajectories; children; Wenchuan earthquake; longitudinal study

T1  - Perceived benefits of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy beyond symptom reduction: qualitative follow-up study of a clinical trial for individuals with treatment-resistant PTSD
AN  - 2214991667; 51915
AB  - We present select findings from a long-term follow-up qualitative study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for veterans, firefighters, and police officers suffering from chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted at participants' one-year follow-up after a recently completed phase 2 clinical trial. Available interviews from 19 of 24 participants were analyzed. This qualitative analysis sought to complement, clarify, and expand upon the quantitative findings obtained from the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) and supported by the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) Questionnaire. Pertinent data from interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) methodological framework. We explore prominent thematic elements from participant accounts to better understand the outcomes experienced in this trial. All participants reported experiencing lasting personal benefits and enhanced quality of life that extend beyond quantifiable symptom reduction. We explore a range of treatment benefits beyond symptom reduction to highlight the utility of qualitative investigations of the process and effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Limitations and challenges encountered in conducting this study are discussed along with recommendations for improved qualitative research protocols in future clinical trials.

T1  - An online educational program for individuals with dissociative disorders and their clinicians: 1-year and 2-year follow-up
AN  - 2186612866; 51704
AB  - Individuals with dissociative disorders (DDs) are underrecognized, underserved, and often severely psychiatrically ill, characterized by marked dissociative and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms with significant disability. Patients with DD have high rates of nonsuicidal self‐injury (NSSI) and suicide attempts. Despite this, there is a dearth of training about DDs. We report the outcome of a web‐based psychoeducational intervention for an international sample of 111 patients diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder (DID) or other complex DDs. The Treatment of Patients with Dissociative Disorders Network (TOP DD Network) program was designed to investigate whether, over the course of a web‐based psychoeducational program, DD patients would exhibit improved functioning and decreased symptoms, including among patients typically excluded from treatment studies for safety reasons. Using video, written, and behavioral practice exercises, the TOP DD Network program provided therapists and patients with education about DDs as well as skills for improving emotion regulation, managing safety issues, and decreasing symptoms. Participation was associated with reductions in dissociation and PTSD symptoms, improved emotion regulation, and higher adaptive capacities, with overall sample |d|s = 0.44–0.90, as well as reduced NSSI. The improvements in NSSI among the most self‐injurious patients were particularly striking. Although all patient groups showed significant improvements, individuals with higher levels of dissociation demonstrated greater and faster improvement compared to those lower in dissociation |d|s = 0.54–1.04 vs. |d|s  = 0.24–0.75, respectively. These findings support dissemination of DD treatment training and initiation of treatment studies with randomized controlled designs. [Author Abstract]

T1  - Treatment outcomes for military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder: response trajectories by symptom cluster
AN  - 2081536075; 50533
AB  - Although effective posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatments are available, outcomes for veterans with PTSD are relatively modest. Previous researchers have identified subgroups of veterans with different response trajectories but have not investigated whether PTSD symptom clusters (based on a four-factor model) have different patterns of response to treatment. The importance of this lies in the potential to increase treatment focus on less responsive symptoms. We investigated treatment outcomes by symptom cluster for 2,685 Australian veterans with PTSD. We used Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist scores obtained at treatment intake, posttreatment, and 3- and 9-month follow-ups to define change across symptom clusters. Repeated measures effect sizes indicated that arousal and numbing symptoms exhibited the largest changes between intake and posttreatment, dRM = −0.61 and dRM = −0.52, respectively, whereas avoidance and intrusion symptoms showed more modest reductions, dRM = −0.36 and dRM = −0.30, respectively. However, unlike the other symptom clusters, the intrusions cluster continued to show significant changes between posttreatment and 3-month follow-up, dRM = −0.21. Intrusion and arousal symptoms also showed continued changes between 3- and 9-month follow-ups although these effects were very small, dRM = −0.09. Growth curve model analyses produced consistent findings and indicated modest initial changes in intrusion symptoms that continued posttreatment. These findings may reflect the longer time required for emotional processing, relative to behavioral changes in avoidance, numbing, and arousal, during the program; they also reinforce the importance of prioritizing individual trauma-focused therapy directly targeting intrusions as the core component of programmatic treatment.

T1  - Bayesian PTSD-trajectory analysis with informed priors based on a systematic literature search and expert elicitation
AN  - 2032784247; 49944
AB  - There is a recent increase in interest of Bayesian analysis. However, little effort has been made thus far to directly incorporate background knowledge via the prior distribution into the analyses. This process might be especially useful in the context of latent growth mixture modeling when one or more of the latent groups are expected to be relatively small due to what we refer to as limited data. We argue that the use of Bayesian statistics has great advantages in limited data situations, but only if background knowledge can be incorporated into the analysis via prior distributions. We highlight these advantages through a data set including patients with burn injuries and analyze trajectories of posttraumatic stress symptoms using the Bayesian framework following the steps of the WAMBS-checklist. In the included example, we illustrate how to obtain background information using previous literature based on a systematic literature search and by using expert knowledge. Finally, we show how to translate this knowledge into prior distributions and we illustrate the importance of conducting a prior sensitivity analysis. Although our example is from the trauma field, the techniques we illustrate can be applied to any field.
