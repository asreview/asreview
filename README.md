# Automated Systematic Review

*This project is work in progress and **not** production ready.*

Systematic Reviews are “top of the bill” in research. The number of systematic
reviews published by researchers increases year after year. But performing a
sound systematic review is a time-consuming and sometimes boring task. Our
software is designed to take over the step of screening abstracts and titles
with a minimum of papers to be read by a human (in the training set and in the
final included set) and with zero false negatives (or any other small number). 

Dutch newspaper NRC on this project ["Software vist de beste artikelen uit een bibliotheek van duizenden."](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/01/14/software-vist-de-beste-artikelen-eruit-a3628952)
