  The Active learning for Systematic Reviews (ASReview)
  project implements learning algorithms that interactively
  query the researcher. This way of interactive training is
  known as Active Learning. ASReview offers support for
  classical learning algorithms and state-of-the-art
  learning algorithms like neural networks. ASReview LAB is
  the graphical user interface of the open-source research
  software and ships with an Oracle, Exploration, and
  Simulation Mode.
