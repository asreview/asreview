Covid-19
====================================
To help combat the Covid-19 crisis, the ASReview Core Development team has decided to release a package that provides the latest scientific datasets on Covid-19. These are integrated automatically into ASReview once we install the correct packages, so reviewers can start reviewing the latest scientific literature on Covid-19 as soon as possible!

Installing the ASReview Covid-19 package
-------------------------------- 

To install the Covid-19 package for ASReview, we assume you have installed the main ASReview software. If not, we refer to the :doc:`installation <installation>` page. Once ASReview has been installed, you can go to your terminal again and type "pip install asreview-covid19". This should install the Covid-19 package. We can now run the ASReview software again, by typing "asreview oracle" in the terminal. This should start the ASReview GUI. When we create a new project, the Covid-19 datasets should appear. When we select one of these, we can start reviewing the Covid-19 dataset!
