ASReview against COVID-19
=========================

The Active learning for Systematic Reviews software
`ASReview <https://github.com/asreview/asreview>`__ implements learning
algorithms that interactively query the researcher during the title and
abstract reading phase of a systematic search. This way of interactive
training is known as active learning. ASReview offers support for
classical learning algorithms and state-of-the-art learning algorithms
like neural networks. The software can be used for traditional
systematic reviews for which the user uploads a dataset of papers, or
one can make use of the built-in datasets.

To help combat the COVID-19 crisis, the ASReview team released an
extension that integrates the latest scientific datasets on COVID-19 in
the ASReview software.

CORD-19 dataset
---------------

The `CORD-19
dataset <https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research>`__ is a
dataset with scientific publications on COVID-19 and coronavirus-related
research (e.g. SARS, MERS, etc.) from PubMed Central, the WHO COVID-19
database of publications, the preprint servers bioRxiv and medRxiv and
papers contributed by specific publishers (currently Elsevier). The
dataset is compiled and maintained by a collaboration of the Allen
Institute for AI, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Georgetown
Universityâ€™s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Microsoft
Research, and the National Library of Medicine of the National
Institutes of Health. Version 5 of the dataset
(`csv <https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020-03-27/metadata.csv>`__,
dated March 27, 2020) contains metadata of 45.8K publications on
COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research. The CORD-19 dataset is
updated weekly.

ASReview plugin
---------------

To help combat the COVID-19 crisis, the ASReview team has decided to
release a package that provides the latest scientific datasets on
COVID-19. These are integrated automatically into ASReview once we
install the correct packages, so reviewers can start reviewing the
latest scientific literature on COVID-19 as soon as possible! Two
versions of the CORD-19 dataset (publications relating to COVID-19) are
made available in ASReview:

-  full CORD-19 dataset
-  CORD-19 dataset with publications from December 2019 onwards

The datasets are updated in ASReview plugin shortly after the release by
the Allen Institute for AI.

Installation and usage
----------------------

The COVID-19 plug-in requires ASReview 0.8 or higher. Install ASReview
by following the instructions in `Installation of
ASReview <https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`__.

Install the extension with pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install asreview-covid19

The datasets are immediately available after starting ASReview.

.. code:: bash

    asreview oracle

The datasets are selectable in Step 2 of the project initialization. For
more information on the usage of ASReview, please have a look at the
`Quick
Tour <https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quicktour.html>`__.
