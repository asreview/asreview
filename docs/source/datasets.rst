Datasets
========================
To perform an automated systematic review, ASReview requires a pool of papers that are selected for screening.
Such a pool can result from a systematic search. 

Every paper should carry metadata (e.g. title, abstract, author, etc) resulting in a dataset of papers.
For testing and demonstrating ASReview, the software offers `three built-in datasets <#built-in-demonstration-datasets>`__
It is also possible to perform an automated systematic review on `your own dataset <#using-your-own-data>`__.

Built-in demonstration datasets
---------------------
The three built-in datasets in 
Each dataset contains metadata on all papers obtained in the systematic search.
All papers who were included in the original study are indicated.

A dataset of 11,395 papers on posttraumatic stress disorder. Of these papers, 34 were included in the systematic review.

    "We performed a systematic search to identify longitudinal studies that applied LGMM, latent growth curve analysis, or hierarchical cluster analysis on symptoms of posttraumatic stress assessed after trauma exposure."

Using your own data
---------------------
To carry out an automated systematic review on your own dataset, your datafile needs to adhere to a certain format. 

ASReview accepts the following formats: 
.ris, .csv/(excel files)

Such a format can be obtained by exporting your papers from your reference manager . RefWorks, Mendeley, EndNote, ZoTero). 
This can be obtained by exporting your papers from your reference manager (refworks, mendeley, endnote, zotero)
