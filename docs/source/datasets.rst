For testing and demonstrating ASReview, the software offers three built-in, ready-to-use datasets.

Built-in demonstration datasets

from various research areas
Each dataset contains metadata on all papers obtained in the systematic search.
All papers who were included in the final review are indicated.

The datasets can be used demonstrate asreview.

Your own dataset can be used in Asreview
This can be obtained by exporting your papers from your reference manager (refworks, mendeley, endnote, zotero)

ASReview requires .ris, .csv/(excel files)
