Datasets
========

To perform an systematic review, ASReview LAB requires a dataset representing
all documents or publications obtained in a systematic search. To create such
a dataset for a systematic review, typically an online library search is
performed for all studies related to a particular topic.

Each entry in the dataset should hold metadata on a paper.  Mandatory metadata
are ``title`` and ``abstract``. Other metadata such as ``id``, ``author``,
``date``, and ``keywords`` are optional. When using ASReview in simulation
mode, an additional binary variable to indicate labeling decisions is
required, called ``included`` or ``label_included``.  All entries in the
dataset need to be screened, with the goal to select all relevant papers.

For testing and demonstrating ASReview, the software offers
`three built-in datasets <#built-in-demonstration-data-sets>`__
It is also possible to perform an automated systematic review on
`your own dataset <#using-your-own-data>`__.


Data format
-----------

To carry out an automated systematic review on your own dataset, your data file needs
to adhere to a certain format. ASReview accepts the following formats:

 - `Research Information Systems (RIS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format)>`_.
   Extension ``.ris``. RIS files are used by digital libraries, like IEEE Xplore, Scopus
   and ScienceDirect. Citation managers Mendeley, RefWorks, Zotero, and EndNote support
   the RIS format as well.
 - **Tabular datasets**. Extensions ``.csv``, ``.xlsx``, and ``.xls``. CSV files should
   be comma separated and UTF-8 encoded. For CSV files, the software accepts a set of
   predetermined labels in line with the ones used in RIS files.

Each entry in the dataset should hold metadata on a paper. Mandatory metadata
are title and abstract. Other metadata such as id, author, date, and keywords
are optional. When using ASReview in simulation mode, an additional binary
variable to indicate labeling decisions is required, called included or
label_included. All entries in the dataset need to be screened, with the goal
to select all relevant papers.

Search engines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using search engines, it is often possible to store the articles of
interest in a list or folder within the search engine itself. Thereafter, you
can choose from different ways to export the list/folder. When you have the
option to select parts of the citation to be exported, choose the option which
will provide the most information.

The export files of the following search engines have been tested for their
acceptance in ASReview:

+-----------------+---------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+

If the export of your search engine is not accepted in ASReview, you can also
try the following: import the search engine file first into one of the
citation managers mentioned in the previous part, and export it again into a
format that is accepted by ASReview.

Systematic review software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several software packages available for systematic reviewing. Some
of them use machine learning, while other focus on screening and management.
The overview below shows an overview of alternative software programs and the
compatibility with ASReview.

+-----------------+---------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+

- Supported: The data can be exported from the software and imported in ASReview using this extension.
- Not supported: The exported data can not be imported in ASReview using this extension.
- (empty): The data cannot be exported from the software using this extension.

\* When using Covidence it is possible to export articles in .ris formats for different citation managers,
such as Endnote, Mendeley, Refworks and Zotero. All of these are compatible with ASReview.

\** When exporting from Distiller set the ``sort references by`` to ``Authors``. Then the data can be
imported in ASReview.

\*** Robotreviewer does not provide exports suitable for asreview, since it supports evidence synthesis.

Demonstration datasets
----------------------

The ASReview software contains 3 datasets that can be used to test the
software and algorithms. The built-in datasets are PRISMA based reviews on
various research topics. Each paper in this systematic review is labeled relevant or
irrelevant. This information can be used to simulate the performance of ASReview.
The datasets are available in the front-end in step 2 and in the simulation mode.

Van de Schoot (PTSD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A dataset on 5782 papers on posttraumatic stress disorder. Of these papers, 38
were included in the systematic review.

    "We performed a systematic search to identify longitudinal studies that applied LGMM,
    latent growth curve analysis, or hierarchical cluster analysis on symptoms of
    posttraumatic stress assessed after trauma exposure."
