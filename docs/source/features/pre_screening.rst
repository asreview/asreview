Pre-Screening
=============

Before you can actually start screening you have to initialize a project,
select a dataset, prior knowledge and a model.


Start Setup
-----------

After you have started a project, you are redirected to the project dashboard
and you will first be asked to initialize the setup.

1. Open ASReview LAB.
2. Start a new project.
3. Click the *Start Setup* button.

Note: some of the features available in the project dashboard are
described in the :doc:`post_screening` section.

Select Dataset
--------------

To select a dataset:

1. Open ASReview LAB.
2. Start a new project.
3. Click the *Start Setup* button.
4. Choose one of the four options to select a dataset and click upload:

   :alt: ASReview dataset selector

.. warning::

    If you upload your own data, make sure to remove duplicates and to retrieve
    as many abstracts as possible (`don't know how?
    <https://asreview.nl/blog/the-importance-of-abstracts/>`_). With clean data you
    benefit most from what :doc:`active learning <../guides/activelearning>`
    has to offer.


From File
~~~~~~~~~

Upload your file by *Drag 'n' Drop*, or select your file via the browser.
The data needs to adhere to a :doc:`specific format<../intro/datasets>`. If a
file is uploaded and recognized as one of the available formats, it will
display the message *Successful upload* and state the number of records in
the dataset.

From URL
~~~~~~~~

Fill in a link to a file on the Internet. For example, a link from this
`dataset repository <https://github.com/asreview/systematic-review-datasets>`__.

From Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select a file available via an extension like the :doc:`COVID-19 extension <../extensions/extension_covid19>`.

Benchmark Datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select one of the :ref:`benchmark datasets <benchmark-datasets>`.

.. _partly-labeled-data:

Partly Labeled Data
-------------------

If you want to include decisions you've already made prior to setting up your
project, you can upload a partly labeled dataset containg labels for part of
the data and unlabeled records you want to screen with ASReview. This might be
helpful if you switch from screening in another tool to screening with
ASReview, or when updating an existing systematic review with more recent
publications.

Currently, this can be done by merging your dataset with labeled and unlabeled
records via Excel or another reference manager. Your dataset should contain a
column, called *label_included* (or: final_included, label, label_included,
included_label, included_final, included, included_flag, include) which is
filled with 1's or 0's for the publications that you have already screened,
and is empty for the records that you still need to screen using
ASReview.

To use a partly labeled dataset:

1. Open ASReview LAB.
2. Start a new project.
3. Click the *Start Setup* button.
4. Select your partly labeled dataset.

ASReview will recognize the column with the labels and show you the number of
prior relevant/irrelevant papers in the section *Prior Knowledge*.

.. _select-prior-knowledge:

Select Prior Knowledge
----------------------

The first iteration of the :doc:`active learning cycle
<../guides/activelearning>` requires prior knowledge to work. This knowledge
is used to train the first model. In this step you need to provide at least
one relevant and one irrelevant document. To facilitate this, it is possible
to search within your dataset (for finding prior relevant papers) or ask the
software to present a couple of random documents (for prior irrelevant
papers).

1. Open ASReview LAB.
2. Start a new project.
3. Click the *Start Setup* button.
4. Select a dataset.
5. Click **Search** or **Random** to select your prior knowledge.

After selecting some prior information, you can click **Next**.

Search
~~~~~~

Let's start with finding a prior relevant document. The most efficient way
to do this is by searching for a specific document which you already know is
relevant. Click the search button and search your dataset by authors,
keywords or title, or a combination thereof. Make sure to be precise
with the search terms, as only the first 10 results are shown to you.
After entering your search terms, press 'enter' to start searching.



.. figure:: ../../images/asreview_prescreening_prior_search.png
   :alt: ASReview prior knowledge search


Click the document you had in mind and click Relevant (Clicking Irrevant
results in an irrelevant document).

The Prior Knowledge step will now show 1 relevant document. This is already
enough to  proceed to the next step. Note that there are no restrictions on
the number of publications you need to provide, but preferably provide 1-5
relevant documents.

If you are done click **Next**.


Random
~~~~~~

You also need to provide at least one prior irrelevant document. One way to
find an irrelevant document is by labeling a set of random records from the
dataset. Given that the majority of documents in the dataset are irrelevant
(extremely imbalanced data problem), the documents presented here are likely
to be irrelevant for your study. Click on random to show a few random
documents. Indicate for each document whether it is relevant or irrelevant.

After labeling a couple of randomly selected documents, ASReview LAB will
ask you whether you want to stop. Click on **STOP** and click **Next**.


.. _select-model:

Select Model
------------

It is possible to change the settings of the Active learning model. There are
three ingredients that can be changed in the software: the type of classifier,
the query strategy and the feature extraction technique.

To change the default setting:

1. Open ASReview LAB.
2. Start a new project, upload a dataset and select prior knowledge.
3. Click on the **edit** icon (top right).
4. Using the drop-down menu select a different classifier, query strategy or feature extraction technique.
5. Click Finish.

   :alt: ASReview model


The classifier is the machine learning model used to compute the relevance
scores. The available classifiers are Naive Bayes, Support Vector
Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. More classifiers can be
selected via the :doc:`API <../API/reference>`. The default is Naive Bayes,
though relatively simplistic, it seems to work quite well on a wide range of
datasets.

The query strategy determines which document is shown after the model has
computed the relevance scores. The three options are: certainty-based, mixed and
random. When certainty-based is selected, the documents are shown in the order of
relevance score. The document most likely to be relevant is shown first. When
mixed is selected, the next document will be selected certainty-based 95% of the
time, and randomly chosen otherwise. When random is selected, documents are shown
in a random order (ignoring the model output completely). **Warning**: selecting
this option means your review is not going to be accelerated by using ASReview.

The feature extraction technique determines the method how text is translated
into a vector that can be used by the classifier. The default is TF-IDF (Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) from `SKLearn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html>`_.
It works well in combination with Naive Bayes and other fast training models.
Another option is Doc2Vec provided by the `gensim <https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/>`_
package which needs to be installed manually.
To use it, install the gensim package manually:

.. code:: bash

    pip install gensim

It takes relatively long to create a feature matrix with this method. However,
this only has to be done once per simulation/review. The upside of this method
is the dimension-reduction that generally takes place, which makes the
modelling quicker.
