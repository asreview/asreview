Post-Screening
==============

After you stop screening, or anytime you want to take a break, you can
return to the project dashboard by clicking the hamburger menu on the
top-left. Below we will explain the options in the project dashboard.


Download Results
----------------

A file containing all meta-data including your decisions can be downloaded
any time during the screening process. To download your results:

1. Open ASReview LAB.
2. Start a new project, upload a dataset and select prior knowledge.
3. Navigate to the Project Dashboard.
4. Click the *download* icon (see screenshot below), or click on *Download Results*.
5. You will be asked whether you want to save an excel or a csv file.
6. You will be asked where to save the file.

Three columns will be added to your dataset: 

The column titled **included** contains the labels as provided by the user:
``0`` = not relevant, ``1`` = relevant and if missing it means the record is
not seen during the screening process. First, all relevant records are
presented in the order these shown during the screening process. Then, all
records not seen during the screening proces are presented ordered from most
to least relevant according to the last iteration of the model. At end of the
file all non-relevant records are presented in the order these are shown
during the screening proces. 

The column titled **asreview_ranking** contains an identifier to
preserve the rank ordering as described above.  

If present, the column **record_id** contains the values of the original
**record_id** as included by the user. If not available, ASReview generates a
new record_id, based on the row number and starting at 0.
