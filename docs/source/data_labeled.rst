Fully and partially labeled data
================================

Fully and partially labeled datasets serve a special role in the ASReview
context. These datasets have review decisions for a subset of the records or
for all records in the dataset. 

.. tip::

  :ref:`data_labeled:Partially labeled data` is useful in the Oracle
  mode, whereas :ref:`data_labeled:Fully labeled data` is useful in the Simulation
  and Exploration mode.



Label format
------------


For tabular datasets (:doc:`e.g., CSV, XLSX <data_format>`), the dataset
should contain a column called "included" or "label" (See :ref:`Data format
<column-names>` for all naming conventions), which is filled with ``1``'s or
``0``'s for the records that are already screened, or selected by experts to
be used for prior knowledge. The value is left empty for the records that you
haven't screened yet, or which are added to the dataset.



For the RIS file format, the labels ``ASReview_relevant``,
``ASReview_irrelevant``, and ``ASReview_not_seen``) can be stored with the N1
(Notes) tag. An example of a RIS file with labels in the N1 tag can be found
in the `ASReview GitHub repository
<https://github.com/asreview/asreview/blob/master/tests/demo_data/baseline_tag-notes_labels.ris>`_.
All labels in this example are valid ways to label the data. 


.. note::

  Exported files containing labeling decisions can be imported into ASReview LAB again,
  and whereafter all labels are recognized.



Partially labeled data
----------------------

.. tip::

	Useful for Oracle projects. Read more about :ref:`project_create:Project modes`.

Partially labeled datasets are datasets with a labeling decision for a subset
of the records in the dataset and no decision for another subset.  

A partially labeled dataset can be obtained by exporting results from ASReview
LAB or other software. It can also be constructed given the format described
above by merging a labeled dataset with new unlabeled records.

Partially labeled datasets are useful as the labels will be recognized by
ASReview LAB as :ref:`Prior Knowledge <project_create:Select Prior Knowledge>`, and labels are used to
train the first iteration of the active learning model.

.. note::

  Merging labeled with unlabeled data should be done outside ASReview LAB, for
  example, with :ref:`data:Citation Managers`.


Fully labeled data
------------------

.. tip::

	Useful for Simulation and Exploration projects. Read more about :ref:`project_create:Project modes`.

Fully labeled datasets are datasets with a labeling decision for each record in
the dataset. Fully labeled datasets are useful for exploration or simulation
purposes (see also :ref:`simulation_overview:What is a simulation?` and
:ref:`project_create:Project modes`). 


Benchmark datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `ASReview research project <https://asreview.ai/about/>`_ collects fully
labeled datasets published open access. The labeled datasets are PRISMA-based
systematic reviews or meta-analyses on various research topics. They can be
useful for teaching purposes or for testing the performance of (new) active
learning models. The datasets and their metadata are available via the
`Systematic Review Datasets <https://github.com/asreview/systematic-review-datasets>`_ repository. In
ASReview LAB, these datasets are referred to as "Benchmark Datasets".

The Benchmark Datasets are directly available in the software. During the
:ref:`project_create:Add Dataset` step of the project setup, there is a panel
with all the datasets. The datasets can be selected and used directly.
Benchmark datasets are also available via the :doc:`simulation_cli`. Use the prefix
``benchmark:`` followed by the identifier of the dataset (see `Systematic
Review Datasets <https://github.com/asreview/systematic-review-datasets>`_
repository). For example, to use the Van de Schoot et al. (2017) dataset, use
``benchmark:van_de_schoot_2017``.

You can donate your dataset to the `Systematic Review Datasets <https://github.com/asreview/systematic-review-datasets>`_ collection by via a Pull Request, or send an email to asreview@uu.nl.
