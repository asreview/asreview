Troubleshooting
---------------

Unknown command "pip"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command line returns one of the following messages:

.. code:: bash

  -bash: pip: No such file or directory

.. code:: bash

  'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.


First, check if Python is installed with the following command:

.. code:: bash

    python --version

If this doesn't return 3.6 or higher, then Python isn't or not correctly
installed.

Most likely, the enviroment variables aren't configured correctly. Follow
our detailed step-by-step instructions to install Python correctly on
`Windows <https://asreview.nl/installation-guide-windows/>`__
and `MacOS <https://asreview.nl/installation-guide-mac/>`__.

However, there is a simple way to deal with correct environment variables
by ading `python -m` in front of the command. For example:

.. code:: bash

  python -m pip install asreview


Unknown command "asreview"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some situations, the entry point "asreview" can not be found after installation.
First check whether the package is correctly installed. Do this with the command
`python -m asreview -h`. If this shows a decription of the program, please use
`python -m` in front of all your commands. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m asreview oracle
