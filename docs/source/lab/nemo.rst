ASReview NEMO
=============

ASReview NEMO is an official extension of ASReview LAB that introduces advanced
models and components for systematic review screening. NEMO, which stands for
New Exciting MOdels, is a collection of state-of-the-art tools designed to handle
complex datasets and provide more accurate results. These models are optimized
for scalability and performance, making them ideal for researchers working with
large or multilingual datasets.

Installation
------------

Installing ASReview NEMO works like any other Python package. Simply install
it using the following command:

.. code:: bash

	pip install asreview-nemo

After installation, :ref:`lab/models:ELAS Heavy` and :ref:`lab/models:ELAS Multilingual` are available
for use.  Additionally, under the "Custom" option, you can mix and match various
feature extractors and classifiers to suit your needs.

.. tip::
  Since these models are generally more computationally intensive,
  it may take some time for the feature extractor and classifier to
  process your data.
