Import a Project
----------------

Another option is to import an ASReview project file (``.asreview``
extension). Usually, this is a project exported from ASReview LAB via the
:ref:`export-project` panel. Importing can be done by
clicking the red button in the bottom right corner of the home page. In the
pop-up screen choose the project file from your computer and click `Import`.
After a successful project initialization, a project dashboard will be shown.

Export Project
--------------

The ASReview project file (.asreview) can be exported from ASReview LAB.

users to replicate the project, or continue the systematic review.

To export your project:

1. Open ASReview LAB.
2. Start a new project, upload a dataset and select prior knowledge.
3. Navigate to the Project Dashboard.
4. Click on *Export this project*.
5. You will be asked where to save the ASReview file (extension `.asreview`).

----------------

To permanently delete a project, including ALL files:

1. Open ASReview LAB.
2. Start a new project, upload a dataset and select prior knowledge.
3. Navigate to the Project Dashboard.
4. Click on *Delete this project*.
