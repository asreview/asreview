Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

Enable keyboard shortcuts in the settings menu before you can make use of them. 

To improve the efficiency of the screening process, users can strike keyboard shortcuts to label the document as:

- ``R`` or ``r``: Relevant
- ``I`` or ``i``: Irrelevant

Users can undo a decision by striking ``U`` or ``u`` if the undo feature has been toggled on.
