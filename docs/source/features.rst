Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

To improve the efficiency of the screening process, users can strike keyboard shortcuts to label the document as:

- ``R`` or ``r``: Relevant
- ``I`` or ``i``: Irrelevant

Users can undo a decision by striking ``U`` or ``u`` if the undo feature has been toggled on.
