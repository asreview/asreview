Installation
============

Install ASReview
----------------

ASReview software requires having Python 3.6 or higher installed. Detailed
step-by-step instructions to install Python (and ASReview) are available for
`Windows <https://asreview.nl/installation-guide-windows/>`__ and
`MacOS <https://asreview.nl/installation-guide-macos/>`__ users.

Install the ASReview software with Pip by running the following command in the
`CMD.exe` (Windows) or `Terminal` (MacOS/Linux):

.. code:: bash

    pip install asreview

Start the application with the following command (in CMD.exe or Terminal):

.. code:: bash

    asreview lab

You are now ready to start your first Automated Systematic Review!

See `Troubleshooting`_ for common problems.



Upgrade ASReview
----------------

Upgrade ASReview software with

.. code:: bash

    pip install --upgrade asreview


Server Installation
-------------------

It is possible to run the ASReview software on a server or custom domain. Use
the flags `ip` and `port` for configuration. ASReview should only be used in
closed networks.

.. code:: bash

    asreview lab --port 5555 --ip xxx.x.x.xx

.. warning::

    Don't use the development server in production. Read the Flask documentation
    about `deploying a Flask app to production <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/deploy/>`__.


Install with Docker
-------------------

For a quickstart of ASReview LAB using Docker and without the need to
install anything else, the latest version of the ASReview LAB can be
started as well via Docker like this:

.. code:: bash

   docker run -p 5000:5000 asreview/asreview

This will start the ASReview LAB server on port 5000 with default
command line options and make it accessible to the host at
http://localhost:5000 More advanced command line options can be given
afterwards, like this:

.. code:: bash

   docker run -p 9000:9000 asreview/asreview  --port 9000

For more information, see `the GitHub page <https://github.com/asreview/asreview/tree/master/docker>`__.


Troubleshooting
---------------

ASReview LAB is advanced machine learning software. In some situations, you
might run into unexpected behavior. See below for solutions to
problems.

Unknown Command "pip"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command line returns one of the following messages:

.. code:: bash

  -bash: pip: No such file or directory

.. code:: bash

  'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.


First, check if Python is installed with the following command:

.. code:: bash

    python --version

If this doesn't return 3.6 or higher, then Python isn't or not correctly
installed.

Most likely, the enviroment variables aren't configured correctly. Follow
our detailed step-by-step instructions to install Python correctly on
`Windows <https://asreview.nl/installation-guide-windows/>`__
and `MacOS <https://asreview.nl/installation-guide-macos/>`__.

However, there is a simple way to deal with correct environment variables
by ading `python -m` in front of the command. For example:

.. code:: bash

  python -m pip install asreview


Unknown command "asreview"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some situations, the entry point "asreview" can not be found after installation.
First check whether the package is correctly installed. Do this with the command
`python -m asreview -h`. If this shows a decription of the program, use
`python -m` in front of all your commands. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m asreview lab


Build dependencies error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command line returns the following message:

.. code:: bash

  "Installing build dependencies ... error"

This error typically happens when the version of your Python installation has been
released very recently. Because of this, the dependencies of ASReview are not
compatible with your Python installation yet. It is advised to install
the second most recent version of Python instead. Detailed step-by-step instructions
to install Python (and ASReview) are available for
`Windows <https://asreview.nl/installation-guide-windows/>`__ and
`MacOS <https://asreview.nl/installation-guide-macos/>`__ users.

Remove temporary files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case ASReview runs into unexpected errors or doesn't work as expected, it
is advised to try to remove temporary files from the project first. These
files can be found in the ``.asreview/`` folder in your home directory.
However, the easiest way to remove these files is with:

.. code:: bash

  asreview lab --clean_all_projects

This will safely remove temporay files, nothing will harm your review. To
clean a specific project, use

.. code:: bash

  asreview lab --clean_project my-project

in which ``my_project`` is your project name.
