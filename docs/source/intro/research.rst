========

The open source ASReview LAB software is one of the products of the ASReview
research project. The ASReview research project is a fundamental research
project studying the application of AI in the field of systematic reviews. In
short, ASReview LAB is written by researchers for researchers.

Every decision made by the team aligns with the `five fundamental principles
of ASReview <https://asreview.nl/blog/the-zen-of-elas/>`_: (1) Humans are the
Oracle; (2) Code is open & results are transparent; (3) Decisions are
unbiased; (4) The interface shows an AI is at work; and (5) Users are
responsible for importing high quality data.

A `multidisciplinary team <https://asreview.nl/about/>`_ works on the
ASReview-project. The scientifically oriented project contains a collection of
`Github repositories <https://github.com/asreview>`_, `scientific research
<https://asreview.nl/research/>`_ projects and `teaching activities
<https://asreview.nl/academy/>`_.
