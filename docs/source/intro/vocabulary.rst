|                  | The records can contain both information that is used for |

| model**          |                                                           |
|                  | The model consists of several elements: a query strategy, |
|                  | a feature extraction technique, a classifier, and a       |
|                  | balance strategy.                                         |

| **Finished**     | Whenever **the user decides** that the reviewing process  |
|                  | has been completed or if **all records are labeled**.     |

+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| **Published**    | Whenever the data and **ASReview project file**           |
|                  | are openly published on, for example, the OSF.            |
|                  |                                                           |
