| **Records**      | The data points that need to be labeled.                  |
|                  | The records contain both information that is used for     |
|                  | training the active learning model, and information that  |
|                  | is not used for this purpose.                             |

|                  | In the case of systematic reviews, a record is a          |

|                  | used for training purposes is the text in the title and   |

|                  | for example, the authors, journal, or DOI of the          |
|                  | publication.                                              |

|                  | The model consists of several elements: a query strategy, |
|                  | a feature extraction technique, a classifier, and a       |
|                  | balance strategy.                                         |

+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| **Finished**     | Whenever **the user decides** that the reviewing process  |
|                  | has been completed **or all records are labeled**.        |

| **Published**    | Whenever the data and **ASReview project file**           |
|                  | are openly published on, for example, OSF.                |
|                  |                                                           |
