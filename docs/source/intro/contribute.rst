Donate

Although the ASReview software is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), the
development is not. We are research-focused and not a commercial company
(which we do not want to become). So, if you want to contribute, consider
donating some money via our `crowdfunding platform
<https://steun.uu.nl/project/help-us-to-make-covid-19-research-accessible-to-
everyone>`_. Even small donations are highly appreciated!
