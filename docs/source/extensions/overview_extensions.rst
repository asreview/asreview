Overview
========

ASReview has support for extensions, which are a nice way to extend the
functionality of the :doc:`ASReview LAB <../lab/overview_lab>` software or the
:doc:`command line interface <../API/cli>`. There are :ref:`officially
supported extensions<extensions-official>` and :ref:`community'<extensions-community>`
contributions. There is extensive documentation on how to add new :ref:`models
<extensions-dev-model>` (i.e., classifiers, query strategies, balance
strategies, or feature extraction techniques) or completely new
:ref:`subcommands <extensions-dev-subcommand>`.


.. _extensions-official:

Offically Supported Extensions
------------------------------


The following extensions are officially supported and were developed as part
of the core project:

- :doc:`extension_covid19`: Make literature on COVID-19 available in ASReview.
- :doc:`extension_visualization`: Plotting functionality for state files 
  produced by ASReview.
- :doc:`extension_wordcloud`: Create a visual impression of the contents of 
  datasets via a wordcloud.
- `ASReview-statistics <https://github.com/asreview/asreview-statistics>`__: 
  Tool to give some basic properties of a dataset, such as number of papers, 
  number of inclusions. 

.. - `ASReview-vocab-extractor <https://github.com/asreview/asreview-extension-vocab-extractor>`__: This extension adds two feature extractors that extract vocabulary and vector matrices during simulation phases.
.. - ``asreview-hyperopt``: Optimize the hyperparameters of the models in ASReview. `GitHub <https://github.com/asreview/asreview-hyperopt>`__



.. _extensions-community:

Community-maintained extensions
-------------------------------

ASReview has support for community-maintained extensions, that enable you to 
seemlessly integrate your code with the ASReview framework. These extensions 
can extend the software with new subcommands, models, and datasets.

The following extensions are developed and maintained by the ASReview community:

* ASReview CNN classifier 
    - This ASReview extension adds a convolutional neural network (CNN) model 
      for use during the simulation phase.
    - `Github <https://github.com/JTeijema/asreview-plugin-model-cnn-17-layer>`__

* ASReview Model Switcher 
    - This extention adds a model that switches between two models during 
      runtime. It can be useful for when later stages of data classification 
      require different models.
    - `Github <https://github.com/JTeijema/asreview-plugin-model-switcher>`__


If an extension is not on this list, or you made one and you would like it to 
be added to this list, please initiate an issue on `Github
<https://github.com/asreview/asreview/issues>`__.
