Overview
========

ASReview has support for extensions, which are a nice way to extend the
functionality of the :doc:`ASReview LAB <../lab/overview_lab>` software or the
:doc:`command line interface <../API/cli>`. There are :ref:`officially
supported extensions<extensions-official>` and :ref:`community'<extensions-community>`
contributions. There is extensive documentation on how to add new :ref:`models
<extensions-dev-model>` (i.e., classifiers, query strategies, balance
strategies, or feature extraction techniques) or completely new
:ref:`subcommands <extensions-dev-subcommand>`.
