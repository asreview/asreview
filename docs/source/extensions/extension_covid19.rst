ASReview against COVID-19
=========================

For many questions from medical doctors, journalists, policy makers the
scientific literature on COVID-19 needs to be checked in a systematic way to
avoid biased decision-making. For example, to develop evidence-based medical
guidelines to transparently support medical doctors. Medical guidelines rely on
comprehensive systematic reviews. Such reviews entail several explicit and
reproducible steps, including identifying all likely relevant papers in a
standardized way, extracting data from eligible studies, and synthesizing the
results into medical guidelines. One might need to manually scan hundreds, or
even thousands of COVID-19 related studies. This process is error prone and
extremely time consuming; time we do not have right now!

The software relies on :doc:`Active learning <../guides/activelearning>` which
denotes the scenario in which the reviewer is labeling data that are presented
by a machine learning model. The machine learns from the reviewersâ€™ decisions
and uses this knowledge in selecting the reference that will be presented to the
reviewer next. In this way, the COVID-19 related papers are presented in an
orderly manner, that is from most to least relevant based on the input from the
user. The goal of the software is to help scholars and practitioners to get an
overview of the most relevant papers for their work as efficiently as possible,
while being transparent in the process.



ASReview Extension
------------------

To help combat the COVID-19 crisis, the ASReview team developed an extension
that provides two different datasets on COVID-19. These are automatically
available in ASReview after installing the extension, so reviewers can start
reviewing the latest scientific literature on COVID-19 as soon as possible!

CORD-19 dataset
---------------

The Cord19 database, found in full at `CORD-19 dataset
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10706>`_, is developed by the `Allen Institute for
AI <https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19>`_. It contains all publications on
COVID-19 and other coronavirus research (e.g. SARS, MERS, etc.) from PubMed
Central, the WHO COVID-19 database of publications, the preprint servers bioRxiv
and medRxiv and papers contributed by specific publishers.

In addition to the full dataset, there is a subset available of studies
published after December 1st, 2019 to search for relevant papers published
during the COVID-19 crisis.

The datasets are updated in ASReview extension shortly after a release by
the Allen Institute for AI.

Preprint dataset
-----------------

A separate dataset of COVID-19 related `preprints
<https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/covid19_preprints>`_. It contains metadata
of preprints from over 15 preprints servers across disciplines, published since
January 1, 2020. The preprint dataset is updated weekly by the maintainers
(Nicholas Fraser and Bianca Kramer) and is subsequently updated in ASReview. As
this dataset is not readily available to researchers through regular search
engines (e.g. PubMed), its inclusion in ASReview provides added value to
researchers interested in COVID-19 research, especially for those looking to
screen preprints specifically.


Installation and usage
----------------------

The COVID-19 extension requires ASReview 0.9.4 or higher. Install ASReview
by following the instructions in :doc:`../intro/installation`.

Install the extension with pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install asreview-covid19

The datasets are immediately available after starting ASReview.

.. code:: bash

    asreview lab

The datasets are selectable in Step 2 of the project initialization. For more
information on the usage of ASReview, have a look at the :doc:`../lab/oracle`.
