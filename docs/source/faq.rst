Is it possible to get the inclusion likelihood for unlabelled papers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, no. Getting unbiased estimates for inclusion probabilities is a hard problem,
especially in combination with active learning. Internally, we have scores that signify which
papers are more likely included, but to avoid confusion, we do not put these in the export
file. They are however available in the state files.
