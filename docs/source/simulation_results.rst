Analyzing results
=================

After a simulation, the results are stored in the ASReview project file
(extension `.asreview`). This file contains a large number of variables and
logs on the simulation. The data can be extracted from the project file via the API or with one of the available extensions. See :doc:`these examples on the Project API <example_api_asreview_file>` for more information about opening the project file. 

An easier solution would be to use the extension `ASReview Insights <https://github.com/asreview/asreview-insights>`_, which offers useful tools,
like plotting functions and metrics, to analyze results of a simulation.

Install ASReview Insights directly from PyPi:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install asreview-insights

Detailed documention can found on the `ASReview Insights GitHub <https://github.com/asreview/asreview-insights>`_ page.
