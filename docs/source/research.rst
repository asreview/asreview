========

The open source ASReview LAB software is one of the products of the `ASReview
research project <https://asreview.ai/about/>`_. The ASReview research project
is a fundamental and applied research project studying the application of AI
in the field of systematic reviews. The research is conducted by the research
team, partners, and contributors. ASReview LAB is stable and validated by the
scientific community `(Van de Schoot et al., 2020)
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00287-7>`_. In short, ASReview LAB
is written by researchers for researchers.

The team defined and implements the `five fundamental principles of ASReview
<https://asreview.ai/blog/the-zen-of-elas/>`_:

1. Humans are the oracle;
2. Code is open & results are transparent;
3. Decisions are unbiased;
4. The interface shows an AI is at work;
5. Users are responsible for importing high quality data.
