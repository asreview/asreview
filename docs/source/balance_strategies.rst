Balance Strategies
==================

There are several balance strategies that rebalance and reorder the
training data. This is sometimes necessary, because the data is often
very inbalanced: there are many more papers that should be excluded than
included (otherwise, automation cannot help much anyway).

Parameters in the config file should be under the section
``[balance_param]``.

We have currently implemented the following balance strategies:

Full Sampling
-------------

See :func:`asr.balance_strategies.full_sample`

This just uses all the data.

Undersampling
--------------

See :func:`asr.balance_strategies.undersample`

This undersamples the data, leaving out excluded papers so that the
included and excluded papers are in some particular ratio (closer to
one). Configuration options are as follows:

.. code:: ini

   # Shuffle the samples
   shuffle=True

   # Set the ratio of included/excluded to 1
   ratio=1.0

Triple Balance
--------------

See :func:`asr.balance_strategies.triple_balance`

This divides the training data into three sets: included papers,
excluded papers found with random sampling and papers found with max
sampling. They are balanced according to forumlaâ€™s depending on the
percentage of papers read in the dataset, the number of papers with
random/max sampling etc. Works best for stochastic training algorithms.

.. code:: ini

   # Shuffle the samples
   shuffle=True

   # Start with a random/max weight ratio of 10 at 0% read papers.
   rand_max_b=10

   # Decay to 1 with the following decay exponent:
   rand_max_alpha=1.0

   # Decrease the included/excluded ratio with the power:
   one_zero_beta=0.6

   # Cap the included/excluded ratio at:
   one_zero_delta=0.16
