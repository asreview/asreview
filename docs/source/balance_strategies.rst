Balance Strategies
==================

There are several balance strategies that rebalance and reorder the
training data. This is sometimes necessary, because the data is often
very inbalanced: there are many more papers that should be excluded than
included (otherwise, automation cannot help much anyway).

Parameters in the config file should be under the section
``[balance_param]``.

We have currently implemented the following balance strategies:

simple
------

Use all training data.

See :class:`asreview.balance_strategies.SimpleBalance`

undersample
-----------


This undersamples the data, leaving out excluded papers so that the
included and excluded papers are in some particular ratio (closer to
one). Configuration options are as follows:

.. code:: ini

   # Set the ratio of included/excluded to 1
   ratio=1.0

See :class:`asreview.balance_strategies.UndersampleBalance`

triple
------

This divides the training data into three sets: included papers,
excluded papers found with random sampling and papers found with max
sampling. They are balanced according to forumlaâ€™s depending on the
percentage of papers read in the dataset, the number of papers with
random/max sampling etc. Works best for stochastic training algorithms.
Reduces to both full sampling and undersampling with corresponding
parameters.

.. code:: ini

 	one_a=2.155
 	one_alpha=0.94
 	zero_b=0.789
 	zero_beta=1.0
 	zero_max_c=0.835
 	zero_max_gamma=2.0
 	shuffle=True

See :class:`asreview.balance_strategies.TripleBalance`

double
------

Same as triple balance, except that it doesn't have a difference between max or random 
sampling.
