Overview
========

ASReview LAB Server is designed to provide a secure and personalized
environment for each user. By setting up authentication, users can manage
their projects in individual workspaces, ensuring that their work remains
private and secure. Users are responsible for hosting and managing the server
on which ASReview LAB Server runs.

Some advantages:

- **User Workspaces**: Each user has their own workspace, which isolates their projects and settings from others.
- **Project Management**: Authentication allows for a clear association between user accounts and their respective projects.
- **Data Storage**: User accounts and project information are securely stored within a database.
