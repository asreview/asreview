ASReview: Active learning for Systematic Reviews
************************************************

ASReview is a project to accelerate the process of systematic reviewing.
It is written in python, and uses deep learning to predict which papers should be
most likely included in the review. Our software is designed to accelerate the step
of screening abstracts and titles with a minimum of papers to be read by a
human with no or very few false negatives.

ASReview software implements two different modes:

- **ASReview LAB** This modus is used to perform a systematic review with
  interaction by the reviewer (the 'oracle' in literature on active learning).
  The software presents papers to the reviewer, whereafter the reviewer classifies them.
- **Simulate** The simulation modus is used to measure
  the performance of the active learning software on the results of fully labeled systematic
  reviews. To use the simulation mode, knowledge on programming and bash/Command Prompt
  is highly recommanded.

`GitHub <https://github.com/asreview/asreview>`_.
