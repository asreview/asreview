ASReview LAB: Active learning for Systematic Reviews
====================================================

Welcome to the ASReview LAB Documentation!

ASReview LAB is a user-friendly software for exploring the future of AI in systematic
reviews. Three modes are implemented as follows:

- In :doc:`../lab/oracle`, you can review your dataset with interactive artificial
  intelligence (AI).
- In :doc:`../lab/exploration`, you can explore or demonstrate ASReview LAB with a
  completely labeled dataset. This mode is suitable for teaching purposes.
- In :doc:`../lab/simulation`, you can simulate a review on a completely labeled dataset
  to see the performance of ASReview LAB.

This documentation contains a complete guide to using ASReview LAB. If you need more
help, please find answers or ask experts in the ASReview community on `GitHub
