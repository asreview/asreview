ASReview: Software for Active Systematic Reviews
****************************************************

Active Systematic Review (ASReview) is software designed to accelerate the process of systematic reviews.
It is written in python, and uses deep learning to predict which papers should be
most likely included in the review. Our software is designed to accelerate the step
of screening abstracts and titles with a minimum of papers to be read by a
human with no or very few false negatives.

ASReview implements an oracle and a simulation mode.

- **Oracle** The oracle modus is used to perform a systematic review with
  interaction by the reviewer (the 'oracle' in literature on active learning).
  The software presents papers to the reviewer, whereafter the reviewer classifies them as relevant or not.
- **Simulation** The simulation modus is used to measure the performance of our
  software on existing systematic reviews. The software shows how many
  papers you could have potentially skipped during the systematic review.
