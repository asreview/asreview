Overview
========

ASReview has support for extensions. Extensions are a nice way to extend the
functionality of the :doc:`ASReview LAB <../lab/overview_lab>` software or the
:doc:`command line interface <../API/cli>`. See the following officially supported
extensions of ASReview:

- :doc:`covid19`: Make literature on COVID-19 available in ASReview.
- :doc:`plugin_visualization`: Plotting functionality for state files produced by ASReview.
- ``asreview-statistics``: Tool to give some basic properties of a dataset, such as number of
  papers, number of inclusions. `GitHub <https://github.com/asreview/asreview-statistics>`__
- ``asreview-hyperopt``: Optimize the hyperparameters of the models in ASReview. `GitHub <https://github.com/asreview/asreview-hyperopt>`__

If an extension is not on this list, or you make one and want it added to this
list, make an issue on `github
<https://github.com/asreview/asreview/issues>`__.
