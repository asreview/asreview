10203431,Quality of life in arthritis patients using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.,"Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Anti-Ulcer Agents; Arthritis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Omeprazole; Peptic Ulcer; Quality of Life","Wiklund, I","Arthritis is a painful and disabling condition. To suppress the pain and the inflammatory process, patients are often chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) users. Chronic use of NSAIDs may induce peptic ulcer, dyspeptic problems and heartburn. Therefore, these patients are often provided with treatment to relieve and/or protect against gastrointestinal problems. Rheumatic disorders also affect a range of health-related quality of life domains. In one study, patients with NSAID-associated gastroduodenal lesions complained about lack of energy, sleep disturbances, emotional distress and social isolation in addition to pain and mobility limitations. The degree of distress and dysfunction differed markedly from scores in an unselected population. Clinical trial data suggest that acid-suppressing therapy with omeprazole is superior to therapy with misoprostol and ranitidine in healing gastroduodenal lesions and preventing abdominal pain, heartburn and indigestion symptoms during continued NSAID treatment. Because arthritic patients are severely incapacitated by their condition regarding most aspects of health-related quality of life, it is important to offer a treatment that is effective in healing and preventing NSAID-induced ulcers and gastrointestinal symptoms during continued NSAID treatment without further compromising the patients' quality of life. Treatment with omeprazole once daily has been shown to be superior to that with ranitidine and misoprostol in this respect.",E,E
10234601,The safety profile of nonprescription ibuprofen in multiple-dose use: a meta-analysis.,"Adult; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Ibuprofen; Male; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Kellstein, D E; Waksman, J A; Furey, S A; Binstok, G; Cooper, S A","A meta-analysis was performed to compare the incidence of adverse experiences (AEs) during the multiple-dose use of nonprescription ibuprofen to a placebo. Eight studies, with doses ranging from 800 to 1200 mg/day and durations of 1 to 10 days, met the criteria for inclusion. AEs were classified according to COSTART, except that ""abdominal pain"" was conservatively reassigned to the digestive system. In each study, the overall AE frequency among ibuprofen-treated subjects (n = 1094) was numerically less than or equal to the placebo (n = 1093). Pooled across all studies, placebo subjects reported AEs significantly (p = 0.018) more often (31.7%) than ibuprofen subjects (27.4%). The frequency of digestive system AEs was comparable (p = 0.420) for the placebo (11.0%) and ibuprofen (12.1%); there was no significant difference for any specific digestive system AE. AE frequency in the ""body-as-a-whole"" category was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the placebo (20.4%) than in ibuprofen (14.8%). The number of severe AEs in all of these categories was lower for ibuprofen than for the placebo. These data indicate that nonprescription ibuprofen has an excellent side effect profile in multiple-dose use, with a frequency of gastrointestinal AEs comparable to a placebo.",I,5

A one year versus a 6 weeks non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug trial.,"Adult; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Compliance; Piroxicam; Prospective Studies; Spondylitis, Ankylosing; Thiazines; Thiazoles; Treatment Outcome","Dougados, M; Gueguen, A; Nakache, J P; Velicitat, P; Veys, E M; Zeidler, H; Calin, A","To consider the relevance of the duration of a clinical trial in ankylosing spondylitis: long-term (i.e. 1 yr) vs short-term (i.e. 6 weeks) assessment of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-placebo controlled study.; The design was a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks duration with a 12 months double-blind extension. Study drugs were placebo (n = 121) or active NSAID (n = 352). A decrease of at least 50% in pain and/or global assessment and/or functional impairment during the study defined the response to treatment. The percentage of patients discontinuing the study drug over time (life table analysis) permitted the evaluation of both the efficacy and toxicity.; Among the 473 recruited patients, the percentage of responders was similar at 1 yr and week 6 with a highly statistically significant difference in favour of the active NSAID groups when compared to placebo (at 1 yr, 17% in the placebo group vs 37, 50 and 43% in the piroxicam 20 mg, meloxicam 15 mg and meloxicam 22.5 mg, respectively, for the patient's overall assessment) without any statistically significant difference between the three active groups. However, evaluation of the patients discontinuing the study drug during the 1 yr of the study permitted the detection of a statistically significant difference between the active NSAID groups. A lower percentage of patients taking meloxicam 22.5 mg had to discontinue the study drug when compared to either meloxicam 15 mg or piroxicam 20 mg (37% vs 53% and 53%, respectively, P < 0.05). By 52 weeks, drug-related upper gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in 13, 32, 20 and 18% in the placebo, piroxicam 20 mg, meloxicam 15 mg and meloxicam 22.5 mg groups, respectively. Some of the adverse events occurred only after week 6.; This study suggests that a 1 yr trial might be of optimum value compared to a 6 week assessment in order to define better the efficacy and tolerability of NSAIDs in ankylosing spondylitis.",E,E

The abilities of nimesulide to inhibit COX-2 preferentially and to exert other novel anti-inflammatory actions are consistent with good efficacy and safety. This is borne out by a double-blind multicentre comparison of nimesulide and diclofenac in 122 patients with acute shoulder, and by a meta-analysis of various nimesulide trials. At the end of the 14 day double-blind study, nimesulide was at least as effective as diclofenac (investigator ratings: good/very good in 79.0% of patients given nimesulide, and 78.0% with diclofenac; patient ratings: good/very good in 82.3 and 78.0% respectively). Four patients (6.5%) dropped out in the nimesulide group (two early recovery, one lack of effect, one adverse event), compared with 13 (21.7%) in the diclofenac group, due mainly to adverse events (P=0.003). Global tolerability was judged by the investigators to be good/very good in 96.8% of the nimesulide group compared with 72.9% of those given diclofenac. Judgements by the patients were 96.8 and 78.0% respectively. Both differences are highly significant statistically. The meta-analysis demonstrates that nimesulide given for 2 weeks is far more efficacious than placebo in treating osteoarthritis, and is at least comparable to other NSAIDs The benefit-risk ratio for nimesulide was better in all individual studies since 100 mg nimesulide twice daily was about equal to placebo in safety and tolerability, especially regarding gastrointestinal adverse events.",I,3
10369405,"Economic comparison of nimesulide and diclofenac, and the incidence of adverse events in the treatment of rheumatic disease in Greece.","Ambulatory Care; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors; Diclofenac; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Greece; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Rheumatic Diseases; Sulfonamides","Liaropoulos, L","In Greece a 15-day treatment of rheumatic disease with diclofenac costs 56% more than treatment with nimesulide. This is due to the lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events with nimesulide, and the absence of serious gastrointestinal complications leading to hospitalization, which more than offset the higher acquisition cost of nimesulide. The average saving by using nimesulide instead of diclofenac is about US$21 per patient for a 15-day treatment period.",E,E

The mucosae were evaluated by endoscopy using a predefined scale; scores could range from 0 to 4. The primary end-point was the percentage of subjects who developed a mucosal score >/= 2 (i.e. the development of one or more erosions). To evaluate COX-1 activity, serum thromboxane B2 levels were determined in a subset of the population.; The percentage of subjects who developed a mucosal score >/= 2 in the MK-0966 group (12%) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than that in the ibuprofen (71%) and aspirin (94%) groups, and was similar to that in the placebo group (8%). Only ibuprofen and aspirin significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced baseline thromboxane B2 levels. All treatments were generally well tolerated.; In this acute short-term endoscopic study, MK-0966 250 mg q.d.

The objective of this parallel-group, double-masked, randomized, placebo- and active comparator-controlled clinical trial was to assess more fully the analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib in the treatment of postoperative dental pain. After dental surgery, 151 patients (50.3% women; mean age, 18.3 years; 93.4% white) experiencing moderate-to-severe pain were to receive a single dose of placebo, rofecoxib 50 mg, or ibuprofen 400 mg. Analgesic efficacy was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose using self-administered questionnaires. Tolerability was assessed using spontaneous reports of adverse experiences, physical findings, and laboratory measurements. The results of this study demonstrated that rofecoxib 50 mg was more effective than placebo on all measures of analgesic efficacy. Rofecoxib 50 mg exhibited overall analgesic effects, onset of analgesia, and peak analgesic effects that were not significantly different from those of ibuprofen 400 mg, with a significantly longer duration of action (P < 0.05). We concluded that rofecoxib was efficacious in the treatment of postoperative dental pain and that COX-2-derived prostanoids play a role in treatment of the pain associated with dental surgery.",4,E

This study tested whether nabumetone has effects different from those of indomethacin on exercise-induced changes in renal function and the renin-aldosterone system. In a randomized fashion, ten subjects were studied after indomethacin (100 mg), nabumetone (1 g) or no medication (control) administered orally at 22.00 hours on the day before each study day, and again at 8.00 hours upon arrival at the laboratory. Renal function was studied at baseline, during graded 20-min exercise sessions at 25%, 50% and 75% of the maximal oxygen uptake rate, and subsequently during two 1-h recovery periods. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and plasma catecholamines at rest and during exercise were not altered by indomethacin or nabumetone. Indomethacin decreased urinary rates of excretion of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F(1alpha) (6-oxo-PGF(1alpha)) and thromboxane B(2) in all study periods. Nabumetone decreased 6-oxo-PGF(1alpha) excretion during and after exercise. Excretion rates for PGE(2) did not change. Neither indomethacin nor nabumetone changed baseline values or exercise-induced decreases in renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate. Indomethacin, but not nabumetone, decreased sodium excretion, urine flow rate and free water clearance. The renal response to exercise, however, remained unchanged. In contrast with nabumatone, indomethacin decreased the plasma renin concentration. Thus, during exercise, nabumetone may decrease the excretion of 6-oxo-PGF(1alpha) by inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-1 or by inhibition of specific exercise-induced activation of cyclo-oxygenase-2, or both. None of the drugs changed the renal response to exercise. Inhibition by indomethacin of angiotensin II and thromboxane A(2) synthesis may, during exercise, counterbalance renal vasoconstriction caused by blockade of vasodilatory prostaglandins.",E,E

In recent studies, the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor rofecoxib demonstrated analgesic effects similar to those of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea. The present randomized, single-dose, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group study was undertaken to compare the analgesic efficacy of the COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib 50 mg and celecoxib 200 mg with that of ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo in patients with postoperative dental pain. Two hundred and seventy-two patients experiencing pain after the removal of > or =2 third molars were randomized according to pain severity (moderate vs severe) to receive a single dose of placebo (n = 45), rofecoxib 50 mg (n = 90), celecoxib 200 mg (n = 91), or ibuprofen 400 mg (n = 46). Using a patient diary, patients recorded pain intensity, pain relief, and global evaluations throughout the 24-hour period after dosing. The overall analgesic effect, onset of action, peak effect, and duration of effect were evaluated, with the primary end point being total pain relief over 8 hours (TOPAR8). The safety profile was assessed on the basis of physical findings, laboratory results, and spontaneous reports of adverse experiences. The results showed that compared with celecoxib, rofecoxib had superior analgesic effects on all measures of analgesic efficacy, including overall analgesic effect (TOPAR8, 18.3 vs. 12.5; P<0.001), time to onset of effect (30 vs. 60 minutes; P = 0.003), peak pain relief (score, 2.8 vs 2.3; P<0.05), and duration of effect (>24 vs. 5.1 hours; P<0.001). In addition, rofecoxib's analgesic efficacy was similar to that of ibuprofen (TOPAR8, 18.3 vs. 17.0; P = 0.460), but the duration was longer (P<0.05); with ibuprofen, the time to on set was 24 minutes, peak pain relief score was 2.9, and duration of analgesic effect was 8.9 hours. The safety profile was similar across all treatment groups. Thus rofecoxib provided analgesic efficacy superior to that of celecoxib and comparable to that of ibuprofen in the treatment of patients with acute postoperative dental pain.",E,E

(NSAIDs) inhibit both cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes and are effective in the treatment of inflammatory disorders. This 8-week, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken to assess the safety profile, tolerability, and effective dose range of once-daily rofecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). After a 3- to 15-day washout of prior NSAID therapy, 658 patients were randomly allocated to receive placebo or rofecoxib 5 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg once daily. Safety profile, tolerability, and efficacy were evaluated after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of therapy. Six hundred fifty-eight patients (168, 158, 171, and 161 in the placebo and 5-mg, 25-mg, and 50-mg rofecoxib groups, respectively) were enrolled at 79 clinical centers in the United States. Mean age was 55 years, mean duration of RA was 10 years, and 506 (77%) of the 658 patients were female. All groups had similar baseline demographic characteristics. Patients taking rofecoxib 25 and 50 mg showed significant clinical improvement compared with those taking placebo; 43.9% in the rofecoxib 25-mg group and 49.7% in the rofecoxib 50-mg group completed the treatment period and achieved an American College of Rheumatology 20 response (P = 0.025 and 0.001 vs. placebo, respectively). The 5-mg dose of rofecoxib did not differ significantly from placebo. Patients in the rofecoxib 25- and 50-mg groups showed significant improvement in key individual efficacy measurements, including patient global assessment of pain, patient and investigator global assessment of disease activity, and Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (P<0.05 vs placebo). Compared with placebo, significantly fewer patients in the 25-mg and 50-mg rofecoxib groups discontinued therapy because of lack of efficacy (P = 0.02 and P = 0.032, respectively). Our results show that rofecoxib 25 and 50 mg once daily was effective and generally well-tolerated in patients with RA.",I,3

Effects of indomethacin, the selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors NS-398 and DFU, and dexamethasone on gastric damage induced by 30 min ischaemia followed by 60 min reperfusion (I-R) were investigated in rats. Modulation of gastric levels of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA by I-R was evaluated using Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 2. I-R-induced gastric damage was dose-dependently aggravated by administration of indomethacin (1 - 10 mg kg(-1)), NS-398 (0.4 - 4 mg kg(-1)) or DFU (0.02 - 2 mg kg(-1)) as assessed macroscopically and histologically. 3. Likewise, administration of dexamethasone (1 mg kg(-1)) significantly increased I-R damage. 4. Low doses of 16, 16-dimethyl-prostaglandin(PG)E(2), that did not protect against ethanol-induced mucosal damage, reversed the effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitors, indomethacin and dexamethasone. 5. I-R had no effect on gastric COX-1 mRNA levels but increased COX-2 mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner. Dexamethasone inhibited the I-R-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA. 6. I-R was not associated with a measurable increase in gastric mucosal formation of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and PGE(2). PG formation was substantially inhibited by indomethacin (10 mg kg(-1)) but was not significantly reduced by NS-398 (4 mg kg(-1)), DFU (2 mg kg(-1)) or dexamethasone (1 mg kg(-1)). 7. The findings indicate that selective COX-2 inhibitors and dexamethasone markedly enhance gastric damage induced by I-R. Thus, whereas COX-2 has no essential role in the maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity under basal conditions, COX-2 is rapidly induced in a pro-ulcerogenic setting and contributes to mucosal defence by minimizing injury. This suggests that in certain situations selective COX-2 inhibitors may have gastrotoxic effects.",E,E

These NSCLC cells also have increased prostaglandin expression (PGE2). Many lung cancers also express 12-lipoxygenase RNA and 12-lipoxygenase protein and biosynthesize 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which correlates with their metastatic potential. Several studies have demonstrated that COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors could inhibit the in vitro growth of human lung cancer cell lines. In this report, we evaluated the growth-inhibitory effects of sulindac sulfide, a COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor; exisulind (sulindac sulfone), a novel proapoptotic agent that does not inhibit COX enzymes; and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor on human lung cancer cell lines. We compared these effects with those of 13-cis-retinoic acid, a chemoprevention agent, and with the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel and cisplatin, alone or in combination. Our goal was to develop new chemoprevention and treatment strategies. Each of the six agents tested inhibited the in vitro growth of three NSCLC and three SCLC cell lines at the highest concentration. Paclitaxel was the most potent agent (IC50 = 0.003-0.150 microM); sulindac sulfide, NDGA, and 13-cis-retinoic acid had intermediate potency (IC50 = 4-80 microM), and cisplatin and exisulind were the least potent (IC50 = 150-500 microM). Combination studies showed synergistic interactions for sulindac sulfide, exisulind, and NDGA with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and 13-cis-retinoic acid, regardless of drug-resistance phenotype. At high concentrations, the combination of 13-cis-retinoic acid and each of the five other drugs resulted in a strong synergistic effect. These studies provide a rationale for chemoprevention (exisulind +/- retinoic acid +/- NDGA) and therapeutic (exisulind +/- paclitaxel +/- cisplatin) studies in patients at risk for, or with, lung cancer.",E,E

Data were obtained from 11,008 patients in 14 double-masked trials of celecoxib in arthritis ranging from 4 to 24 weeks in duration.

The subset of patients with a history of sulfonamide hypersensitivity reactions had a 3-fold to 6-fold higher incidence of dermatologic reactions than did the entire arthritis trial cohort. Although dermatologic reactions occurred with greater frequency in patients with a history of sulfonamide hypersensitivity, the trend was consistent across all 3 treatment groups (celecoxib, NSAIDs, and placebo). According to these data and structural and metabolic differences between sulfonamides, the potential for cross-allergenicity between celecoxib and other sulfonamide-containing medications appears comparable to that of placebo and nonsulfonamide-containing NSAIDs. Additionally, the risk of allergic reactions with celecoxib appears comparable to that of placebo and comparator NSAIDs. Prospective trials are needed to confirm these findings.",I,5

The principal criterion for efficacy was pain intensity assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS) 15 minutes after drug intake. Pain intensity was further evaluated 30, 45, 90, 120, 180, 240 and 360 minutes after dosing. Pain relief was evaluated at the same time points by means of a categorical scale. The time point of first pain relief, the use of rescue medication and the global evaluation of efficacy were also recorded. The reduction in pain intensity was significantly more pronounced in the nimesulide beta cyclodextrin group at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes (p < 0.01). Pain relief was significantly greater (p < 0.05) and more rapid with nimesulide beta cyclodextrin.

LPS caused also dose-dependent elevations in urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor 6-keto PGF(1alpha) (PGI-M) and 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) (Tx-M). Platelet COX-1 inhibition by chronic administration of low-dose aspirin before LPS did not alter the symptomatic and febrile responses to LPS, but the increment in urinary PGI-M and Tx-M were both partially depressed. Pretreatment with ibuprofen, a nonspecific COX inhibitor, attenuated the febrile and systemic response to LPS and inhibited prostanoid biosynthesis. Both celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, and ibuprofen attenuated the pyrexial, but not the chronotropic, response to LPS. Experimental endotoxemia caused differential expression of the COX isozymes in monocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes ex vivo. LPS also increased urinary iPF(2alpha)-III, iPF(2alpha)-VI, and 8,12-iso-iPF(2alpha)-VI, isoprostane (iP) indices of lipid peroxidation, and none of the drugs blunted this response. These studies indicate that (a) although COX-2 predominates, both COX isozymes are induced and contribute to the prostaglandin response to LPS in humans; (b) COX activation contributes undetectably to lipid peroxidation induced by LPS; and (c) COX-2, but not COX-1, contributes to the constitutional response to LPS in humans.",E,E

The RCTs enrolled 11,008 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis treated for 2-24 wk; the long-term open label trial enrolled 5,155 patients receiving celecoxib for a maximum of 2 yr. In the RCTs, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 1,864; 208 patient-years), celecoxib 25-400 mg b.i.d. (n = 6,376; 1,020 patient-years), or a comparator NSAID (n = 2,768; 535 patient-years); NSAIDs were naproxen 500 mg b.i.d., diclofenac 50 or 75 mg b.i.d., or ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d.).

The principal outcome measure of this analysis was development of a UGI ulcer complication, which was prospectively defined as bleeding, perforation, or gastric outlet obstruction. Ulcer complications were assessed and adjudicated by persons blinded to the patient's treatment assignment or the study in which the patient participated.; In the RCTs, UGI ulcer complications occurred in no placebo patients (0 of 1,864 patients), in 2 of 6,376 celecoxib patients (0.03%), and in 9 of 2,768 patients receiving an NSAID (0.33%), corresponding to annual incidences of 0.20% for celecoxib (p > 0.05 vs placebo) and 1.68% for NSAIDs (p = 0.002 vs celecoxib and placebo). In the long-term open-label trial, nine UGI ulcer complications occurred, for an incidence of 0.17% and an annualized incidence of 0.18%.; The incidence of UGI ulcer complications associated with celecoxib was 8-fold lower than with nonspecific NSAIDs.

In previous studies, meloxicam has been found to be safe and effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) at doses of 7.5 to 15 mg daily. To evaluate a lower dose and a different patient population, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of meloxicam vs placebo and diclofenac for the treatment of OA among patients with symptom exacerbations.; In this double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicenter study, 774 patients with confirmed OA of the hip or knee and a flare were randomized and treated with daily oral administration of meloxicam tablets (at dosages of 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg/d), diclofenac (100 mg [50 mg twice daily]), or placebo. Treatment was for 12 weeks, with regular assessments for drug safety and efficacy. Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory data. Primary efficacy variables included the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index, the patient's overall assessment of pain, and the patient's and investigator's overall assessment of disease activity.; The incidence of all adverse events was lower at each dosage of meloxicam than for diclofenac but greater than for placebo. However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and dropout rates because of such events was the same for meloxicam as for placebo and lower than for diclofenac. Meloxicam, at 7.5 and 15 mg/d, and diclofenac were statistically significantly more effective than placebo for all end points, while the 3.75-mg/d dosage of meloxicam did not always reach statistical significance for all end points. Efficacy was evident after 2 weeks of treatment, improved with increasing doses, and was maintained until the end of the trial.; Meloxicam is a safe and effective medication for the symptomatic treatment of OA. The data support consideration of 7.5 to 15 mg of meloxicam once daily to treat the pain and stiffness of OA, with gastrointestinal tolerability comparable to that of placebo.

The roles of COX-1 and COX-2 in the pathogenesis of these symptoms are unclear. To test whether COX-2 inhibition with rofecoxib would have greater GI tolerability than nonselective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition, we compared the incidences of (1) treatment discontinuations for GI adverse events (AEs) and (2) prespecified dyspeptic-type GI AEs among patients with osteoarthritis treated with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs.; A prespecified, combined analysis of investigator-reported GI AEs in all 8 double-blind, randomized, phase 2b/3 osteoarthritis trials of rofecoxib was conducted. Patients included men and women with osteoarthritis (N = 5435); there was no upper age limit for entry. Treatments tested included rofecoxib, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg (combined), vs ibuprofen, diclofenac, or nabumetone (combined). Primary outcomes were the time (by survival analysis) to (1) treatment discontinuation due to GI AEs and (2) first reported dyspeptic-type GI AE. Between-treatment comparisons were made by log-rank test.; The number of treatment discontinuations caused by GI AEs during 12 months was significantly lower (P=.02) with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs (8.2 vs 12.0 per 100 patient-years; relative risk, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.94).

The analgesic efficacy of the cyclooxygenase-2 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, celecoxib and rofecoxib, have not been evaluated after major orthopedic surgery. This study was designed to determine whether the administration of a preoperative dose of celecoxib or rofecoxib to patients who have undergone spinal stabilization would decrease patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine use and/or enhance analgesia. We evaluated 60 inpatients undergoing spine stabilization by one surgeon. All patients received PCA morphine. The patients were divided into three groups. Preoperatively, they were given oral celecoxib 200 mg, rofecoxib 50 mg, or placebo. The outcome measures included pain scores and 24-h morphine use at six times during the first 24 postoperative h. The total dose of morphine and the cumulative doses for each of the six time periods were significantly more in the placebo group than in the other two groups. The morphine dose was significantly less in five of the six time intervals in the rofecoxib group compared with the celecoxib group. The pain scores were significantly less in the rofecoxib group than in the other two groups at two of the six intervals, and less than the placebo group in an additional interval. Although both rofecoxib and celecoxib produce similar analgesic effects in the first 4 h after surgery, rofecoxib demonstrated an extended analgesic effect that lasted throughout the 24-h study. We thus recommend that rofecoxib be used as a preoperative component of pain management that includes PCA morphine in patients undergoing spine stabilization surgery.; The cyclooxygenase-2-specific nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, celecoxib and rofecoxib, both demonstrate an opioid-sparing effect after spinal fusion surgery. Celecoxib resulted in decreased morphine use for the first 8 h after surgery, whereas rofecoxib demonstrated less morphine use throughout the 24-h study period.",E,E

Intravenous preparation of parecoxib is in Phase III clinical trials for the management of acute and severe post-surgical pain. It is the only COX-2 inhibitor that is available in a parenteral formulation. Clinical results compare parecoxib with ketorolac, a NSAID, which is the only non-narcotic analgesic available in parenteral formulation that can be administered for the relief of moderate to severe acute pain. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that parecoxib is converted to valdecoxib within a short time following administration by im. or iv. injection. In clinical trials, parecoxib compares favourably with ketorolac and produces less gastric or duodenal ulcers, the predominant adverse effect, than ketorolac. Parecoxib, thus, fulfils some of the desirable characteristics of an ideal non-narcotic analgesic for severe post-surgical pain and has application in other acutely painful conditions. Parecoxib is expected to be filed for approval before the end of 2000 and is expected to be introduced in the market in 2001.

""High-dose"" celecoxib (>20 microM) reduced the viability of all three cell lines in vitro as measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that this loss of viability was attributable to the induction of apoptosis. Significantly, concentrations of the drug <10 microM had no effect on cell viability in vitro. The cytotoxic effects of high-dose celecoxib were independent of COX-2 inhibition because similar effects were observed in cox-2 (+/+), cox-2 (+/-) and cox-2 (-/-) fibroblasts. A plasma concentration of 2.3+/-0.7 microM was achieved when celecoxib (1250 mg/kg of chow) was fed to animals ad libitum. Despite a lack of toxicity at 2-3 microM celecoxib in vitro, there was attenuation of HCA-7 xenograft growth in vivo.

Various approaches have been taken to developing NSAIDs with reduced gastrointestinal toxicity, and few have been successfully reduced the incidence of adverse reactions. These include cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors and nitric oxide (NO)-releasing NSAIDs. Especially, much has been written about the potential of COX-2 inhibitors as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents that lack the gastrointestinal side effects of traditional NSAIDs. COX-2 expression is most evident at sites of inflammation, while COX-1 accounts for the majority of prostaglandin synthesis in the normal gastrointestinal tract. However, there are distinct examples of circumstances in which COX-2-derived prostaglandins play a role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal mucosal integrity, particularly when the mucosa is injured, and the delineation of COX-1 and COX-2 might not be quite as clear as has been suggested. On the other hand, the rational behind the NO-releasing NSAIDs is that the NO released from the derivatives will exert beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa. This approach has been successfully demonstrated to lessen the incidence of gastrointestinal damage and to promote the healing of gastric ulcers. The present article overviews the roles of COX and NO in housekeeping functions of the gastrointestinal mucosa in various circumstances, and the effects of gastrointestinal sparing NSAIDs, mainly COX-2 selective inhibitors and NO-releasing derivatives of NSAIDs, on the ulcerogenic and healing responses in the gastrointestinal mucosa of experimental animals.",E,E

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study of two treatment groups (n = 12 per group) in which subjects received 50 mg of rofecoxib or placebo for 10 days in a blinded fashion. Subjects also received 81 mg aspirin once on each of days 4 through 10 in an open-label fashion.

Platelet-derived serum TXB2 (COX-1 assay) was measured in blood clotted for 1 hour at 37 degrees C. Platelet aggregation was independently induced employing 1 mM arachidonic acid and 1 microgram/mL collagen as agonists. Rofecoxib administered alone had no significant effect on serum TXB2 production or platelet aggregation (day 4). TXB2 production was inhibited 98.4% by aspirin coadministered with either rofecoxib or placebo (day 10).

Acutely, NSAIDs may be more than mild analgesics, and may provide additional analgesia when combined with opioids. However, NSAIDs have ceiling effects and there is no therapeutic gain from increasing dosages beyond those recommended. As there is no clearly superior NSAID, the choice should be based on experience and the toxicity profile that probably relates to the COX-1:COX-2 ratio. Among the older drugs, ibuprofen seems to have these properties.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to have an opioid-sparing effect. Although the value of a simple narcotic-sparing effect may be questioned in cancer pain treatment, the use of NSAIDs may be useful when the increase in opioid dosage determine the occurrence of opioid toxicity. Like opioids, NSAIDs should not be considered analgesics for a specific type or cause of pain. There is a lack of evidence for any difference between different routes of NSAIDs administration. The long-term toxicity of NSAIDs in cancer pain is poorly defined due to a lack of studies. A variety of strategies have been used in an attempt to reduce the risks associated with NSAID therapy. Those NSAIDs that are weak COX-1 inhibitors may be preferred. In addition, concomitant administration of misoprostol is recommended in patients at increased risk for upper gastrointestinal complications.",E,E

Biochemically selective inhibition of COX-2 reduces PGI(2) biosynthesis substantially in humans. Because deletion of the PGI(2) receptor accelerates atherogenesis in the fat-fed low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse, we wished to determine whether selective inhibition of COX-2 would accelerate atherogenesis in this model. To address this hypothesis, we used dosing with nimesulide, which inhibited COX-2 ex vivo, depressed urinary 2,3 dinor 6-keto PGF(1alpha) by approximately 60% but had no effect on thromboxane formation by platelets, which only express COX-1. By contrast, the isoform nonspecific inhibitor, indomethacin, suppressed platelet function and thromboxane formation ex vivo and in vivo, coincident with effects on PGI(2) biosynthesis indistinguishable from nimesulide. Indomethacin reduced the extent of atherosclerosis by 55 +/- 4%, whereas nimesulide failed to increase the rate of atherogenesis. Despite their divergent effects on atherogenesis, both drugs depressed two indices of systemic inflammation, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 to a similar but incomplete degree. Neither drug altered serum lipids and the marked increase in vascular expression of COX-2 during atherogenesis. Accelerated progression of atherosclerosis is unlikely during chronic intake of specific COX-2 inhibitors. Furthermore, evidence that COX-1-derived prostanoids contribute to atherogenesis suggests that controlled evaluation of the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or aspirin on plaque progression in humans is timely.",E,E

Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) is expressed under normal physiologic conditions, whereas COX-2, the inducible isoform, is associated with inflammation. Recent studies have linked COX-2 induction to the asthmatic inflammatory response, but potentially beneficial results, such as enhanced production of antiinflammatory and bronchoprotective substances, may also occur. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of selective COX-2 inhibition on bronchial responsiveness and cough reflex sensitivity. Eight adult subjects with stable asthma underwent spirometry, bronchoprovocation challenge with methacholine, and cough challenge testing with capsaicin, before and after a 7 day course of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (200 mg orally, twice daily) and placebo, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. No significant changes in pulmonary function, bronchial responsiveness, or cough reflex sensitivity were induced by celecoxib. It appears, therefore, that 1 week of therapy with celecoxib does not significantly affect basal airway tone, nor the afferent airway receptors controlling bronchoconstriction and cough. However, the results of this trial cannot be extrapolated to subjects with severe asthma, or those suffering an asthmatic exacerbation. In such conditions of enhanced inflammatory response, the role of selective COX-2 inhibition remains to be elucidated.",E,E

NSAIDs, through their inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, can affect the renal and cardiovascular systems. However, the majority of reported side-effects are related to the gastrointestinal (GI) system, and the occurrence of these GI events adds significantly to the disease burden. Several factors have been identified that contribute to the risk of an NSAID-associated GI event. However, when considering risk, especially in clinical trials or observational studies, it is necessary to distinguish between baseline risk and NSAID-attributable risk, since this distinction can affect the results and conclusions of the study; NSAID-attributable risk is present in subjects who have few or no risk factors for upper GI toxicity.

It has been suggested that as much as 38% of the elderly population would meet criteria for MCI and although the associated memory deficits are mild, the fact that up to 15% of MCI patients, particularly those with a particular type of memory impairment, convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) annually has prompted serious attention. Despite the high conversion rate, MCI cannot be used synonymously with early or mild AD, as patients with AD are impaired not only in memory performance but in other cognitive domains as well; they meet diagnostic criteria for dementia. However, since there is a high conversion rate from MCI to AD, it is likely many with MCI have the underlying neuropathology of AD, though they do not yet meet clinical diagnostic criteria. Therefore, treatment strategies developed for AD, specifically acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and Cox-2 inhibitors, have been among the first employed to treat MCI.

Measurements occurred at baseline and after 1, 2, and 6 weeks of treatment.; Eight hundred ten patients received study medication (celecoxib, n = 411; rofecoxib, n = 399). Nearly twice as many rofecoxib- compared with celecoxib-treated patients experienced edema (9.5% vs. 4.9%, P = 0.014). Systolic blood pressure increased significantly in 17% of rofecoxib- compared with 11% of celecoxib-treated patients (P = 0.032) at any study time point. Diastolic blood pressure increased in 2.3% of rofecoxib- compared with 1.5% of celecoxib-treated patients (P = 0.44). At week 6, the change from baseline in mean systolic blood pressure was +2.6 mmHg for rofecoxib compared with -0.5 mmHg for celecoxib (P = 0.007).; Patients taking antihypertensive therapy and receiving cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors should be monitored for the development of cardiorenal events. Patients receiving celecoxib experienced less edema and less destabilization of blood pressure control compared with those receiving rofecoxib.",I,I

As compared to conventional NSAIDs, celecoxib, a COX-2 specific inhibitor, has been shown in previous single posttreatment endoscopy studies to be associated with lower gastroduodenal ulcer rates. In response to concerns that such studies may under-represent ulceration rates, the present serial endoscopy study was designed to compare cumulative gastroduodenal ulcer rates associated with the use of celecoxib to those of naproxen, a conventional NSAID.; In this double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study, 537 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomized to treatment with celecoxib 200 mg b.i.d. (n = 270) or naproxen 500 mg b.i.d. (n = 267) for 12 wk. Gastroduodenal damage was determined from esophagogastroduodenoscopy after 4, 8, and 12 wk of therapy. Arthritis efficacy was evaluated with Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments.; Gastroduodenal ulcer rates after celecoxib and naproxen treatment were 4% versus 19% in the 0-4 wk interval (p < 0.001), 2% versus 14% in the 4-8 wk interval (p < 0.001), and 2% versus 10% in the 8-12 wk interval (p < 0.001), respectively. After 12 wk of treatment, the cumulative incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers was 9% with celecoxib and 41% with naproxen. In the celecoxib group, gastroduodenal ulcers were significantly associated with Helicobacter pylori status (p < 0.05), concurrent aspirin usage (p = 0.001), and a history of ulcer (p = 0.010), but not with disease type (OA/RA), age, gender, other relevant medical histories, or concurrent corticosteroid or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs usage (p > 0.05). Celecoxib produced a significantly lower incidence rate of both gastric (p < 0.001) and duodenal (p < 0.030) ulcers. The two agents produced similar improvements in Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments of arthritis efficacy. The incidence of adverse events and withdrawal rates did not differ significantly between treatments.; As compared to naproxen (500 mg b.i.d.), use of celecoxib (200 mg b.i.d.), a COX-2 specific agent, at the recommended RA dose and twice the most frequently prescribed OA dose, was associated with lower rates of gastric, duodenal, and gastroduodenal ulcers but had comparable efficacy, in patients with OA and RA.",I,I

Conventional treatment for these debilitating conditions routinely involves the use of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are nonspecific inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2. Numerous studies suggest that inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by NSAIDs is deleterious to kidney function, particularly in high-risk patients. As celecoxib inhibits COX-2 and spares COX-1 at therapeutic doses, we hypothesized that it may offer an improved renal safety profile in patients at risk for NSAID-induced renal toxicity. This article represents a post hoc analysis of the renal safety of celecoxib, using the safety database generated during its clinical development program. This analysis includes data from more than 50 clinical studies involving more than 13,000 subjects. Most subjects were enrolled in randomized, controlled trials (of up to 12 weeks' duration); however, more than 5000 subjects received celecoxib for as long as 2 years in a long-term, open-label study at as much as twice the maximum recommended dosage. The overall incidence of renal adverse events after celecoxib was greater than that after placebo but similar to that after NSAIDs. The most common events reported after celecoxib, namely, peripheral edema (2.1%), hypertension (0.8%), and exacerbation of preexisting hypertension (0.6%), were not time- or dose-related. Peripheral edema was not associated with increased weight or blood pressure. Furthermore, there was no evidence of drug-drug interactions between celecoxib and concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics. We conclude that celecoxib is well tolerated by patients who may be at risk for NSAID-induced renal toxicity, such as the elderly and those with hypertension or preexisting chronic heart disease.",I,8

Acute anti-inflammatory doses of flosulide and indomethacin were determined on carrageenan paw edema and its effects on renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were studied in normovolemic and hypovolemic rats. In normovolemic rats, flosulide increased RPF and GFR (25 mg/kg) and indomethacin (5-10 mg/kg) was without effect. Volume-depleted rats were obtained by oral furosemide (32 mg/kg), urinary eicosanoids were determined. After furosemide, plasma volume, RPF and GFR and PGE2 decreased. Treatment of hypovolemic rats with flosulide (5-25 mg/kg) or indomethacin 10 mg/kg reduced RPF and GFR. Flosulide at 5 mg/kg reduced 6-keto-PGF1alpha whereas at 25 mg/kg and after indomethacin at 10 mg/kg a fall in 6-keto-PGF1alpha and TXB2 appeared.

'Non-cases' were all reports of reactions other than these being studied. Amineptine and acetaminophen were used as 'positive controls'. Among the 42,913 adverse drug reactions recorded in the database between January 1995 and December 1997, 5708 (13 per cent) were liver injuries. In comparison with other drugs in the database, liver injuries were inversely associated with exposure to NSAIDs, whatever the class of the drugs (OR 0.3 [0.3-0.4]). In contrast, liver injuries were significantly related to acetaminophen (OR 2.1 [1.9-2.3]), and amineptine (OR 14.0 [10.5-18.7]). Naproxen and diclofenac were associated with a higher frequency of liver injuries, respectively 15.7 per cent and 11.5 per cent. The risk associated with NSAIDs alone significantly decreased when the analysis was performed after exclusion of hepatotoxic drugs associated with NSAIDs (except for naproxen). The present results show the low frequency of liver damage associated with NSAIDs. The main factor appears to be concomitant exposure to other hepatotoxic drugs.",E,E

Nimesulide was administered orally as 100 mg twice daily, and piroxicam was administered as 20 mg orally in the morning and placebo in the evening. These patients were stratified into two groups: clinical assessment and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the knee. All patients were followed for 8 weeks with clinical assessment every 2 weeks; of these, 11 patients were selected for magnetic resonance imaging evaluation, and they were treated for 24 weeks. The principal efficacy parameters were improvement in osteoarthritis severity index, joint tenderness, swelling, and functional capacity of the patients. The final judgment of efficacy was made by the physician. Nimesulide improved all primary and secondary efficacy parameters with an activity comparable to piroxicam. Significant reduction in joint swelling and tenderness was observed as early as 2 weeks in the two treatment groups; however, a greater number of patients were relieved in nimesulide group. At 8 and 24 weeks, the number of patients with no joint swelling were 66.7% versus 50% and 80% versus 66.7% in the nimesulide and piroxicam groups (P <.05). Functional capacity at 8 weeks improved in 72.2% of nimesulide and 44.4% of piroxicam recipients. Mild adverse effects, mainly gastrointestinal, considered possibly related to treatment were recorded in 4 patients treated with nimesulide and in 12 patients treated with piroxicam. No significant change in the articulating cartilage of the tibiofemoral joint was observed over a 24-week period with either treatment.

Celecoxib is an effective anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic agent therapeutically utilised in the management of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, celecoxib has some novel therapeutic and pharmacological activities. Celecoxib inhibits anti-apoptotic kinase activation and is the first specific COX-2 inhibitor to be marketed for familial adenomatous polyposis, an inheritable predisposition for colorectal cancer. Celecoxib is not without gastrointestinal (GI) side effects but demonstrates markedly reduced GI ulceration in clinical trials when compared to traditional non-specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The specific COX-2 inhibitors each have distinctive pharmacokinetic properties. Celecoxib can be given either once or twice daily. Racial differences in drug disposition, and pharmacokinetic changes in elderly patients, patients with chronic renal insufficiency and patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, are evident with celecoxib. Despite the specific action of these drugs, there remains the potential for significant drug interactions. Celecoxib has demonstrated interactions with fluconazole, lithium and warfarin. Increased clinical vigilance should be maintained when co-prescribing medications with celecoxib until further clinical experience is gained. Celecoxib represents a major therapeutic advance in terms of GI safety. However, long-term safety in other organ systems, safety with concomitant drug administration, and pharmacoeconomic benefits still remain to be proven.",E,E

Of the former, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used, and newer agents with cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) specific inhibition may have fewer renal side effects compared to non-selective NSAIDs. We therefore investigated whether combination of a COX-2 inhibitor with an angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor blocker is safe with regard to preservation of normal renal function in a state of slight volume contraction.; Mild volume depletion was induced by a salt-restricted diet in 5 healthy volunteers who were then given a single dose of 400 mg celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, alone or in combination with 150 mg irbesartan, an AT1 receptor blocker. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were determined by measuring inulin and PAH clearance respectively, along with plasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary electrolyte excretion before and over 100 minutes after drug administration.; PRA was high prior to drug administration, indicating slight salt depletion, and dropped by 65% after intake of celecoxib alone (p = 0.008) but only by 25% after combined intake with irbesartan (p = n.s.). GFR was not affected either by celecoxib alone or by combined administration with irbesartan. In contrast, ERPF increased by 28% 80 minutes after simultaneous drug intake (p = 0.029), but not after celecoxib alone. Renal sodium and potassium excretion did not significantly change under celecoxib alone or in combination with irbesartan.; Selective COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib in combination with an AT1 receptor blocker (irbesartan) has no acute adverse effects on renal haemodynamics and renal salt handling in slightly volume-depleted subjects with normal renal function. Moreover, our data obtained in humans appear to confirm the co-regulatory interaction of COX-2 and angiotensin II in the control of renin release, as suggested by animal studies.",E,E

Meloxicam 7.5 mg or piroxicam 20 mg daily was administered for 4 weeks in this double-blind parallel-groups randomised study. The efficacy for pain relief of the two tested medications was assessed by means of visual analogue scale and other clinical parameters. Pre- and post-treatment endoscopies were performed, and the findings were scored and recorded. The gastric fluid was aspirated at each time and prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2 and leukotriene B4 were determined by ELISA. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the primary efficacy. Changes in endoscopic findings by means of Lanza score showed statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in favour of meloxicam at all sites--gastric, duodenal and total. Within-group comparisons showed a statistically significant difference (worsening) in gastric and total score with piroxicam, but no significant difference with meloxicam. The frequency of clinically relevant cases (total score >2) also showed a statistically significant worsening in the piroxicam group. The better GI tolerability of meloxicam was also suggested by fewer adverse GI events and no withdrawals due to adverse events compared with piroxicam. The pre-/post-study gastric juice concentration of PGE2, TXB2, and LTB4 in the meloxicam group was 135.2 +/- 85.8/71.2 +/- 32.2, 116.3 +/- 81.7/99.4 +/- 107.5 and 388 +/- 321/223 +/- 98 pg/ml respectively.

It is characterized by acute, extensive formation of nonfollicular sterile pustules on erythematous background, fever, and peripheral blood leukocytosis. We present clinical and immunological data on four patients with this disease, which is caused by different drugs. An involvement of T cells could be implied by positive skin patch tests and lymphocyte transformation tests. Immunohistochemistry revealed a massive cell infiltrate consisting of neutrophils in pustules and T cells in the dermis and epidermis. Expression of the potent neutrophil-attracting chemokine IL-8 was elevated in keratinocytes and infiltrating mononuclear cells. Drug-specific T cells were generated from the blood and skin of three patients, and phenotypic characterization showed a heterogeneous distribution of CD4/CD8 phenotype and of T-cell receptor Vbeta-expression. Analysis of cytokine/chemokine profiles revealed that IL-8 is produced significantly more by drug-specific T cells from patients with AGEP compared with drug-specific T cells from patients that had non-AGEP exanthemas. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the involvement of drug-specific T cells in the pathomechanism of this rather rare and peculiar form of drug allergy. In addition, they indicate that even in some neutrophil-rich inflammatory responses specific T cells are engaged and might orchestrate the immune reaction.",E,E

When the dominant follicle reached 14-16 mm in diameter, 25 mg rofecoxib or placebo was taken orally, once daily for 9 consecutive days, during which follicle size was monitored daily by ultrasound scans and serial hormone analyses were performed.; Four of the six women who received rofecoxib demonstrated delayed follicle rupture, >48 h after the LH peak, when compared with the placebo group, who all had follicular rupture >36 h after the detected LH peak. No differences in peripheral serum concentrations of progesterone, oestradiol, LH and FSH were observed between placebo and rofecoxib groups, when analysed at specified time intervals.; This study suggests that selective COX-2 inhibition has a negative, local effect on human ovulation, resulting in delayed follicular rupture, without affecting peripheral hormonal cyclicity.",4,E

There is no agreement, however, on whether all conventional NSAIDs have a similar relative risk (RR), and epidemiologic data are limited on acetaminophen. We studied the association between these medications and the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleed/perforation in a population-based cohort of 958,397 persons in the United Kingdom between 1993 and 1998. Our nested case-control analysis included 2,105 cases and 11,500 controls. RR estimates were adjusted for several factors known to be associated with upper gastrointestinal bleed/perforation. Compared with non-users, users of acetaminophen at doses less than 2 gm did not have an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal complications. The adjusted RR for acetaminophen at doses greater than 2 gm was 3.6 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 2.6-5.1]. The corresponding RRs for low/medium and high doses of NSAIDs were 2.4 (95% CI = 1.9-3.1) and 4.9 (95% CI = 4.1-5.8).

However, by decreasing vasodilatory and antiaggregatory prostacyclin production, COX-2 antagonists may lead to increased prothrombotic activity. To define the cardiovascular effects of COX-2 inhibitors when used for arthritis and musculoskeletal pain in patients without coronary artery disease, we performed a MEDLINE search to identify all English-language articles on use of COX-2 inhibitors published between 1998 and February 2001. We also reviewed relevant submissions to the US Food and Drug Administration by pharmaceutical companies. Our search yielded 2 major randomized trials, the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research Study (VIGOR; 8076 patients) and the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS; 8059 patients), as well as 2 smaller trials with approximately 1000 patients each. The results from VIGOR showed that the relative risk of developing a confirmed adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cardiac thrombus, resuscitated cardiac arrest, sudden or unexplained death, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attacks) with rofecoxib treatment compared with naproxen was 2.38 (95% confidence interval, 1.39-4.00; P =.002). There was no significant difference in cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) rates between celecoxib and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in CLASS. The annualized myocardial infarction rates for COX-2 inhibitors in both VIGOR and CLASS were significantly higher than that in the placebo group of a recent meta-analysis of 23 407 patients in primary prevention trials (0.52%): 0.74% with rofecoxib (P =.04 compared with the placebo group of the meta-analysis) and 0.80% with celecoxib (P =.02 compared with the placebo group of the meta-analysis). The available data raise a cautionary flag about the risk of cardiovascular events with COX-2 inhibitors. Further prospective trial evaluation may characterize and determine the magnitude of the risk.",I,8

Analyses were also performed using pooled results of two 12-week endoscopic surveillance trials, with adjustments for silent ulcers of 40% and 85%.; Under base-case conditions, the expected cost savings in GI problems and comedications averted with rofecoxib versus NSAIDs was 0.81 dollars per day, representing an 85% offset of the difference in drug price. For rofecoxib versus NSAIDs, the expected cost per PUB avoided with rofecoxib was 4738 dollars, and expected cost per year of life saved was 18,614 dollars. In analyses based on endoscopic data, therapy with rofecoxib was less expensive than therapy with NSAIDs, regardless of silent ulcer adjustment. Results were most sensitive to prophylactic GI comedication rates, and were robust over a range of model assumptions and costs.; In this analysis based on differences in clinically significant GI events for osteoarthritis patients, cost differences between rofecoxib and NSAIDs were markedly offset by expected cost savings in GI problems and comedications averted with rofecoxib. Costs per year of life saved with rofecoxib versus NSAIDs were well within accepted benchmarks for cost-effectiveness. When endoscopic data alone were considered, rofecoxib was cost saving across all assumptions about silent ulcer rates.",I,5

J. Pharmacol. 126 (1999) 1824.]. Here, we have extended these studies to humans. Healthy male volunteers were given orally one of the following drugs (mg) for 5 days: etodolac (200 or 400 b.i.d.), meloxicam (7.5 or 15 q.d.), nimesulide (100 or 200 b.i.d.), nabumetone (500 or 1000 b.i.d.) or naproxen (500 b.i.d.). Blood samples were withdrawn from the volunteers before and up to 24 h after the last dose. Plasma obtained from the blood was tested for its ability to inhibit prostanoid formation in interleukin-1beta-treated A549 cells (cyclooxygenase-2 system) and human washed platelets (cyclooxygenase-1 system). Plasma from etodolac-treated subjects demonstrated a slight selectivity towards the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2. This effect was more prominent in plasma from subjects receiving meloxicam or nimesulide. Plasma from nabumetone-treated subjects showed no or little selectivity towards cyclooxygenase-1 depending on the dose of drug administered, while plasma taken from subjects receiving naproxen was more active at inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 than cyclooxygenase-2. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that this assay can be used to assess ex vivo the relative activity against cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 of NSAIDs consumed by human volunteers. It is to be hoped that data from such systems will aid in our understanding of the relationships between the differential inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 by NSAIDs and their reported efficacies and (gastrointestinal) toxicities.",4,E

Our objective was to compare the effect on gastrointestinal permeability of acute equieffective doses of four different NSAIDs; three were designed to reduce gastrointestinal mucosal injury.; Healthy volunteers underwent sugar tests in a randomised fashion, 15 days apart, at: (1) baseline; (2) after two days of 75 mg slow release (microspheres) indomethacin; (3) after two days of 7.5 mg oral meloxicam which preferentially inhibits cyclooxygenase 2; and (4) after two days of 750 mg naproxen. A subgroup of subjects was tested after two days of 200 mg celecoxib. In each test, subjects ingested a solution containing sucrose, lactulose, and mannitol and sucralose, to evaluate gastroduodenal, intestinal, and colonic permeability, respectively.; Gastric permeability was significantly affected by naproxen (p<0.05) but not by slow release indomethacin, meloxicam, or celecoxib. Intestinal permeability was significantly increased by the first three NSAIDs (p<0.05) but not by celecoxib. Abnormal lactulose/mannitol ratios were observed in 42% of meloxicam treatments, in 62% during indomethacin, and in 75% of subjects treated with naproxen. Finally, colonic permeability, as measured by sucralose, was not significantly increased by any of the four drugs.; Our study provides evidence that the newly developed NSAIDs reduce gastric mucosal permeability significantly. However, most produced significant alteration of small intestinal permeability. In contrast, our results suggest that celecoxib seems to exhibit the most desirable gastrointestinal side effect profile.",4,E

Among the randomized, controlled trials with the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib, one study demonstrated a significant difference between rofecoxib and its NSAID comparator (naproxen) in the risk of CV thrombotic events. A combined analysis of individual patient data was undertaken to determine whether there was an excess of CV thrombotic events in patients treated with rofecoxib compared with those treated with placebo or nonselective NSAIDs.; CV thrombotic events were assessed across 23 phase IIb to V rofecoxib studies. Comparisons were made between patients taking rofecoxib and those taking either placebo, naproxen (an NSAID with near-complete inhibition of platelet function throughout its dosing interval), or another nonselective NSAIDs used in the development program (diclofenac, ibuprofen, and nabumetone). The major outcome measure was the combined end point used by the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration, which includes CV, hemorrhagic, and unknown deaths; nonfatal myocardial infarctions; and nonfatal strokes. More than 28 000 patients, representing >14 000 patient-years at risk, were analyzed. The relative risk for an end point was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.38) when comparing rofecoxib with placebo; 0.79 (95% CI: 0.40, 1.55) when comparing rofecoxib with non-naproxen NSAIDs; and 1.69 (95% CI: 1.07, 2.69) when comparing rofecoxib with naproxen.; This analysis provides no evidence for an excess of CV events for rofecoxib relative to either placebo or the non-naproxen NSAIDs that were studied. Differences observed between rofecoxib and naproxen are likely the result of the antiplatelet effects of the latter agent.",I,8

(2) The clinical file on celecoxib, a drug promoted as a selective COX-2 inhibitor, is bulky but fails to answer several practical questions, mainly because it lacks comparative trials against paracetamol and low-dose NSAIDs. (3) In osteoarthritis, three double-blind trials versus naproxen and placebo in a total of 3 258 patients show that the analgesic effect of celecoxib 200 mg/day is moderate and does not differ significantly from that of naproxen. Giving celecoxib in one or two daily doses makes no difference in terms of efficacy. (4) In rheumatoid arthritis, two double-blind trials against naproxen and placebo in a total of 2252 patients, and a double-blind trial versus sustained-release diclofenac, show that the symptomatic effect of celecoxib is moderate and no different from that of the comparator NSAIDs. (5) There is no evidence that the safety profile of celecoxib is very different from that of other NSAIDs. The advantage in terms of gastrointestinal adverse effects appears very slight. According to clinical trials and pharmacovigilance data, celecoxib is in no way exempt from the severe gastrointestinal adverse effects generally associated with NSAIDs.

This concern stemmed from observations indicating that the COX-2 isoform is the major source of endothelium-derived prostacyclin and, hence, that selective blockade of this enzyme may impair endothelial health. To investigate this matter, we examined the effects of 7 days of treatment with rofecoxib versus naproxen on endothelial function in healthy volunteers.; Thirty-five healthy volunteers were randomized to receive 7-day treatment with either rofecoxib (25 mg/d, n=18) or naproxen (750 mg/d, n=17). Vascular response measurements were conducted using forearm strain-gauge plethysmography. Changes in forearm blood flow in response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (3, 10, and 30 microg/min) and the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (1 and 10 microg/min) were assessed before and after treatment. Acetylcholine evoked a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow in all groups. Importantly, treatment resulted in no change in acetylcholine-mediated increases in forearm blood flow in either group (naproxen, P=0.27; rofecoxib, P=0.58). Similarly, there was no change in forearm blood flow in response to sodium nitroprusside (naproxen, P=0.55; rofecoxib, P=0.63).; We herein describe, for the first time, the effects of COX-2-selective inhibition on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in healthy adults. COX-2 blockade, when used at the doses employed therapeutically (which are known to inhibit vascular prostacyclin production) did not result in significant changes in endothelial vasodilator responses in healthy volunteers.

Some investigators have suggested that the preemptive administration of NSAIDs may reduce postoperative analgesic requirements and hypersensitivity. We evaluated the analgesic effect of administering rofecoxib either before or after surgical incision in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery under local anesthesia. Sixty patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscectomy were randomized into three groups. All patients received intraarticular bupivacaine 0.25% pre- and postsurgery together with IV sedation using midazolam and propofol. The Preincisional group received a single 50 mg dose of rofecoxib 1 h before surgery, the Postincisional group received rofecoxib 50 mg after the completion of surgery, and the Placebo group received a placebo tablet before surgery. Pain scores, the time to first opioid use, and 24-h analgesic use were recorded. Analgesic duration, defined as the time from completion of surgery until first opioid use, was significantly longer in those patients receiving pre- (803 +/- 536 min) versus postincisional (461 +/- 344 min) rofecoxib or placebo (318 +/- 108 min). The 24 h acetaminophen/oxycodone use was less in the Preincisional group (1.5 +/- 0.6 pills) versus the Postincisional group (3.3 +/- 1.3 pills) or the Placebo group (5.5 +/- 1.6 pills). Pain scores with movement were lower in the Preincisional group at all postoperative time intervals. We conclude that rofecoxib provides effective postoperative analgesia for arthroscopic meniscectomy. Further, the administration of rofecoxib 50 mg before surgery provides a longer duration of postoperative analgesia, less 24 h opioid use, and lower incidental pain scores compared with administering the drug after the completion of surgery.; The administration of rofecoxib 50 mg before arthroscopic knee surgery provides a longer duration of analgesia, less 24-h opioid use, and lower pain scores than administering the drug after the completion of surgery.",4,E

Valdecoxib is a new, highly selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitor with a rapid onset of action and significant analgesic properties that is being developed for the management of acute pain. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the opioid-sparing efficacy of valdecoxib as part of a multimodal treatment of pain associated with hip arthroplasty. This multicenter, multiple-dose, double-blind, parallel-group study compared the opioid-sparing effects, analgesic efficacy, and safety of 20- and 40-mg doses of valdecoxib twice daily with placebo in patients receiving morphine by patient-controlled analgesia after hip arthroplasty. Study medication was first administered 1 to 3 hours preoperatively. The total amount of morphine administered, pain intensity, and patient's global evaluation of study medication were assessed over a period of 48 hours. Patients receiving 20 or 40 mg valdecoxib twice daily required on average 40% less morphine than those receiving placebo after hip arthroplasty. Pain intensity levels and patient satisfaction were significantly improved in both valdecoxib groups compared with placebo. Valdecoxib and placebo were equally well tolerated. Pre- and postoperative administration of valdecoxib reduces the amount of morphine required for postoperative pain relief and provides greater analgesic efficacy compared with morphine alone. Thus, valdecoxib has significant clinical utility for acute pain management in orthopedic surgery patients.",E,E

The median treatment exposure was 31/2 months. The primary end point assessed was the risk of any arterial or venous thrombotic cardiovascular adverse event (AE). A second analysis assessed differences in the Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaboration (APTC) events, a cluster end point that consists of the combined incidence of (1) cardiovascular, hemorrhagic, and unknown death; (2) myocardial infarction; and (3) cerebrovascular accident. Similar rates of thrombotic cardiovascular AEs were reported with rofecoxib, placebo, and comparator nonselective NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, or nabumetone). In trials that compared rofecoxib with NSAIDs, the incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular AEs was 1.93/100 patient-years in the rofecoxib treatment group compared with 2.27/100 patient-years in the combined nonselective NSAID group. In trials that compared rofecoxib with placebo, the incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular AEs was 2.71/100 patient-years in the rofecoxib group compared with 2.57/100 patient-years in the placebo group. Consistent with the risks of cardiovascular AEs, similar rates of APTC events were reported with rofecoxib, placebo, and comparator nonselective NSAIDs. Thus, in the rofecoxib osteoarthritis development program, there was no difference between rofecoxib, comparator nonselective NSAIDs, and placebo in the risks of cardiovascular thrombotic events.",I,8

Patients were randomized to receive placebo, 200 microg of misoprostol 4 times a day, or 15 or 30 mg of lansoprazole once daily for 12 weeks. Ulcer status was determined by endoscopy at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.; Patients receiving lansoprazole (15 or 30 mg) remained free from gastric ulcer longer than those who received placebo (P<.001) but for a shorter time than those who received misoprostol. By week 12, the percentages of gastric ulcer-free patients were as follows: placebo, 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.1%-61.3%); misoprostol, 93% (95% CI, 87.2%-97.9%); 15-mg lansoprazole, 80% (95% CI, 72.5%-87.3%); and 30-mg lansoprazole, 82% (95% CI, 75.0%-89.6%). A significantly higher proportion of patients in the misoprostol group reported treatment-related adverse events and early withdrawal from the study. When the impact of withdrawals on ulcer development was considered (as failures), therapy was successful for 69% for each of the active treatment groups and 35% for the placebo group.; Proton pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole are superior to placebo for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers but not superior to misoprostol, 800 microg/d. When the poor compliance and potential adverse effects associated with misoprostol are considered, proton pump inhibitors and full-dose misoprostol are clinically equivalent.",I,I

The pain associated with OA is the primary symptom leading to disability in these patients. Current ACR guidelines recommend consideration of acetaminophen for mild-to-moderate pain and conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX-2 specific inhibitors for moderate-to-severe OA symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the COX-1 sparing, COX-2 specific inhibitor, celecoxib, with the conventional NSAID naproxen, and placebo, in the treatment of OA of the hip. In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 1061 patients with symptomatic OA of the hip were randomized to receive celecoxib at doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg/day; naproxen 1000 mg/day; or placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated using standard measures of efficacy at baseline, 2-4 days after discontinuing previous NSAID or analgesic therapy, and after 2, 6, and 12 weeks of treatment. All doses of celecoxib and naproxen significantly improved the symptoms of OA, at all time points compared with placebo. This sustained treatment effect of celecoxib was dose dependent. In terms of pain relief and improvement in functional capacity, celecoxib 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day were similarly efficacious and were comparable to naproxen. Both drugs were generally well tolerated. Celecoxib at a dose of 200 mg/day is as effective as a standard therapeutic dose of the conventional NSAID, naproxen, in reducing the pain associated with OA of the hip.",I,I

Comparison of the NANSAID rofexocib with naproxen showed a substantial difference in acute myocardial infarction risk, which has been interpreted as a protective effect of naproxen. We did an observational study to measure the effects of NANSAIDs, including naproxen, on risk of serious coronary heart disease.; We used data from the Tennessee Medicaid programme obtained between Jan 1, 1987, and Dec 31, 1998, to identify a cohort of new NANSAID users (n=181 441) and an equal number of non-users, matched for age, sex, and date NANSAID use began. Both groups were 50-84 years of age, were not resident in a nursing home, and did not have life-threatening illness. The study endpoint was hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease.; During 532634 person-years of follow-up, 6362 cases of serious coronary heart disease occurred, or 11.9 per 1000 person-years. Multivariate-adjusted rate ratios for current and former use of NANSAIDs were 1.05 (95% CI 0.97-1.14) and 1.02 (0.97-1.08), respectively.

There was no protection among long-term NANSAID users with uninterrupted use; the rate ratio among current users with more than 60 days of continuous use was 1.05 (0.91-1.21). When naproxen was directly compared with ibuprofen, the current-use rate ratio was 0.83 (0.69-0.98).; Absence of a protective effect of naproxen or other NANSAIDs on risk of coronary heart disease suggests that these drugs should not be used for cardioprotection.",E,E

Aspirin, a nonselective COX-1 (cyclo-oxygenase) and COX-2 inhibitor may result in gastric toxicity. For this reason, selective COX-2 inhibitors have been developed to reduce erosion of the gastric mucosa. Both selective and nonselective NSAIDs reduce prostacyclin formation in the infarcted heart; they accomplish this by tipping the balance of prostacyclin/thromboxane in favor of thromboxane, a prothrombotic eicosanoid. The relative increase in thromboxane, coupled with a diminution in prostacyclin in infarcted heart muscle, can lead to the development of thrombotic cardiovascular events. This may be prevented by the addition of a nitric oxide donor to NSAIDs.",E,E

Thus, we analyzed the data for celecoxib and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) from the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study to determine the incidences of serious CV thromboembolic events. This trial included 3,987 persons randomized to celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (2,320 person-years of exposure) and 3,981 persons randomized to either ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (2,203 person-years). Because acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) use for CV risk prophylaxis (< or =325 mg/day) was permitted, separate analyses were performed for all patients and those not taking ASA. The incidences of serious CV thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, CV deaths, and peripheral events) were similar, and not significantly different, between celecoxib and NSAID comparators (combined or individually) for all patients as well as the subgroup of patients not taking ASA. This observation was true both for all serious CV thromboembolic events, as well as for individual events. No increase in myocardial infarction was apparent, even in patients not taking ASA who were candidates for secondary prophylaxis for myocardial infarction. The relative risks for celecoxib versus NSAIDs for serious CV thromboembolic events were 1.1 for all patients and 1.1 for the subgroup of patients not taking ASA (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.6 and 0.6 to 1.9, respectively). In addition, the incidences of adverse CV events such as hypertension, edema, and congestive heart failure were similar to, or significantly lower than, NSAID comparators regardless of the use of ASA. Thus, these analyses demonstrate no increased risk of serious CV thromboembolic events associated with celecoxib compared with conventional NSAIDs and therefore do not support the hypothesis of a class adverse effect of cyclooxygenase 2 specific inhibitors on the CV system.",I,8

Inhibition of blood COX isoenzymes was determined in vitro before any drug intake and ex vivo after single and repeated intake of either 7.5 mg meloxicam once, 400 mg ibuprofen three times daily or 75 mg diclofenac SR once, taken in a randomized cross-over design. Production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) during clotting and of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) during endotoxin exposure served as indicators of platelet COX-1 and monocyte COX-2 activity, respectively. Drugs were determined in plasma by h.p.l.c., with a chiral separation of ibuprofen and free fractions after equilibrium dialysis.; Intra-subject variation for COX-1 and COX-2 at baseline was at 26 +/- 18% and 18 +/- 13% respectively, and intersubject variation at 39% and 36%, respectively. The ratios of IC50s and, at best, of IC80s revealed diclofenac and meloxicam as selective COX-2 inhibitors and ibuprofen as a preferential COX-1 inhibitor in vitro. However, after oral intake, ibuprofen inhibited ex vivo COX-2 by 80% whereas diclofenac inhibited COX-1 by 70%. Meloxicam inhibited COX-1 from 30 to 55% depending on the repetition of the dose and increase in plasma concentrations. Using in vitro dose--response curves, the in vivo inhibitory potency of diclofenac was estimated adequately from its circulating concentration ([-0.18, 0.21] for COX-1 and [-0.13, -0.03] for COX-2) but this was not the case for ibuprofen on COX-2 ([-0.14, 0.27]) and meloxicam on COX-1 ([0.31, 1.05]). The limited predictability of the system was not improved through considering the unbound fraction of the drugs or the variable chiral inversion of ibuprofen.; Assessment of COX-2 selectivity based on in vitro studies and pharmacological modelling has a limited clinical relevance.

The synthesis of selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors has been an important breakthrough in antiinflammatory therapy by decreasing the incidence of upper gastrointestinal lesions. However, there is little information available concerning their effects on gut mucosa distally to the duodenum. A case history is described of a 52-year-old woman with a temporary colostomy after resection of a sigmoid tumor and who presented with bloody diarrhea 5 days after beginning therapy with rofecoxib. The hemorrhage had its origin in the transverse colon, and the endoscopic appearance was that of actively bleeding acute hemorrhagic colitis. No other colonic lesions were detected, nor was there any evidence of related infection, bleeding diathesis, or other systemic diseases. On discontinuing rofecoxib and instituting parenteral rehydration, the bleeding and diarrhea stopped. Endoscopic follow-up revealed regenerating mucosa in the transverse colon. The time relation, the absence of other causes of hemorrhage, and the clinical evolution all strongly support the probability of a causal relation between rofecoxib and hemorrhagic colitis.

But this risk was confined to PPI (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.95, 5.69), and not to other GI drugs. Overall, patients using nonselective NSAID compared to those taking COX-2-specific inhibitors had an increased risk of upper GI ulcers (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.43, 3.34). Patients taking nonselective NSAID plus PPI were also at increased risk for upper GI ulcers compared to those taking nonselective NSAID alone (OR 5.09. 95% CI 3.88, 6.67). Similarly, the risk of upper GI ulcers was increased in the nonselective NSAID plus PPI group (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.32, 6.31) compared to the COX-2 plus PPI group.; PPI use, but not other GI drug use, is a marker for increased susceptibility to ulcers among NSAID users. This risk of upper GI ulcers is increased in PPI users regardless of which NSAID is used (nonselective or COX-2-specific inhibitor). Although COX-2 use is associated with greater risk factors for upper GI ulcers due to channeling bias, COX-2 users have significantly fewer ulcers than equivalent nonselective NSAID users regardless of concomitant PPI utilization.",E,E

Patients received either two doses of rofecoxib 50 mg or a placebo preoperatively. The outcome measures included morphine use in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), discharge times, and side effect profile. Data were analyzed by use of independent sample t tests for continuous variables or chi(2) tests for categorical variables. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.; The two groups were comparable with respect to patient characteristics, intraoperative opioid and hypnotic consumption, and duration of surgery. Patients in the rofecoxib group required significantly less morphine postoperatively. Significantly more patients in the placebo group reported pain scores greater than 7 at admission to the PACU. Time to first request for analgesia was shorter in the placebo group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. There were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of nausea, time to discharge from the PACU, or hospital stay.; Preoperative rofecoxib is effective in reducing postoperative narcotic consumption in patients undergoing lumbar laminectomy.

Less is known about the specific cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors now widely used for the treatment of arthritis. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of celecoxib compared with placebo on 24-hour BP levels in ACE inhibitor-treated patients with hypertension. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial involving 178 men and women (mean age, 53 years) with essential hypertension who were treated and controlled with lisinopril monotherapy (10 to 40 mg daily). Baseline BP values were obtained using 24-hour ambulatory recordings. Patients received either celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily (twice the recommended dose for osteoarthritis) (n=91), or placebo (n=87) for 4 weeks, and changes in the 24-hour BP, body weight, and clinical laboratory parameters were assessed. Mean changes from baseline in the 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP were 2.6/1.5+/-0.9/0.6 mm Hg on celecoxib versus 1.0/0.3+/-1/0.6 mm Hg on placebo (P=0.34 for systolic BP; P=0.45 for diastolic BP). The proportion of patients whose 24-hour BP increased by at least 5, 10, 15, or 20 mm Hg were also similar on celecoxib and placebo. No changes in body weight, serum creatinine, or potassium occurred in either group. Thus, these data demonstrate that high doses of celecoxib have no significant effect on the antihypertensive effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril.

In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we examined the effects of acetaminophen and a cyclooxygenase type-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, when administered alone or in combination, before elective otolaryngologic surgery in 112 healthy outpatients. Subjects were assigned to 1 of 4 study groups: Group 1, placebo (vitamin C, 500 mg per os [PO]); Group 2, acetaminophen 2000 mg PO; Group 3, celecoxib 200 mg PO; or Group 4, acetaminophen 2000 mg and celecoxib 200 mg PO. All patients received a standardized anesthetic technique. During the postoperative period, pain was assessed using a 10-point verbal rating scale. Recovery times, the need for rescue analgesics, side effects, and patient satisfaction scores were also recorded. The combination of acetaminophen and celecoxib was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing postoperative pain. Celecoxib, when administered alone or in combination with acetaminophen, improved patients' satisfaction with their postoperative analgesia.

Recent evidence suggests that the primary inflammation occurs in a maxillary nerve segment, accessible intraorally. Local tenderness, related to symptom laterality, has been palpated consistently in asymptomatic migraine patients, and significant migraine relief has been obtained from chilling confined to this area. Thirty-five symptomatic episodic migraine patients were enrolled in this study, comparing 40 minutes of bilateral intraoral chilling, 50 mg of oral sumatriptan, and 40 minutes of sham (tongue) chilling. Hollow metal tubes chilled by circulating ice water were held in the maxillary molar periapical areas by the patient. Pain and nausea were recorded at baseline and 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours after start of treatment, using a numeric symptom-relief scale. Significant mean headache relief was obtained by maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at all four time intervals, with poor relief obtained by placebo. Maxillary chilling was more effective than sumatriptan at all four time intervals. Significant nausea relief was obtained by maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at posttreatment and 2 and 4 hours later. At 24 hours, some headache and nausea recurrence was noted with sumatriptan. The repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that both treatments, drug (P = 0.024) and maxillary chilling (P = 0.001), reduced the headache, as compared with the control group. Tenderness suggests local inflammation associated with vasodilatation and edema. Because chilling can resolve local edema, these findings raise the possibility that an intraoral inflammation may be a factor in migraine etiology.",E,E

Diclofenac sodium is the most commonly prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug worldwide; it is effective for the treatment of pain as well as the signs and symptoms associated with the painful conditions of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.; The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg, 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg, and placebo over 8-hour and 24-hour periods in patients with moderate to severe pain after oral surgery.; In this double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, parallel-group study, patients experiencing moderate to severe pain after the surgical extraction of > or = 2 third molars were randomized to receive a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg, 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (50 mg given every 8 hours), or placebo. Patients rated pain intensity, pain relief, and global assessments at prespecified times throughout the 24-hour period after initial dosing. Overall analgesic efficacy was determined by total pain relief over 8 hours (TOPAR8) and 24 hours (TOPAR24) and patient global assessments at 8 and 24 hours. Onset of analgesic effect was determined by using the 2-stopwatch method for confirmed perceptible pain relief. Peak analgesic effect was the maximum pain relief attained during the first 8 hours. The duration of analgesic effect was determined by median time to rescue analgesia use.; A total of 305 patients were randomized to treatment: 121 received rofecoxib, 121 received diclofenac sodium, and 63 received placebo. The baseline demographics were similar among the groups. Overall, 61.3% experienced moderate pain and 38.7% experienced severe pain; 53.1% were female; and the mean age was 23.4 years. The overall analgesic efficacy, as assessed by TOPAR8, of a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg was significantly greater than a single dose of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (20.5 vs 8.2) and placebo (20.5 vs 5.9). Patient global assessment at 8 hours was also significantly better for rofecoxib compared with enteric-coated diclofenac sodium and placebo. TOPAR24 was significantly greater for a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg compared with 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (64.1 vs 25.1) and placebo (64.1 vs 19.2). At 24 hours, the patient global assessment for rofecoxib was significantly better than that achieved with enteric-coated diclofenac sodium and placebo. The onset of analgesic effect was significantly more rapid for rofecoxib than for enteric-coated diclofenac sodium and placebo (median times: 31 minutes, >4 hours, and >4 hours, respectively). The peak analgesic effect was significantly greater for rofecoxib compared with enteric-coated diclofenac sodium (3.2 vs 1.5) and placebo (3.2 vs 1.1). The duration of analgesia was significantly longer for rofecoxib than enteric-coated diclofenac sodium (median times: >24 hours vs 1 hour and 37 minutes) and placebo (>24 hours vs 1 hour and 37 minutes). Enteric-coated diclofenac sodium was numerically greater than placebo for the key end points measuring overall efficacy (total pain relief and patient global assessment), but diclofenac sodium did not provide as much analgesic effect as expected for a drug effective for pain, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis and did not differ significantly from placebo. Overall, both rofecoxib and enteric-coated diclofenac sodium were generally well tolerated, although the rofecoxib group had a significantly lower incidence of clinical and drug-related adverse events than the enteric-coated diclofenac sodium group.; A single 50-mg dose of rofecoxib provided greater overall analgesic efficacy over 8 hours, more rapid onset of analgesia, greater maximum analgesic effect, and longer duration of effect than a single 50-mg dose of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium in patients with moderate to severe pain associated with oral surgery. Compared with 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (50 mg every 8 hours), a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg provided greater overall analgesic efficacy over 24 hours.",4,E

This in turn can lead to unreliable conclusions about treatment effectiveness. Although widely acknowledged as important, no studies in rheumatology have measured the extent of these biases. We identified variables contributing to confounding and investigated the strength of the confounding effect. Analytical methods (propensity scores) are available to mitigate the effect of nonrandom assignment if the full extent of confounding can be understood.; A population of 6637 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) from the practices of 433 US rheumatologists completed 2 sets of detailed questionnaires concerning (1) the last 6 months in 1998 and (2) the first 6 months of 1999, generally prior to and after the release of celecoxib and rofecoxib. Patients who received the COX-2 specific inhibitors in period 2 were identified (n = 1517), and their characteristics were compared to the 5120 who did not start a new COX-2 specific inhibitor during Period 1.; Patients starting a new COX-2 specific inhibitor had a greater lifetime history of adverse reactions of all kinds, but particularly gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. They also had more severe scores for pain, functional disability, fatigue, helplessness, and global severity, and they used more inpatient and outpatients services than patients who would not switch to COX-2 specific inhibitors.; Confounding by indication and channeling bias result in an overall increase in severity of about 25% for the above measures. Observational studies should account for these biases by a broadly defined propensity score that includes the variables identified in this report. These observations are germane to observational studies of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics, as well, and suggest the need for careful control of confounders when assessing treatment effects in rheumatic disease observational studies.",E,E

The primary efficacy assessment was 'Throat Pain on Swallowing' on day 3. In addition, secondary quality-of-life assessments were performed on days 3 and 5. All adverse events and treatment-emergent signs and symptoms were recorded. Data from 313 patients were evaluable for efficacy (105 celecoxib 200 mg once daily, 107 celecoxib 200 mg twice daily, 101 diclofenac 75 mg twice daily). The upper 95% confidence limits for the visual analog scale of 'Throat Pain on Swallowing' on day 3 for celecoxib 200 mg once daily relative to diclofenac 75 mg twice daily, and celecoxib 200 mg twice daily relative to diclofenac 75 mg twice daily were 9.26 and 7.83, respectively. All secondary efficacy and quality-of-life measures were clinically similar for the three treatment groups, and no statistically significant differences were detected. The incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events were similar for all groups, but numerically higher among patients taking diclofenac than celecoxib. More patients in the diclofenac group reported gastrointestinal complaints (7.3%) compared with those in the celecoxib groups (4.3% in the celecoxib 200 mg once-daily group and 3.4% in the celecoxib 200 mg twice-daily group). In conclusion, 5 days of treatment with celecoxib 200 mg once daily is as effective as diclofenac 75 mg twice daily in the symptomatic treatment of viral pharyngitis. Celecoxib 200 mg once daily is also as effective as celecoxib 200 mg twice daily in this condition.",4,E

However, important findings such as high levels of activating cytokines in the CSF and signs of CNS inflammation have been controversial. The authors conducted a trial of the new selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib, an immunomodulatory drug, in schizophrenic patients to evaluate its therapeutic effects.; In a prospective, double-blind evaluation, 50 patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were randomly assigned to either risperidone plus celecoxib or risperidone plus placebo. After a washout period, 25 patients received 2-6 mg/day of risperidone plus placebo and 25 received risperidone plus 400 mg/day of celecoxib for 5 weeks. The treatment effect was calculated by analysis of covariance. There were no significant differences between groups in age, sex, duration or severity of disease or psychopathology, or risperidone dose or plasma level.; Over 5 weeks, both groups of patients showed significant improvement in scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and on all subscales. However, the celecoxib group showed significantly greater improvement in the total score.; Additional treatment with celecoxib has significant positive effects on the therapeutic action of risperidone with regard to total schizophrenia psychopathology. Moreover, the fact that treatment with an immunomodulatory drug showed beneficial effects on schizophrenia symptoms indicates that immune dysfunction in schizophrenia is not just an epiphenomenon but is related to the pathomechanism of the disorder. However, a nonimmunological therapeutic effect of celecoxib mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor has to be taken into account.",4,E

She presented with clinical findings of subnephrotic proteinuria and acute renal failure that required dialysis. She recovered renal function with cessation of celecoxib therapy after 2 weeks. Other medications were reintroduced safely, without recurrence of renal failure. A kidney biopsy specimen showed acute interstitial nephritis with a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate in the interstitium.

After a second 2 week wash-out period, one dose of indomethacin 50 mg was given as a positive control to check for NSAID induced inhibition of platelet function. COX-1 inhibition was measured as percentage inhibition of serum TXB2 generation in clotting whole blood, and as closure time with use of the platelet function analyser PFA-100. Data are reported as median with range. Paired variables were analysed using Wilcoxons signed rank test.; TXB2 levels decreased significantly after all three medications, but percentage inhibition after nabumetone and indomethacin (88% and 97%, respectively) was significantly higher than after meloxicam (63%) (P<0.05). Closure times increased significantly after administration of all three medications (P<0.05). Increases in closure time after administration did not differ between nabumetone and meloxicam (24% and 14%, respectively), but were significantly larger after indomethacin administration (63%) (P<0.01).; In the maximum registered dosage, nabumetone inhibits thromboxane production much more than meloxicam, signifying less COX-2 selectivity of the former. However, both nabumetone and meloxicam cause only minor impairment in platelet function in comparison with indomethacin and the difference between them is not significant.",4,E

The nephrotoxic potential of selective COX-2 inhibitors has not been clearly established. This study was conducted in order to understand the association between acute renal failure and the two COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib.; A search was performed in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) to identify cases of renal failure submitted to the FDA. A MEDLINE search of the English language literature was also performed to identify published cases of renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib.; One hundred twenty-two and 142 domestic US cases of celecoxib and rofecoxib-associated renal failure, respectively, were identified in the AERS database. The literature search identified 19 cases of acute renal impairment in association with celecoxib and rofecoxib. In addition, drug regulatory authorities in the UK, Canada, and Australia have received about 50 reports of renal failure with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Descriptive statistics of the AERS cases have been summarised in this report.; Data from AERS and published case reports suggest that use of both these drugs is associated with renal effects similar to that of conventional nonselective NSAIDs. Physicians should be aware that serious or life-threatening renal failure has been reported in patients with normal or impaired renal function after short-term therapy with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Patients at greatest risk for renal injury are those with pre-existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and/or ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Kidney function should be monitored closely for any signs of potential renal injuries soon after initiating treatment with these agents, especially in high-risk populations. In addition, healthcare practitioners should adequately warn patients of the signs and symptoms of serious renal toxicity, and of the need for them to see their physician promptly if they occur. Celecoxib and rofecoxib are not recommended for use in patients with advanced renal disease.",E,E

Platelet aggregation responses (to arachidonate [AA], collagen, and adenosine diphosphate [ADP]), bleeding time, and serum thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) concentrations were measured at baseline and at regular intervals on days 1 and 8. Valdecoxib had no effect on platelet function. Naproxen and diclofenac significantly reduced the platelet aggregation response to AA and to a lesser extent collagen and ADP at most assessments compared with placebo. Naproxen significantly lowered serum TxB(2) levels. In contrast to standard doses of 2 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), a supratherapeutic valdecoxib dosage does not impair platelet function (COX-1).

As with any other acute treatment for migraine, headache recurrence may occur in up to one-third of responders. Combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to reduce the incidence of headache recurrence in clinical practice. Rofecoxib is a member of a new class of NSAIDs, which selectively inhibits the COX-2 enzyme and therefore is associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal side-effects; the drug has a long plasma half-life (17 h). This open label study compared rizatriptan with rizatriptan plus rofecoxib in the acute treatment of migraine. Fifty-six triptan naive patients from a tertiary centre (37 women and 19 men, ages 16-55 years, mean 35 years) with International Headache Society migraine were randomized into two groups. They were instructed to treat three consecutive moderate or severe attacks with either 10 mg rizatriptan (group 1: 18 women and 10 men) or with 10 mg rizatriptan plus 25 mg rofecoxib (group 2: 19 women and 9 men). The presence of headache and nausea at 1, 2 and 4 h, and of side-effects, use of rescue medication and recurrence were compared. Fifty-four patients completed the study. Group 1 treated 76 attacks and group 2 treated 81 attacks. Absence of headache at 1 h was seen in 19 attacks (25%) in group 1 and in 34 attacks (42%) in group 2 (P=0.082); at 2 h absence of headache was seen in 60% of group 1 attacks and in 76% of group 2 attacks (P=0.115). At 4 h, 75% of group 1 attacks and 88% of group 2 attacks were pain free (P=0.122). With regard to nausea, of those who had nausea at baseline, 31% and 49% of attacks in groups 1 and 2, respectively, were nausea free at 1 h (P=0.091), 75% and 79% at 2 h (P=0.736) and 82% and 91% (P=0.479) at 4 h. Recurrence, based on all attacks of those patients who achieved pain free at 4 h, was observed in 53% of group 1 and 20% of group 2 attacks (P<0.001). Sustained pain-free rates (for the 4-h time point) were 45.6% of group 1 and 78.9% of group 2 attacks. There were no significant differences with regard to rescue medication consumption after 4 h and side-effects in both groups. There was a non-significant trend for the combination group to have a higher response rate. The group treated with rizatriptan and rofecoxib had a lower recurrence rate than the group treated with rizatriptan. This study demonstrated that combining a fast acting triptan such as rizatriptan with rofecoxib reduced headache recurrence rates, was well tolerated and may be more effective than the use of rizatriptan alone. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations.",4,E

Meloxicam is a relatively COX-2-selective anti-arthritis drug that shows significant TxA2 inhibition, albeit less than traditional NSAIDs. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 79 healthy adults to compare the effects of once-daily therapeutic (7.5 mg, 15 mg) and supratherapeutic (30 mg) doses of meloxicam with extended-release indomethacin (Indo-ER 75 mg once daily) on bleeding time, TxA2 formation, and platelet aggregation. The authors measured platelet aggregation to COX-1-dependent (ADP arachidonate) and COX-1-independent (high-dose collagen) agonists, bleeding time, serum TxB2, and clotting times (aPTT and PT) after 8 days' administration and at 3 and 6 hours after steady-state dosing. Meloxicam significantly decreased TxB2 production compared with placebo in a dose-dependent fashion, reaching a peak of 77% inhibition 6 hours after 30 mg meloxicam; Indo-ER blocked TxB2 formation by 96% at the same time point. However, neither acute nor 8 days' administration of meloxicam at any dose caused a significant increase in bleeding time or inhibition of platelet aggregation to any agonist when compared with placebo. By contrast, Indo-ER significantly increased the bleeding time and inhibited platelet aggregation to COX-1-dependent agonists 6 hours after dosing. Clotting times were unaffected by any drug. It was concluded that unlike nonselective NSAIDs, meloxicam's blockade of TxA2 formation (even at supratherapeutic doses) does not reach levels that result in decreased in vivo platelet function, as measured by bleeding time and aggregometry. In this study of healthy subjects, meloxicam did not interfere with platelet-mediated hemostasis.",4,E

This study was designed to compare the safety and analgesic efficacy of an over-the-counter (OTC) analgesic, ibuprofen (Advil Liqui-Gels), to the leading prescription COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex). Ibuprofen liquigel is an encapsulated, solubilized potassium salt of ibuprofen that has a higher Cmax and shorter tmax than traditional ibuprofen solid-dosage formulations. This trial evaluated the maximum approved OTC dosing regimen (400 mg x 3, q4-6h) of ibuprofen liquigels compared to a single dose of celecoxib (200 mg) and placebo in 174 patients with moderate orsevere pain following surgical extraction of impacted third molars. The study design was multiple dose, randomized (stratified by baseline pain and gender), placebo controlled, double blind, double dummy, and parallel group. The onset of pain relief was determined using a two-stopwatch procedure. Treatments were also compared using standard indices of pain intensity and pain relief. The study demonstrated assay sensitivity in that both active medications were significantly more effective than placebo for all efficacy measures. In comparing the two active medications, the time to meaningful relief was significantly shorter, and the mean 4-, 8-, and 12-hour summed pain relief combined with pain intensity difference scores were significantly higher for ibuprofen liquigels compared with celecoxib (p < 0.001). Analyses of other key efficacy variables, including the time to rescue medication and the patients' overall assessment of study medication, confirmed the superior efficacy of ibuprofen liquigels over celecoxib. Both active treatments were well tolerated, with no differences in incidence or severity of adverse events. Of particular interest, there were no differences in gastrointestinal-related side effects when comparing these doses of ibuprofen liquigels to celecoxib. In conclusion, ibuprofen liquigels were a significantly more effective analgesic and provided relief significantly faster compared with celecoxib in the treatment of postsurgical pain.",4,E

Parecoxib, an inactive prodrug, is hydrolyzed in vivo to valdecoxib, a substrate for hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Thus, potential exists for interactions with other CYP3A4 substrates. In this investigation, we determined the influence of parecoxib on the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, in volunteers. This was a randomized, balanced crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical investigation. Twelve healthy subjects aged 23-41 yr were studied after providing IRB-approved informed consent. Midazolam 0.07 mg/kg IV infusion was administered 1 h after placebo (control) or parecoxib 40 mg IV. Venous midazolam concentrations were determined by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic variables were determined by noncompartmental analysis. Pharmacodynamic measurements included clinical end-points, cognitive function (memory; digit symbol substitution tests), subjective self-assessment of recovery (visual analog scales), and bispectral index. Midazolam plasma concentrations were similar between placebo and parecoxib-treated subjects. No differences were found in midazolam pharmacokinetics (maximal observed plasma concentration, clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution) or pharmacodynamics (clinical end-points, digit symbol substitution tests, memory, visual analog scales, bispectral index). Single-bolus parecoxib does not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of midazolam infusion. Parecoxib did not affect CYP3A4 activity as assessed using midazolam clearance as the in vivo probe.; Parecoxib, a parenteral cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor intended for perioperative use as an analgesic/antiinflammatory drug, is a substrate for hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4. The potential for a drug interaction with midazolam, an in vivo CYP3A4 probe, was tested in healthy volunteers.

It has been claimed that the new COX-2 inhibitors offer advantages in terms of drug safety. To test this hypothesis, the authors compared in a double-blind, randomized trial the effects of celecoxib (200 mg bid) and diclofenac (75 mg bid) on blood pressure and renal function in two groups (each n = 12) of young (mean age = 32 years) and elderly (mean age = 68 years) normotensive subjects. Changes from baseline in the 24-hour blood pressure profiles, parameters of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inulin clearance, urinary marker proteins, and eicosanoid excretion were monitored during the treatment period of 2 weeks. Comparison between celecoxib and diclofenac showed no significant difference in minor alterations of blood pressure. During daytime, there was a trend to elevation of mean arterial blood pressure (mmHg) by celecoxib in the elderly of 2.8 (95 % confidence interval [CI) = -2.5 to 8.2) in comparison with the young subjects of -1.3 (95% CI= -3.7 to 1.0); there was also a trend to elevation of mean arterial blood pressure by diclofenac in the elderly of 4.1 (95% CI= -1.2 to 9.4) in comparison with the young subjects of 0.4 (95% CI= -2.4 to 3.2). In both populations, the authors found no significant drug effects on the parameters of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inulin clearance, and urinary marker proteins. As expected, diclofenac reduced excretion of allprostanoids, whereas celecoxib did not affect production of TxB2 and its metabolites. Neither in young nor in elderly normotensive subjects were blood pressure and renal function significantly affected by a short-term treatment with standard doses of celecoxib and diclofenac. Therefore, normal aging appears not to represent a special risk factor in therapy with these two agents.",4,E

She had a history of mixed connective tissue disease and had been started on rofecoxib therapy 1 month prior to the onset of her skin symptoms. Discontinuation of rofecoxib was followed by resolution of symptoms within a period of 3 weeks. Similar palmar skin changes following water exposure have been reported to occur in cystic fibrosis and are thought to be due to increased salt content of the skin and secondary increased water-binding capacity. Rofecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that has been shown to increase sodium reabsorption in the kidney via effects on prostaglandin E2 and the renal vasculature. The COX-2 protein is also expressed in keratinocytes and plays a role in keratinocyte differentiation. Prostaglandin E2 also plays a role in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Thus rofecoxib may cause increased sodium reabsorption in the skin, as it does in the kidney. The rofecoxib-associated elevation in skin sodium may increase keratin water-binding capacity and cause exaggerated aquagenic wrinkling of the skin, as occurs in cystic fibrosis.",E,E

During calendar year 2000, the VA spent $13.8 million and $4.2 million on celecoxib and rofecoxib, respectively. The percentage of once-daily or less than once-daily dosing was celecoxib 100 mg (17%), celecoxib 200 mg (67%), celecoxib overall (49%), rofecoxib 12.5 mg (86%), rofecoxib 25 mg (94%), rofecoxib 50 mg (100%), and rofecoxib overall (93%). Based on current utilization, if all celecoxib prescriptions were changed to rofecoxib, the VA would have realized annual cost savings of $2.1 million in calendar year 2000. In calendar year 2001, projected cost savings could total $5.2 million. This potential savings is largely due to the high prevalence of twice-daily celecoxib dosing.; The results of the cyclooxygenase-2 cost minimization analysis provide a compelling argument for the preferred use of rofecoxib in the VA system, and potentially in other managed care systems.",E,E

This study evaluated the effects of celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day on blood pressure (BP) and edema in a 6-week, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study in patients > or =65 years of age with osteoarthritis who were treated with fixed antihypertensive regimens. One thousand ninety-two patients received study medication (celecoxib, n = 549; rofecoxib, n = 543). Significantly more patients in the rofecoxib group compared with the celecoxib group developed increased systolic BP (change >20 mm Hg plus absolute value > or =140 mm Hg) at any time point (14.9% vs 6.9%, p <0.01). Rofecoxib caused the greatest increase in systolic BP in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta blockers, whereas those on calcium channel antagonists or diuretic monotherapy receiving either celecoxib or rofecoxib showed no significant increases in BP. Clinically significant new-onset or worsening edema associated with weight gain developed in a greater percentage of patients in the rofecoxib group (7.7%) compared with the celecoxib group (4.7%) (p <0.05). Thus, in patients with controlled hypertension on a fixed antihypertensive regimen, careful monitoring of BP is warranted after the initiation of celecoxib or rofecoxib therapy.",I,I

Patients undergoing nasal septal or sinus surgery were randomized to receive either oral placebo or rofecoxib 50 mg 1 h before surgery. All patients received propofol 0.8 mg/kg, fentanyl 1 microg/kg, and local anesthesia at the operative site. Sedation was maintained by a continuous infusion of propofol adjusted to maintain sedation at a 2-3 level on the Ramsey scale. Additional fentanyl 0.5-1 microg/kg was administered at the patient's request or if the verbal rating scale score was >4. Patient sedation and pain scores were obtained at 5, 15, 30 45, and 60 min during surgery and 30 min and 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h after completion of the procedure. During the postoperative period, diclofenac 75 mg IM was administered for analgesia at the patient's request or if the visual analog scale (VAS) rating for pain was more than 4. VAS pain scores, intraoperative fentanyl, and postoperative diclofenac requirements were significantly smaller in the rofecoxib group compared with the placebo group (P < 0.001). The times to first analgesic request were also significantly less in the rofecoxib group. We conclude that the preoperative administration of oral rofecoxib provided a significant analgesic benefit and decreased the need for opioids in patients undergoing nasal septal and nasal sinus surgery.; The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and opioid-sparing effect of rofecoxib, a new selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor drug, in ear-nose-throat surgery patients.

The pathways underlying the nongenomic mechanisms are not completely understood. Estrogen-induced responses in vascular cells have been shown to influence prostaglandins and cyclooxygenase (COX), a key enzyme in the production of prostaglandins, with two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. We investigated the effects of prostaglandins on the acute potentiation by 17beta-estradiol (E) of acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated vasodilation in the cutaneous vasculature. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled design, we assessed skin blood flow in 32 healthy, postmenopausal women by laser Doppler velocimetry with direct current iontophoresis of ACh and sodium nitroprusside before and after 6-wk treatment periods with aspirin (a nonspecific COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor), diclofenac (predominantly a COX-2 inhibitor, which also inhibits COX-1), celecoxib (a specific COX-2 inhibitor), given at anti-inflammatory doses, or placebo. Blood flux values before iontophoresis of ACh did not differ between the treatment groups or after E administration, excluding a direct cutaneous vasodilator effect of the treatments or of E. Acute E administration enhanced the response to ACh after aspirin, diclofenac, and placebo; however, this effect was completely abolished with celecoxib treatment (P < 0.05). E had no effect on sodium nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation after any of the treatments. We conclude that the COX-2 pathway plays a specific role in the rapid E-induced potentiation of cholinergic vasodilation in postmenopausal women.",4,E

So far, the strategy of selective COX-2 inhibition has been successful. Selective COX-2 inhibitors have significantly less gastrotoxicity and no effects on platelet aggregation. However, with regard to renal adverse events, selective COX-2 inhibitors do not offer a clinically relevant advantage over non-selective inhibitors. Moreover, concerns over the cardiovascular risk of selective COX-2 inhibitors have recently been raised. The second generation of COX-2 inhibitors with higher COX-2 selectivity was developed with the promise of further reduction of NSAID-typical adverse effects. The leading compounds are valdecoxib, parecoxib, etoricoxib and lumaricoxib. At the present time they have proven efficacy for the treatment of pain and inflammation. Parecoxib as a parenteral, highly selective COX-2 inhibitor has the potential to become the NSAID of choice for treatment of postoperative pain. In clinical trials, valdecoxib, parecoxib, etoricoxib and lumaricoxib have caused no more endoscopic ulcers than placebo. However, to date, no data on the clinically relevant endpoints perforation, symptomatic ulcer and bleeding are available. Furthermore, no definite conclusions on renal and cardiovascular safety are possible. Current evidence points to a marginal, if any, gain of safety compared with the first generation of COX-2 inhibitors. However, trials with the new COX-2 inhibitors offer the chance to address these open questions of highly selective COX-2 inhibition; that is, thrombogenic risk, sodium and water retention, and interference with tissue repair, in particular, healing of mucosal damage.",E,E

No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions were found, although sulphasalazine and glucocorticoids both significantly (P < 0.005) affected meloxicam clearance (+19% and - 12%, respectively). The mechanisms by which these agents affect meloxicam clearance remain to be elucidated.; The population pharmacokinetic meloxicam data from patients with RA gave similar results to those obtained from phase I trials. However, uncommon drug interactions may not be detected in phase I trials because of the small number of observations made.",6,E

A total of 45 patients consented to a double-blind, single-dose oral administration of 50 mg of rofecoxib, 600 mg of ibuprofen, or a placebo before conventional root canal therapy. The root canal treatment was performed in two appointments. Patient-reported visual analog scale ratings of pain intensity were conducted upon initial clinical presentation and at 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after completion of pulpectomy. Results showed that at the 4- and 8-h periods, both rofecoxib and ibuprofen provided significantly better pain relief than placebo. At the 12- and 24-h periods, rofecoxib demonstrated significantly better pain relief than both ibuprofen and placebo. Patients with a periapical diagnosis of acute apical periodontitis showed a significantly increased need for additional medication after completion of pulpectomy compared with all other periapical diagnoses.",4,E

In view of the large number of patients at cardiovascular risk requiring chronic analgesic therapy with COX-2 inhibitors for arthritic and other inflammatory conditions, the effects of selective COX-2 inhibition on clinically useful surrogates for cardiovascular disease, particularly endothelial function, need to be determined.; Fourteen male patients (mean age, 66+/-3 years) with severe coronary artery disease (average of 2.6 vessels with stenosis >75%) undergoing stable background therapy with aspirin and statins were included. The patients received celecoxib (200 mg BID) or placebo for a duration of 2 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion. After each treatment period, flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, oxidized LDL, and prostaglandins were measured. Celecoxib significantly improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation compared with placebo (3.3+/-0.4% versus 2.0+/-0.5%, P=0.026), whereas endothelium-independent vasodilation, as assessed by nitroglycerin, remained unchanged (9.0+/-1.6% versus 9.5+/-1.3%, P=0.75). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was significantly lower after celecoxib (1.3+/-0.4 mg/L) than after placebo (1.8+/-0.5 mg/L, P=0.019), as was oxidized LDL (43.6+/-2.4 versus 47.6+/-2.6 U/L, P=0.028), whereas prostaglandins did not change.; This is the first study to demonstrate that selective COX-2 inhibition improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation and reduces low-grade chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in coronary artery disease. Thus, selective COX-2 inhibition holds the potential to beneficially impact outcome in patients with cardiovascular disease.",2,E

The benefit of Helicobacter pylori eradication in reducing NSAID-associated gastrointestinal toxicity is controversial, and routine testing for and eradication of H. pylori in NSAID users are not currently advised. The gastrointestinal safety of rofecoxib and celecoxib has been assessed in large clinical outcome trials which, on first analysis, show benefits over non-selective NSAIDs in the incidence of serious upper gastrointestinal complications. However, longer term gastrointestinal data from the celecoxib study (CLASS) and cardiovascular adverse event data from the rofecoxib study (VIGOR) have questioned the risk-benefit profile of these new drugs and, until they are better understood, it seems sensible not to use them routinely in large numbers of individuals.

Infusions were 0.2% ropivacaine at 10 mL x hr(-1) for both groups. Infusions were maintained for 48 hr. Patients were discharged on the day of surgery. Verbal analogue pain scores (VAS) and postoperative oxycodone consumption were measured for 48 hr.; Eight patients (47%; four in each group) had side effects or logistical problems complicating care. The mean VAS scores at rest and with movement in the postanesthesia care unit and at 12 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr were not different (P > 0.1). Inadequate analgesia was reported in 50-75% of all study patients. Time until first oxycodone use was similar between groups 829 min +/- 432 (interscalene) and 999 min +/- 823 (intra-articular; P = 0.6).

When the subjects can be grouped into strata (e.g., study sites, gender, race, etc.), there may be a desire to determine whether the experimental treatment is noninferior to the standard in each of the strata. We present five possible analysis strategies to test for heterogeneity of relative treatment effects among strata. These strategies are either identical to or straightforward modifications of strategies that can be used to test for interaction when the objective of the study is to show differences rather than noninferiority. The various analysis strategies implicitly depend on different definitions of interaction. Power of the various tests will be low, a phenomenon that often occurs when testing for interaction. We present simulation results to quantify the power and type I error rates under different scenarios and an example to demonstrate the proposed tests. None of the analysis strategies is best under every parameter configuration. The tests may be best used in a descriptive or exploratory manner.

Separate analyses were conducted for all patients and for those who did not respond to acetaminophen. Outcome probabilities were obtained from a comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Costs were derived from actual resource utilization of OA patients.; In terms of averting GI events, acetaminophen dominates the other options for an average risk patient population. For patients who did not respond to acetaminophen, rofecoxib had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per GI event avoided (32,000 US dollars) relative to ibuprofen. In terms of pain control, ibuprofen had an ICER of 610.77 US dollars per additional patient achieving minimal perceptible clinical improvement (MPCI) relative to acetaminophen, while rofecoxib had an ICER of 12,000 US dollars relative to ibuprofen. For patients who did not respond to acetaminophen and who are at high risk of developing an adverse GI event, rofecoxib dominates ibuprofen as the preferred alternative for both measures of effectiveness. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses established that these results were generally robust.; Our results suggest that for average-risk knee OA patients, acetaminophen dominates the other therapies in terms of cost per GI event averted. In terms of pain relief, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicate that if one values pain relief below 275 US dollars per patient achieving MPCI, acetaminophen is the therapy most likely to be optimal; between 275 US dollars and 14,150 US dollars, ibuprofen is most likely to be optimal; and above 14,150 US dollars, rofecoxib is most likely to be optimal.",2,E

However, blanket advice to avoid all NSAIDs is no longer reasonable. Except for AERD and chronic urticaria, cross-reactivity with other NSAIDs does not occur. A physician can definitively prove this by giving the patient another NSAID in their office and observing no reaction. Furthermore, for patients with AERD and chronic urticaria, they can be given the new selective COX-2 inhibitors (rofecoxib and celecoxib) without any cross-reactivity. All AERD patients can be desensitized to ASA and treated with ASA indefinitely. However, ASA desensitization in chronic urticaria is not possible. Underlying mild and moderate AERD responds well to topical and systemic corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers. However, the severe forms of the disease should be desensitized to ASA and treated with this drug on a long term basis. In the future, new drugs that prevent eosinophil activation and chemotaxis or enhance eosinophil apoptosis are likely to be useful. Specific blockers of the second cystLT receptor would also be useful.

Methods and perspective: A decision analytical model was used to compare the effects of 4 weeks' treatment of osteoarthritis with meloxicam (7.5 mg/day), diclofenac (100 mg/day) and piroxicam (20 mg/day). The decision tree was derived by combining best practice and clinical reality. Analysis was from the NHS perspective. The study considered only the direct costs. These included costs for drug acquisition and management of all adverse events, both serious gastrointestinal events requiring hospitalisation, and non-serious events that required maintenance. Resource use and treatment costs were obtained from local and published sources. A range of sensitivity analyses was carried out.; Based on two 4-week large-scale trials, the Meloxicam Large-scale International Study Safety Assessment (MELISSA) and Safety and Efficacy Large-scale Evaluation of COX-inhibiting Therapies (SELECT) trials, and a decision analytical model, the findings suggested that meloxicam had the lowest cost per patient ( pound 30 versus pound 35 for piroxicam and pound 51 for diclofenac [costs presented as 1998 values except for drug costs which were in 2000 values]). The results of the Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis, using 4000 samples, suggested that meloxicam was the optimal strategy in the drug treatment of patients with osteoarthritis compared with nonselective NSAIDs both individually and as a group. The cost savings were due to lower levels of serious adverse events accompanied by fewer days in intensive care units and shorter overall duration of hospital stay observed with meloxicam compared with diclofenac and piroxicam in the 4-week trials.; Based on the 4-week trial period, meloxicam was predicted to be the lowest cost drug therapy, and thus the optimal drug therapy, in the management of patients with osteoarthritis compared with nonselective NSAIDs such as diclofenac and piroxicam. Applying the cost savings per patient derived from the model, switching patients from piroxicam and diclofenac to meloxicam would indicate a cost saving of over pound 25 million per annum. Models such as this can facilitate better clinical guidance and is a useful way of assessing treatment outcomes.",3,E

However, up to now various postoperative regimens such as the routine administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were often used in combination with enamel matrix proteins. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the results might have been influenced by the effect of the postoperative medication. The aim of this randomized, controlled, blinded, clinical investigation was to determine the effect of postsurgical administration of a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor on the healing of intrabony periodontal defects following regenerative periodontal surgery with EMD. Twenty two patients, each of whom exhibited one deep intrabony defect, were randomly treated with either EMD plus a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor (test) or with EMD alone (control). The postoperative regimen consisted of oral administration of 12.5 mg rofecoxib twice daily for 14 days. The following parameters were recorded at baseline and at 6 months by the same calibrated and blinded investigator: plaque index (Pl), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), pocket depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Power analysis to determine superiority of the anti-inflammatory treatment showed that the available sample size would yield 70% power to detect a 1 mm difference. No statistical significant differences in any of the investigated parameters between the two groups were observed at baseline. The results show that, in the test group, mean PD decreased from 8.7+/-1.4 mm to 4.7+/-2.0 mm (P<0.001) and mean CAL from 9.7+/-2.0 mm to 6.5+/-2.1 mm (P<0.001). In the control group, mean PD decreased from 8.6+/-1.6 mm to 4.7+/-1.8 mm (P<0.001) and mean CAL from 9.5+/-1.6 mm to 6.5+/-2.2 mm (P<0.001). There were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the investigated parameters. Within the limits of the present study, it can be concluded that the systemic administration of a selective COX-2 inhibitor following regenerative periodontal surgery with EMD did not result in additional clinical improvements when compared to treatment with EMD alone.",4,E

This study compared the incidence of endoscopically detected gastroduodenal ulcers in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with rofecoxib or a non-selective NSAID.; In this multicentre, randomised, double blind, 12 week study, patients with rheumatoid arthritis were allocated to rofecoxib 50 mg once daily (n=219), naproxen 500 mg twice daily (n=220), or placebo (n=221). Endoscopy was performed at baseline and at six and 12 weeks. Lifetable analysis and log rank tests were used to analyse the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers > or =3 mm. Gastric or duodenal ulcers > or =5 mm and erosions were also evaluated as secondary end points. Tolerability was assessed by adverse events.; The cumulative incidence of ulcers > or =3 mm at 12 weeks was significantly higher in patients on naproxen (25.5%) than in patients receiving rofecoxib (6.8%; difference 18.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.7%, 25.7%); p<0.001) or placebo (2.9%; difference 22.6% (95% CI 16.1%, 29.1%); p<0.001).

It is therefore possible that higher doses of rofecoxib may affect platelet function. This could be important if rofecoxib is given to thrombocytopenic patients. In these cases, already moderate inhibition of platelet function could precipitate bleeding complications. We therefore set out to investigate the influence of rofecoxib on platelet function in healthy volunteers.; We set up a balanced-randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two way cross-over study. Peripheral blood was withdrawn from 42 healthy volunteers before and 3 hours after intake of 50, 250, 500 mg of rofecoxib or placebo (n = 14 per group). Platelet function was assessed by a platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) which measures collagen-epinephrine induced closure time (CEPI-CT) under shear stress.; CEPI-CT increased by 14% (p = 0.002) and 11% (p = 0.003) three hours after intake of placebo and rofecoxib at dosages of up to 500 mg, respectively. The increase in CEPI-CT versus baseline was not significantly different in the placebo period compared with the active treatment periods (n = 42, p > 0.05).; Rofecoxib does not impair platelet function.

Recently, head-to-head, randomized, controlled trials have shown a significantly higher incidence of blood pressure (BP) destabilization and clinically significant edema with rofecoxib than with celecoxib among older, hypertensive patients with osteoarthritis (OA).; The objective of this analysis was to estimate the COX-2 specific inhibitor medication costs, in addition to the costs of drugs and physicians' fees, for BP destabilization and clinically significant edema associated with the use of rofecoxib 25 mg QD and celecoxib 200 mg QD in patients with OA and hypertension in a Medicare Choice population (aged > or = 65 years).; A decision analysis model was constructed to determine the costs (from the payer's perspective) of treating patients in this population with either of the 2 regimens for 6 weeks. The analysis used pooled data from 2 recent, independently conducted, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials of OA patients aged > or = 65 years with treated hypertension who received either celecoxib 200 mg QD or rofecoxib 25 mg QD for 6 weeks. In the individual trials, rofecoxib was associated with significantly higher rates of destabilized BP (P < 0.032 and P < 0.001) and edema (P < 0.01 and P = 0.045) than celecoxib.; For a 100,000-member Medicare Choice population, an estimated 25,630 persons would have OA and hypertension (stages I-III), and an estimated 5126 of these patients would use celecoxib or rofecoxib. The estimated costs were 33,938 dollars (6.2%) higher if all hypertensive patients with OA were treated with rofecoxib rather than celecoxib for 6 weeks. The cost per day of use was 0.16 dollars less with celecoxib, and per-patient, per-month costs were 4.79 dollars lower.; Celecoxib was a less costly treatment option than rofecoxib among OA patients with hypertension aged > or = 65 years, based on our model of the direct costs of COX-2 specific inhibitor therapy combined with those associated with physician monitoring and treatment of edema and BP destabilization.",2,E

Here we add the results of a systematic review of the effect of dietary and chemopreventive agents on the tumor yield in Min mice. The review is based on the results of 179 studies from 71 articles and is displayed also on the internet http://corpet.net/min.(2) We compared the efficacy of agents in the Min mouse model and the AOM rat model, and found that they were correlated (r = 0.66; P < 0.001), although some agents that afford strong protection in the AOM rat and the Min mouse small bowel increase the tumor yield in the large bowel of mutant mice. The agents included piroxicam, sulindac, celecoxib, difluoromethylornithine, and polyethylene glycol. The reason for this discrepancy is not known. We also compare the results of rodent studies with those of clinical intervention studies of polyp recurrence. We found that the effect of most of the agents tested was consistent across the animal and clinical models. Our point is thus: rodent models can provide guidance in the selection of prevention approaches to human colon cancer, in particular they suggest that polyethylene glycol, hesperidin, protease inhibitor, sphingomyelin, physical exercise, epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor, (+)-catechin, resveratrol, fish oil, curcumin, caffeate, and thiosulfonate are likely important preventive agents.",4,E

Platelet aggregation (to sodium arachidonate, collagen, and adenosine diphosphate), bleeding time, and serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) concentrations were measured up to 8 hours postdose on Days 1 and 8. Valdecoxib had no platelet effects, while ibuprofen significantly decreased platelet aggregation, significantly increased bleeding time (2-4 h postdose on each day), and significantly decreased TxB2 levels at all time points. In conclusion, unlike ibuprofen, valdecoxib 40 mg bid spares platelet COX-1 function in healthy elderly subjects.

Excessive bleeding is the main presenting complaint in women referred to gynecologists and it accounts for two-thirds of all hysterectomies, and most of endoscopic endometrial destructive surgery. Thus, menorrhagia is an important healthcare problem. Its etiology, investigation, medical and surgical management are described. In approximately 50% of cases of menorrhagia no pathology is found at hysterectomy. Abnormal levels of prostaglandins or the fibrinolytic system in the endometrium have been implicated. Effective medical treatments suitable for long-term use include intrauterine progestogens, antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (mefenamic acid).

No studies have directly compared the analgesic efficacy of different doses of celecoxib for the prevention of postoperative pain. In this prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we compared oral celecoxib 200 mg to 400 mg when administered for premedication of outpatients undergoing minor ear-nose-throat surgery. A total of 93 healthy outpatients were assigned to 1 of 3 study groups: control (placebo; n = 30), celecoxib 200 mg (n = 30), or celecoxib 400 mg (n = 33). The study drug was given orally 30-45 min before surgery, and all patients received a standardized general anesthetic technique. During the postoperative period, pain scores (0-10), recovery times, the need for rescue analgesics, quality of recovery (0-100), patient satisfaction with pain management (0-100), and side effects were recorded. Pain was assessed at 30-min intervals using a verbal rating scale, with 0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable, in the postanesthesia care unit and day surgery unit recovery areas and at 24 h after surgery. Celecoxib 400 mg was significantly more effective than 200 mg (and placebo) in reducing postoperative pain. Both celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg were more effective than placebo in reducing the postoperative fentanyl requirement (74 +/- 67 micro g and 56 +/- 62 micro g versus 120 +/- 86 micro g, respectively). The larger dose of celecoxib significantly reduced the percentage of patients with severe pain at discharge (6% versus 37% and 30% in the celecoxib 200 mg and control groups, respectively). The median number of doses of oral analgesic medication after discharge was also significantly reduced in the celecoxib 400 mg group (0 versus 2 and 2 in the celecoxib 200 mg and control groups, respectively). However, no differences were found among the three study groups with respect to recovery times and secondary outcome variables (e.g., patient satisfaction and quality of recovery). We conclude that oral premedication with celecoxib 400 mg was more effective than 200 mg in reducing severe postoperative pain and the need for rescue analgesic medication in the postoperative period.; Oral premedication with celecoxib 400 mg was more effective than 200 mg in reducing postoperative pain and the need for rescue analgesic medication in the early postoperative period.

NSAIDs (other than aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]) are also enjoying greater popularity as antipyretics since the recognition of Reye's syndrome's putative association with aspirin. In neonates, NSAIDs have been used for many years in an attempt to pharmacologically close the ductus arteriosus. This review examines the various NSAIDs and their potential and real applications in the neonatal population. For completeness, acetaminophen (paracetamol), which has weak NSAID activity and is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic in this patient group, was also included. The prostaglandin system is important for healthy development, and conversely there are unique risks posed by pharmacologic interference with this system in the neonatal period. The prostanoid system in neonates has the capacity to modulate nociception, but comes at the expense of interfering with nearly every organ system. Physiologic effects of inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis applicable to neonates include disruption of the sleep cycle, increased risk of pulmonary hypertension, alterations in cerebral blood flow, decreased renal function, disrupted thermoregulation, and alterations in hemostasis balance, among others. Prostaglandins are also important for the normal development of the central nervous, cardiovascular, and renal systems, and there is evidence that the proper genesis of these systems may be adversely effected by NSAID exposure in utero and in the neonatal period. Gastrointestinal adverse effects have provided the impetus for the development and marketing of selective cyclo-oxygenase type 2 (COX-2) inhibitors. These agents' reputation for safety in adults may not be applicable to neonates. COX-2 is involved in the development of several organ systems, and its inhibition may induce a prothrombotic state. The advent of parenteral formulations of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, including COX-2-selective agents, increases the therapeutic flexibility of NSAIDs. However, objective data on the safety of these agents have not kept pace with their clinical availability.",4,E

Traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both isoenzymes, resulting in damage to the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum, but also in cardioprotection. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are less likely to damage the upper gastrointestinal tract, as has been shown by large, randomized, controlled trials. Specifically, the newer agents are superior to ibuprofen and naproxen in this regard, but celecoxib and diclofenac were not significantly different in patients who were not also taking low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. These studies did not include a placebo arm, however, and controlled comparisons of COX-2 inhibitors with placebo have not enlisted enough subjects to demonstrate conclusively that they are equally safe. Selectivity for the COX-2 isoform affords protection against upper gastrointestinal toxicity possibly at the expense of the cardioprotective effect of traditional NSAIDs. This might explain the higher rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients who are given rofecoxib compared with naproxen. A traditional NSAID, combined with either misoprostol or a proton pump inhibitor, is still a suitable alternative to selective COX-2 inhibitors for the treatment of arthritis.",5,E

Probability estimates were derived from detailed data of 2 randomized trials and a systematic search of the medical literature. Utility estimates were obtained from 60 randomly selected members of the general public. Cost estimates were obtained from Canadian provincial databases. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for patients at average risk of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) events and for high-risk patients with a prior history of a UGI event. Subjects were patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where a decision has been made to treat with NSAIDs but who do not require low-dose aspirin. Main outcome measures were proportion of patients with clinical or complicated UGI events, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and life expectancy.; Evaluation of rofecoxib versus naproxen in patients with RA at average risk resulted in costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $Can271,188. Celecoxib was dominated by diclofenac in average-risk patients. Both rofecoxib and celecoxib are cost-effective in high-risk patients. Analyses by age groups and assuming a threshold of Can$50,000 per QALY gained, suggest that rofecoxib or celecoxib would be cost-effective in patients aged over 76 and 81, respectively, without additional risk factors.; Both rofecoxib and celecoxib are economically attractive in high risk and elderly patients. They are not economically attractive in patients at average risk. Coprescription of proton-pump inhibitors with COX-2 NSAIDs is not economically attractive for patients at high risk.",2,E

A Medline and Cancerlit literature search was conducted for the period 1993-2002, and identified literature was reviewed. There is evidence from in vitro studies, as well as animal models, that inhibition of COX-2 may suppress carcinogenesis by affecting a number of pathways of carcinogenesis, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis. Preliminary studies of gastro-intestinal (GI) carcinogenesis suggest that COX-2 inhibitors may represent an approach to the chemoprevention of epithelial cancers.

Many agents have been proposed for the treatment of PsA, but their use is based more on clinical experience than on sound scientific evidence.; We reviewed MedLine up to November 2002, searching for 'psoriatic arthritis', 'drug therapy, 'controlled trials' and 'outcomes' and all possible acronyms for these terms. All relevant papers were then examined in detail.; PsA is a condition that runs a variable clinical course. Mild forms can usually be controlled by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are indicated in patients with persistent mono- or oligoarthritis. Patients with severe and progressive articular disease not responsive to NSAIDs should be treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to prevent joint damage and disability. Currently, methotrexate and sulphasalazine are considered the DMARDs of choice, but the evidence for the use of methotrexate in PsA is still largely empirical, while the clinical benefit induced by sulphasalazine appears to be modest. Other DMARDs proposed for the treatment of PsA include cyclosporin, gold salts and, more recently, leflunomide. However, none of the DMARDs available to date are effective in the treatment of psoriatic pelvispondylitis; in addition, a number of patients with severe peripheral arthritis fail to respond to standard DMARDs. Recently, tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors have proved effective in many PsA patients with pelvispondylitis or recalcitrant peripheral synovitis.; None of the current treatments for PsA is curative, but significant clinical amelioration can be achieved in the vast majority of patients. Identification and prompt treatment of patients with severe articular disease is crucial for the achievement of a satisfactory clinical response and the improvement of the long-term outcome.",4,E

Minor adverse events, such as pain and PONV, are still common. The occurrence of these minor adverse advents is now the major area of quality assessment and an area where improvement could be targeted.

The relationship between these two scales and their relative precision in discriminating active from placebo treatment in OA patients was determined.; Patient overall pain assessment, and patient and investigator global assessments were each measured on a 100mm VAS and on a 0 to 4 point Likert scale in a 6-week OA study of rofecoxib vs placebo. The relationship between the VAS and Likert responses was examined graphically and via summary statistics. Analysis of variance was used to assess consistency of the VAS/Likert relationship over time and across the different endpoints. Precision was compared using effect size, and normality of VAS scale of measurement was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test.; Mean VAS scores and changes from baseline at individual time points were generally highly correlated with corresponding Likert responses (r-values generally approximately 0.7-0.8). The magnitude of VAS values and changes varied depending on endpoint, on the associated magnitude of increment of Likert score, and on the Likert baseline value (i.e., where on the Likert scale the change was occurring). Precision of VAS and Likert responses to detect difference between treatments was generally similar with effect sizes approximately 1. Normality and homogeneity of variance of VAS scores was most closely approximated by actual changes in comparison to percent change or log-transformed measures.; VAS and Likert responses are highly correlated and yield similar precision for discriminating treatments in OA patients. Since Likert responses are easier to administer and interpret, they may be preferable to measure OA response.",3,E

Patients were allocated at a ratio of 2:1 to parecoxib/valdecoxib or standard care (control) groups, respectively. Intravenous study drug (40 mg) was administered within 30 minutes after extubation and every 12 hours for a minimum of 3 days. Subsequently, oral treatment at a dose of 40 mg every 12 hours was initiated and administered for a combined total of 14 days. Patient-controlled analgesia with morphine, oral opioids, or acetaminophen was available as required. Assessment of the analgesic efficacy of the study drug was primarily based on morphine and morphine equivalent use. Additional efficacy evaluations included daily pain intensity, patient and physician global evaluation of study medication, and pain effect on quality of life. Clinical adverse events were assessed by the principal investigator at each site from the time of the first dose through the 30-day postdosing period.; Patients in the parecoxib/valdecoxib group received significantly less morphine or morphine equivalents than patients in the control group during the 0- to 24-hour (P =.009), 24- to 48-hour (P =.017), 72- to 96-hour (P =.002), 96- to 120-hour (P =.004), and 120- to 144-hour (P =.037) periods. Both patients (P <.001) and physicians (P <.001) evaluated the study medication as significantly better than control therapy. The modified Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire used in the oral dosing period detected significant improvements in the parecoxib/valdecoxib treatment group in 6 of 8 domains tested (eg, current pain, worst pain, and mood) beginning on day 4 and continuing for at least 4 days. Although there were no differences between the groups in overall adverse events, serious adverse events occurred twice as frequently in parecoxib/valdecoxib-treated patients (19.0%, 59/311 patients) than in control patients (9.9%, 15/151 patients; P =.015). Regarding individual serious adverse events, a greater incidence in sternal wound infection was found in the parecoxib/valdecoxib patients (10 [3.2%]) versus control patients (0 [0%]) (P =.035). The incidences of other individual serious adverse events, including cerebrovascular complications, myocardial infarction, and renal dysfunction, were proportionally greater but not significantly different between the groups.; In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, the cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor combination, parecoxib/valdecoxib, was effective for postoperative analgesia. However, the 14-day treatment regimen also was associated with an increased incidence of serious adverse events overall and sternal wound infections in particular. Therefore our study raises important concerns requiring their comprehensive evaluation in a large-scale trial before these cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors are used in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.",4,E

The mechanism by which this peptide induces neurodegeneration may involve inflammatory processes. Pharmacological suppression of inflammation may therefore ameliorate the neuropathology. Basic research studies provide substantial evidence that inflammatory processes present in the brains of patients with AD are destructive, and that anti-inflammatory drugs can provide protection. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the risk of AD. However, there is not yet any strong evidence from completed randomised controlled trials that anti-inflammatory treatment is beneficial. Large trials of glucocorticoid therapy, hydroxychloroquine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of AD have so far been disappointing.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare scratch-patch and patch tests prospectively with frequently used drugs in persons exposed or not exposed to the drug in order to define a nonirritating concentration.; Altogether, 23 different drugs, mainly antibiotics and analgesics, were evaluated. Any contraindications for patch tests were excluded by a questionnaire. Sixty-one healthy individuals were tested. They were divided into two groups: Group 1 consisted of individuals who hadn't been exposed to the drug; Group 2 was comprised of individuals who had been exposed to the drug, without side effects. Each individual was tested with 10-20 scratch-patch and patch tests. The tests were performed on the upper back. Freshly prepared drug solutions were applied, on one side after scarification of the epidermis, on the other side without. Scratch-patch tests were read at 24 and 48 h, patch tests after 48 and 72 h. In addition, we included 73 individuals with a drug allergy to illustrate that the chosen drug concentrations are able to elicit a positive reaction in truly sensitized individuals.; A positive reaction in the non-exposed and nonallergic individuals was considered to be an irritant reaction (IR). In Group 1 (non-exposed individuals), 341 scratch-patch tests were performed, with 22 showing a reaction at the first reading, 3 at the second. Of the 341 patch tests performed in this group, 21 reactions were observed at the first reading, and 7 at the second. In Group 2 (exposed individuals), 141 scratch-patch tests were performed, with 5 IR at the first reading and 1 at the second. Of the 138 patch tests performed in this group, 6 individuals showed an IR at the first, 2 at the second reading. The majority of IR were four drugs, namely cefuroxim, acetylsalicylic acid, propyphenazone/drofenin-HCl, and celecoxib. Lowering the concentration did not reduce the unspecified irritant skin reaction, while a change of the solvent (petrolatum instead of PBS) did reduce the IR.; Our data show concentrations of 23 drugs suitable for scratch-patch or patch tests, as they do not elicit IR. Fourteen of these test preparations elicited a positive reaction in truly sensitized individuals, demonstrating that the test preparation is suitable to identify sensitized persons. Scratch-patch tests are an interesting alternative to patch tests, as they do not elicit more IR than patch tests but can be evaluated earlier. Certain drugs solved in PBS are irritant over a wide dosage range and need to be applied in petrolatum.",4,E

Therefore, choosing an alternative anti-inflammatory agent for patients who have suffered adverse reactions to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent is a common problem in clinical practice. The discoveries that cyclooxygenase COX-2 is an inducible form of COX involved in inflammation and COX-1 is the major isoform responsible for the production of prostaglandins have provided a reasonable basis for the development of specific COX-2 inhibitors as a new class of anti-inflammatory agents.; The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that celecoxib, a specific inhibitor of COX-2, does not cause asthmatic attacks in patients with aspirin and/or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthma.; We studied 33 patients, all of whom suffered from asthma induced by at least two different NSAID drugs. They were challenged in a single-blind manner with different doses of celecoxib on three different days, until either the therapeutic dose of 200 mg or intolerance was reached. Each patient was rechallenged with 200 mg celecoxib seven days later if no evidence of intolerance was previously observed.; Celecoxib 200 mg was proven to be well tolerated in all 30 three aspirin- and NSAID-induced asthma patients.; Our study appears to demonstrate that celecoxib is a suitable NSAID in aspirin-induced and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthma patients.",4,E

One hypothesis is that COX-1 inhibition may play a relevant pathogenic role. If so, drugs that are not active on COX-1 would be expected to be well tolerated by CU patients.; This study aimed at assessing the tolerability of a central analgesic (tramadol) in a group of patients with CU and a history of intolerance to several NSAIDs, asking for a safe, alternative compound.; Twenty-eight patients with CU exacerbated by several, distinct NSAIDs underwent single-blind, placebo-controlled, oral challenges with increasing doses of tramadol (50 mg total dose). Most of them underwent oral challenges with rofecoxib, paracetamol, and/or nimesulide as well.; Twenty-three patients tolerated tramadol, whereas, surprisingly, in 5 (18%) patients tramadol induced urticaria, in one case with laryngeal edema. A similar proportion of CU patients did not tolerate rofecoxib, and higher proportions of patients did not tolerate acetaminophen and nimesulide.; Mechanisms other than COX inhibition may also play a role in drug intolerance in patients with CU. In CU patients intolerant to NSAID, the tolerability of tramadol, as well as of other ""alternative"" drugs, should be assessed by oral challenge tests.",4,E

In a clinical pilot study, 12 consecutive patients with pretreated advanced melanoma, meeting the eligibility criteria were enrolled. Patients received combined daily treosulfan chemotherapy (500 mg) with rofecoxib (25 mg). Metastatic lesions were assessed every 12 weeks. Patients with responsive or stable disease were eligible for a further 12-week treatment period. Response criteria according to the WHO handbook for reporting results of cancer treatment were applied. Side effects were classified according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria v2.0.; At noncytotoxic concentrations, treosulfan inhibited endothelial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. Simultaneous inhibition of COX-2 significantly increased the extent to which treosulfan suppressed cell proliferation, without inducing cytotoxicity. In the pilot study in which 12 patients were treated, toxicity was mild; only hematologic toxicity of grade II was seen. An objective response was noted in one patient, and four patients showed stabilization of their disease for 24 weeks (one) and 36 weeks (three). The patient who had a partial response subsequently showed stable disease for 48 weeks. The median survival time was 13 months.; As increases in response rates following polychemo- or biochemotherapy have not been shown to correlate with prolongation in overall survival, more durable control of metastatic melanoma represents an attractive therapeutic goal. Thus, regimens scheduled to primarily target endothelial cells may potentially provide a palliative alternative that preserves quality of life in the absence of significant treatment-related toxicity.",4,E

The high incidence and mortality make effective prevention an important public-health and economic issue. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis and are among the few agents known to be chemopreventive. Randomised trials have shown that sulindac and celecoxib suppress the development of adenomatous polyps and cause regression of existing polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), who have a high risk for developing colorectal cancer. The mechanisms by which NSAIDs inhibit neoplastic growth are not fully known.; Two recently reported randomised placebo-controlled trials show a chemopreventive effect of aspirin in populations other than those with FAP (Robert Sandler and colleagues, N Engl J Med 2003; 348: 883-90; John Baron and colleagues, N Engl J Med 2003; 348: 891-99). In the Sandler study 635 patients with colorectal cancer were randomised to receive 325 mg aspirin or placebo daily. After a follow-up of around 31 months, the mean number of adenomas was lower in the aspirin group than in the placebo group, corresponding to a relative risk of any recurrent adenoma in the aspirin group of 0.65. In the Baron study 1121 patients with colorectal adenomas were assigned to receive 81 or 325 mg aspirin or placebo daily. Follow-up colonoscopy, 32 months after the index endoscopy, showed an incidence of one or more adenomas of 38% in the 81 mg aspirin group, 45% in the 325 mg aspirin group, and 47% in the placebo group. Together, these studies indicate a moderate chemopreventive effect of aspirin in populations with an intermediate risk of developing colorectal cancer. WHERE NEXT? The anticancer properties of NSAIDs have been demonstrated in vitro and in animal studies, epidemiological reports, and intervention studies. Several mechanisms through which NSAIDs alter colonic carcinogenesis have been elucidated, including the induction of apoptosis in neoplastic cells, via mechanisms dependent and independent of cyclo-oxygenase. Some studies have suggested an important role for the cell-cycle regulating protein p21 in mediating the chemopreventive effect of sulindac. A decrease in p21 expression may be one of the main oncogenic events in the development of colorectal cancer. Thus p21 could be the molecular link in the chemopreventive effects of NSAIDs.",4,E

The occurrence of gastrointestinal complications was measured.; In addition to a recent history of peptic ulcer bleeding, all patients had at least 1 other risk factor and 112 (45.3%) had 3 or more risk factors; 78.9% were taking low-dose aspirin and the remainder non-aspirin NSAIDs. Mean follow-up was 14.6 +/- 10.38 months. Three patients taking low-dose aspirin developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding (1.2%; 95% CI 0.3-3.5; 1.0 event/100 patients/year). This was similar to the rate observed in studies involving non-high-risk patients taking low-dose aspirin and higher than that observed in patients not taking low-dose aspirin. Two additional patients developed a lower gastrointestinal bleeding event (0.81% (0.04%-3.12%); 0.67 events/100 patients/year), which was within the range expected in NSAID users.; The use of omeprazole in the high-risk patient taking low-dose aspirin or NSAIDs seems to be a safe therapeutic approach in this population and is associated with a low frequency of upper gastrointestinal complications.",I,3

However, over the past few years there have been major advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of this tumour and its progression from adenoma to carcinoma that hold potential for translation into novel strategies for the treatment of CRC. Furthermore, newer agents directed against different intracellular targets have also been shown to be efficacious in CRC treatment.

The primary analysis used the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration end points, which include: (1) cardiovascular, hemorrhagic, and unknown deaths, (2) nonfatal myocardial infarction, and (3) nonfatal stroke. Other secondary thrombotic events were also examined. Separate analyses were performed for all patients and for those not taking aspirin. Data from all controlled, completed arthritis trials of > or =4 weeks duration, including 13 new drug application studies and 2 large post-marketing trials (CLASS and SUCCESS) were included for analyses.

For these patients, detailed clinical data were obtained and reviewed by 2 of the investigators (WBW and JSB), who were independently and blinded to exposure, to classify the event as primary, secondary, or neither. All analyses were done using the intent-to-treat population, and time-to-event analyses were performed using per-patient data. To examine heterogeneity of results among studies, tests of interaction were performed using the Cox model. Incidences of the primary and secondary events were not significantly different between the celecoxib and placebo groups, nor for the celecoxib group compared with the NSAIDs group, regardless of aspirin use and NSAID type.

Response and survival rates were similar in the two treatment arms, however, the toxicity profile of pemetrexed was superior to that of docetaxel with significantly less Grade 3/4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Fewer patients in the pemetrexed arm required hospitalization. Topotecan (Hycamtin) 2.3 mg/m2/day orally for 5 days has been compared with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in a large 800-patient study. The results of this trial are awaited. Gemcitabine (Gemzar) and irinotecan (Campto) have been evaluated both as single agents and in combination with each other and study results do not suggest that either of these drugs is superior to docetaxel or pemetrexed. The vinca alkaloid vinorelbine has proved to be inferior to docetaxel in a randomized trial. The epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa) and erlotinib (CP-358774, OSI 774, Tarceva) have been evaluated in Phase II trials in the second- and third-line setting. Both drugs have demonstrated interesting response rates ranging from 10 to almost 20%. The results of placebo-controlled randomized trials of this family of drugs are awaited. In summary, several studies have now found a definite role for the second-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",4,E

A variety of medicines and techniques can be used to successfully treat pain. It is postulated that improved analgesia leads to improved outcomes, although analgesics may also contribute to morbidity. This article reviews the literature evaluating the cost-effectiveness of providing different types of postoperative analgesics and finds that most studies are so poorly conducted that they prevent definitive conclusions being made. The author suggests that further studies be done using analgesics as just one part of a multimodal rehabilitation approach with careful attention to defining outcome, costs and achieving sufficient power to find or exclude meaningful differences.",2,E

We tested the antineoplastic activity of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib on human CRC liver metastases by measuring surrogate markers of tumor growth and angiogenesis in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.; Patients undergoing liver resection surgery for metastatic disease were randomized to receive rofecoxib 25 mg daily or placebo before surgery (duration, >14 days). The apoptosis index (AI; neocytokeratin 18), proliferation index (PI; Ki-67), and microvessel density (MVD; CD31) were measured in metastases by immunohistochemistry. The effect of rofecoxib on COX-2-positive HCA-7 human CRC cell PGE(2) synthesis, proliferation, and apoptosis in vitro was also investigated.; Patients who received rofecoxib (n = 23) and placebo (n = 21) were well matched regarding clinical and metastasis characteristics. The mean (range) duration of rofecoxib therapy was 26 (14-46) days. Rofecoxib-treated metastases had a 29% decrease in MVD (mean, 25.1 [SEM, 2.7] per hpf) compared with placebo-treated tissue (32.5 [SEM, 4.5] per hpf; P = 0.15). There was little difference in AI (rofecoxib mean, 2.03% [SEM, 0.43%] vs. placebo 1.39% [SEM, 0.39%]) or PI (rofecoxib 54.7% [SEM, 5.1%] vs. placebo 52.6% [SEM, 5.6%]). Rofecoxib-induced growth arrest and apoptosis of HCA-7 cells occurred only at concentrations (>10 micromol/L), which were significantly higher than the IC(50) for COX-2 inhibition.; Rofecoxib may negatively regulate angiogenesis in human CRC liver metastases.

Selective COX-2 inhibitors block ATL formation and exacerbate mucosal injury in rats treated with aspirin. In the present study, we have examined whether inhibition of COX-2 activity in healthy volunteers taking aspirin exacerbates gastric mucosal injury and if such an effect would be prevented by NCX-4016, a NO-releasing derivative of aspirin. Thirty-two volunteers were randomized to receive 2 wk of treatment with NCX-4016 (800 mg twice a day) or aspirin (100 mg once a day) alone or in combination with 200 mg of celecoxib twice a day. Mucosal damage was assessed by endoscopy. The mean mucosal injury score was 5.8 +/- 1.8 in subjects treated with aspirin and 2.4 +/- 0.7 (P < 0.01 vs. aspirin) in subjects treated with NCX-4016. Administration of celecoxib increased the injury score in volunteers treated with aspirin (9.9 +/- 1.9) but not in subjects taking NCX-4016 (1.5 +/- 0.8). Aspirin and NCX-4016 caused a comparable suppression of serum thromboxane B2 levels and increased urinary excretion of ATL. Celecoxib inhibited endotoxin-induced prostaglandin E2 generation in whole blood by approximately 80% and abolished ATL formation. These findings suggests that (i) aspirin and NCX-4016 trigger ATL formation in humans, (ii) celecoxib inhibits ATL formation and exacerbates the mucosal injury caused by low doses of aspirin, and (iii) the NO-donating moiety of NCX-4016 protects the gastric mucosa even in the presence of suppression of COX-1 and COX-2.",3,E

We evaluated the effects of oral nimesulide (100mg), celecoxib (200mg) and rofecoxib (25mg). Each drug was administered for 7 days.; Analgesic efficacy was determined using the patient's assessment of pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and by total pain relief over 3 hours (TOPAR3) on the first and last days of treatment. In addition, the overall analgesic efficacy and tolerability were determined by a global assessment by the patient at the end of each week of treatment, using 5-point categorical scales. At the end of the study, each patient was asked about which of the three forms of treatment they would choose as a continuation of the pain therapy.; Taking all the results into consideration, nimesulide proved to be significantly more effective in providing symptomatic relief than did celecoxib and rofecoxib. Furthermore, nimesulide provided more rapid relief of pain associated with walking than did the other two drugs tested. Patients expressed similar preference for nimesulide and rofecoxib, but a lesser preference for celecoxib treatment. No patient withdrew from the study because of adverse events and the three different forms of treatment were generally safe and well tolerated.; The present data confirm our previous observations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, further suggesting that nimesulide represents an effective agent for the treatment of joint pain, with particular reference to the rapid onset of its analgesic effect.",I,I

Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors appear to alter the balance of vasoactive eicosanoids (prostacyclin and thromboxane) and to suppress the inflammatory mediators implicated in the progression of atherogenesis and ischemic myocardial injury. Neutral, harmful, and beneficial cardiovascular (CV) effects have all been postulated to result from these changes. Investigations conducted with rofecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, have substantially contributed to our understanding of this scientific area. Rofecoxib had little or no effect on platelet aggregation or platelet-derived thromboxane synthesis but reduced systemic prostacyclin synthesis by 50% to 60%. These findings prompted extensive analyses of CV thrombotic events within the rofecoxib development program. Among 5435 osteoarthritis trial participants, similar rates of CV thrombotic events were reported with rofecoxib, placebo, and comparator, nonselective NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, and nabumetone). In the VIGOR gastrointestinal outcomes trial of >8000 patients, naproxen (an NSAID with aspirin-like sustained antiplatelet effects throughout its dosing interval) was associated with a significantly lower risk of CV events than was rofecoxib. A subsequent pooled analysis from 23 studies (including VIGOR) encompassing multiple disease states and including more than 14,000 patient-years at risk also demonstrated that rofecoxib was not associated with excess CV thrombotic events compared with either placebo or nonnaproxen NSAIDs. Again, naproxen appeared to be the outlier, suggesting a cardioprotective benefit of naproxen. Finally, among the predominantly elderly, male population participating in Alzheimer trials, both rofecoxib- and placebo-treated patients had similar rates of CV thrombotic events. The totality of data is not consistent with an increased CV risk among patients taking rofecoxib.",5,E

Prostaglandins are lipid signaling mediators that play a central role in a broad range of diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, including inflammation, reproduction, nocioception, and gastrointestinal protection. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity is the mechanism by which nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) exert their analgesic, antipyretic, antiinflammatory, and antithrombotic effects. COX is currently believed to exist in three isoforms. In this review, we provide a concise state-of-the-art description of the role of COX in pharmacology and toxicology of skin including its involvement in normal physiology, cutaneous inflammation, nociception, wound healing, and tumorigenesis. COX-dependent pathways influence keratinocyte differentiation, hair follicle development, and hair growth. The critical role of COX-2 in pathophysiology of skin is also addressed. COX-2 mediates inflammatory processes in skin, including inflammatory hyperalgesia and nociception, and administration of specific COX-2 inhibitors reduces edema, vascular permeability, and other markers of cutaneous inflammation. A number of studies in animal models and in humans show that COX-2 inhibitors possess cancer chemopreventive properties. Selective COX-2 inhibitors have a more favorable side-effect profile. Topical formulations of COX-2 inhibitors are being developed as a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of COX-2 mediated skin diseases.",5,E

This is because they are just as effective as NSAIDs in relieving arthritic pain and yet less gastrotoxic. However, the cardiovascular safety of selective COX-2 inhibitors has been questioned because they selectively reduce prostacyclin production, thus disrupting the normal homeostatic balance and promoting a prothrombotic state. These theoretical concerns appear to be supported by the results of clinical trials demonstrating an increased risk of myocardial infarction with COX-2 inhibitors compared with a conventional NSAID, and indirect comparisons of the rates of myocardial infarction among patients treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor compared with aspirin in different trials. However, emerging data from animal, experimental and clinical studies suggest that COX-2 is atherogenic and thrombogenic, and that selective COX-2 inhibitors may be cardioprotective. Meta-analyses of randomized trials of selective COX-2 inhibitors compared with placebo have demonstrated no excess of cardiovascular events among patients allocated COX-2 inhibitors, and preliminary data from a randomized controlled trial of the selective COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam, in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were treated with aspirin, demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events among patients allocated the COX-2 inhibitor.; Continuing uncertainty regarding the direction and magnitude of any cardiovascular effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors, coupled with their widespread and increasing use, mandates prospective randomized evaluation of their efficacy and safety in patients at increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",5,E

Analgesia was seen after each dose of methadone. As compared with placebo, the 20 mg daily dose (given as 10 mg bd) resulted in statistically significant (P = 0.013-0.020) improvements in patient Visual Analogue Scale ratings of maximum pain intensity, average pain intensity and pain relief, recorded at the same time daily. The analgesic effects extended over 48 hours, as shown by statistically significant (P = 0.013-0.020) improvements in all three outcomes on the rest days instituted between each daily dose. Analgesic effects (lowered maximum pain intensity and increased pain relief, on the day of dosing only) were also seen when the lower daily dose of 10 mg methadone (given as 5 mg bd) was used, but these failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.064 and 0.065, respectively). Interpatient analysis showed that the analgesic effects were not restricted to any particular type of neuropathic pain. Patient compliance was high throughout the trial. One patient withdrew during the 10 mg and six during the 20 mg methadone treatment periods.

Our goal was to determine the statistical power of predefined dichotomous outcome measures (termed ""a priori""), compared with that of continuous measures derived from trial data in which there was no predefined response threshold (termed ""data driven""), and to evaluate the sensitivity to change of these measures in the context of different treatments and early versus later-stage disease. In order to generalize beyond results from a single trial, we performed simulation studies.; We obtained summary data from trials comparing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and from comparative coxib-placebo trials to test the power of 2 a priori outcomes, the ACR20 and improvement of the Disease Activity Score (DDAS), as well as 2 data-driven outcomes. We studied patients with early RA and those with later-stage RA (duration of <4 years and 4-9 years, respectively). We performed simulation studies, using the interrelationship of ACR core set measures in the trials to generate multiple trial data sets consistent with the original data.; The data-driven outcomes had greater power than did the a priori measures. The DMARD comparison was more powerful in early disease than in later-stage disease (the sample sizes needed to achieve 80% power for the most powerful test were 64 for early disease versus 100 for later disease), but the coxib-versus-placebo comparison was less powerful in early disease than in later disease (the sample sizes needed to achieve 80% power were 200 and 100, respectively). When the effects of treatment on core set items were small and/or inconsistent, power was reduced, particularly for a less broadly based outcome (e.g., DDAS) compared with the ACR20.; The simulation studies demonstrate that data-driven outcome definitions can provide better sensitivity to change than does the ACR20 or DDAS. Using such methods would improve power, but at the expense of trial standardization. The studies also show how patient population and treatment characteristics affect the power of specific outcome measures in RA clinical trials, and provide quantification of those effects.",2,E

At week 6, celecoxib was associated with a 34-mm mean improvement on the VAS for OA pain, compared with 31.6 mm for rofecoxib and 21.2 mm for placebo. The difference between celecoxib and rofecoxib was -2.5 mm, with an upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of 2.7 mm and within the prespecified definition of noninferiority. Secondary measures of efficacy showed similar results. All differences in primary and secondary measures of efficacy between the 2 active treatments and placebo were statistically significant (P < 0.02), whereas all of the comparisons of efficacy between celecoxib and rofecoxib met the predefined criteria for noninferiority. All treatments were well tolerated throughout the study, with similar proportions of patients withdrawing due to adverse events.; Celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day are equally efficacious in treating the signs and symptoms of OA.",I,I

Triple therapy consisted of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory, a local anesthetic field block, and an N-methyl-D-aspartate inhibitor before incision. The treatment group (n = 17) received rofecoxib, 50 mg PO, a field block with 0.25% bupivacaine/0.5% lidocaine, and ketamine 0.2 mg/kg IV before incision; controls (n = 17) received a placebo PO before surgery. The anesthetic protocol was standardized. Postoperative pain was treated by fentanyl IV and oxycodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg PO as required for pain. Pain scores (0-10) and analgesic were recorded for the first 7 days after surgery. Pain scores were 47% lower in the treatment group before discharge (3.1 +/- 0.6 versus 5.9 +/- 0.6, P = 0.0026) (mean +/- SE) and 18% less in the first 24 h after discharge (5.6 +/- 0.4 versus 6.8 +/- 0.5, P = 0.05); oral analgesic use was 34% less in the treatment group (4.6 +/- 0.8 doses versus 7.1 +/- 0.7 doses, P = 0.02) in the first 24 h after surgery. We conclude that triple preincisional therapy diminishes pain and analgesic use after outpatient hernia repair, and encourage further evaluation of this technique.; Outpatients undergoing inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia report moderate-to-severe pain after surgery. Triple preincisional therapy that included rofecoxib, 50 mg PO, ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg IV, and local anesthetic field block reduced pain scores and analgesic use in the first 24 h after discharge.",4,E

They were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg of oral rofecoxib or placebo before TRUS biopsy. After the biopsies, the patients were asked to score the severity of pain by filling out a visual analog pain scale. At the end of 1 week, all patients were asked to mail in a questionnaire regarding the morbidity of the prostate biopsy, including dysuria, hematuria, urinary retention, postbiopsy fever, and rectal bleeding. Analysis was completed to assess whether rofecoxib decreased the patients' perception of pain. The postbiopsy morbidity of patients receiving placebo versus rofecoxib was compared.; Thirty-seven percent of patients receiving placebo and 42% of patients receiving rofecoxib had significant pain (5 or greater on the visual analog pain scale). The median pain score of patients receiving rofecoxib (4.0) versus placebo (4.0) was not significantly different statistically (P = 0.3139) using a Wilcoxon rank sum analysis. The incidence of postbiopsy morbidity was not different.; Our results confirm the findings of previous studies demonstrating that a significant proportion of patients undergoing prostate biopsies have pain. More importantly, we found that prebiopsy rofecoxib did not significantly decrease the patients' severity of discomfort.

Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents (at present corticosteroids, cromoglycate and nedocromil) are the first-line treatment for this condition. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and indomethacin, however, have never been used in this setting, mainly for fear of adverse effects (e.g. severe obstructive reactions); these can occur, in a consistent number of patients as a consequence (according to the most widely accepted theory) of inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. In a double-blind crossover placebo-controlled study involving 20 aspirin-sensitive patients with asthma, we found that oral nimesulide 100mg was well tolerated both clinically and functionally (no significant changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second and specific airway resistance after drug intake). In a more recent study, we observed a mild obstructive reaction (easily controlled with inhaled bronchodilators) after oral administration of nimesulide 400mg to 3 patients who had previously tolerated a 100mg dose. On the basis of clinical experience, nimesulide (unlike most other NSAIDs) in the recommended doses appears to be well tolerated in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.

We have evaluated the effects of single and repeated doses of nimesulide on renal haemodynamics and electrolyte excretion in 8 healthy volunteers during a prolonged course of furosemide (frusemide). Under these study conditions, renal prostaglandin synthesis is expected to be elevated, with renal function being dependent upon increased levels of prostaglandins. Nimesulide induced an acute but transient decrease in indices of renal haemodynamics. Furosemide-induced increases in plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels were blunted, and urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 was markedly reduced by nimesulide. The magnitude and time course of the natriuretic, kaliuretic and diuretic effects of furosemide were attenuated by nimesulide. Although the transient nature of the observed renal haemodynamic changes suggests that the risk of developing acute renal failure is small, the rise should be taken into account in patients with renal dysfunction. Sodium and potassium retention, and the blunting of the diuretic-induced electrolyte excretion, could be of clinical relevance. Nimesulide appears, therefore, to share the prostaglandin-dependent renal effects of other NSAIDs.",E,E

Mean serum digoxin concentrations remained within the normal therapeutic range throughout the study despite large interindividual variation. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the morning and afternoon serum digoxin concentrations and there was no major change in the clinical condition of any patient. These results indicate that short term administration (7 days) of conventional therapeutic doses of nimesulide (100mg twice daily) does not modify the serum digoxin profile in patients with low class heart failure treated with a maintenance dose (0.25 mg/day) of this cardiac glycoside.",E,E

The study comprised three treatment periods. First, furosemide (40 mg) was administered as a single oral daily dose for 3 days. A wash-out day was followed by the administration of meloxicam (15 mg) as a single oral daily dose for 10 days. Thereafter, meloxicam and furosemide were administered concomitantly at the same doses as described above, for 3 days. The effect of concomitant ingestion of meloxicam and furosemide on furosemide-induced diuresis, urine and serum electrolytes, and furosemide pharmacokinetics was determined, after both single and repeated administration of furosemide. Estimates of the ""(furosemide+meloxicam)/(furosemide alone)"" mean ratio of the variable AUC(0-infinity) for plasma furosemide and the cumulative sodium excretion (0-8 h) were 97.4% (90% confidence interval 89.7-106%) and 88% (90% confidence interval 82-94%), respectively. The study results indicate that meloxicam does not affect the pharmacokinetics of furosemide in healthy volunteers, nor does it affect furosemide-induced diuresis or serum electrolytes. The cumulative urinary electrolyte excretion after concomitant administration of meloxicam and furosemide is somewhat lower than after administration of furosemide alone, in particular for the period 0-8 h after administration of furosemide. This effect of meloxicam on furosemide dynamics is small, and is probably not clinically relevant in healthy volunteers under the dosing regime studied.",E,E

Compared to controls, cholestyramine accelerated the elimination of meloxicam. The mean terminal phase elimination half-life was reduced from 19.5 h to 12.7 h due to an increase in clearance of the drug (0.426 vs 0.636 l.h-1). Also, as a consequence of increased clearance in the presence of cholestyramine, the mean residence time of the drug in the body was significantly decreased (39%) P < 0.01. However, the volume of distribution for meloxicam was largely unaffected by cholestyramine which suggests that meloxicam undergoes gut recirculation. These changes are of the same magnitude as those previously reported for the structurally related piroxicam and are much smaller than those observed for tenoxicam.",E,E

Six women with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea were treated with placebo, nimesulide or naproxen (500 mg, single oral dose) during three consecutive cycles. Uterine impedance (pulsatile index, PI) was measured during the cycle day 1 at four different levels of the uterus and in the ovarian branch of the uterine artery at 0, 30, 60, and 120-140 min, with a color Doppler ultrasonograph for orientation and with pulsatile Doppler for recording waveforms.; In the eumenorrheic women no significant changes were found with any treatment. In dysmenorrheic patients, nimesulide relieved symptoms and caused a decrease in uterine artery PI earlier than naproxen. Both treatments reduced the elevated uterine impedance in dysmenorrhea close to the normal level. When analyzing the PIs of the uterine artery at 4 different levels, the most prominent changes were observed in the fundus. The ovarian branch remained unaffected.; Color Doppler ultrasonography and pulsatile Doppler are good methods for investigating disease- or drug-induced changes in uterine and ovarian blood flow velocities. Nimesulide induced a slightly faster and more complete decrease of the elevated uterine vascular resistance in dysmenorrhea, towards normal eumenorrheic levels, than naproxen.

NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane. Two forms of COX have been identified--COX-1, which is constitutively expressed in most tissues and organs, and the inducible enzyme, COX-2, which has been localized primarily to inflammatory cells and tissues. In an animal model of acute inflammation (injection of carrageenan into the footpad), edema was produced that was associated with marked accumulation of COX-2 mRNA and thromboxane. A selective inhibitor of COX-2 (SC-58125) inhibited edema at the inflammatory site and was analgesic but had no effect on PG production in the stomach and did not cause gastric toxicity. These data suggest that selective inhibition of COX-2 may produce superior antiinflammatory drugs with substantial safety advantages over existing NSAIDs.",E,E

Meta-analyses of these variables were done for all randomized, controlled trials; for all randomized, uncontrolled trials; and for several subgroups.; When pooled, NSAIDs elevated supine mean blood pressure by 5.0 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.2 to 8.7 mm Hg) but had no effect on variables other than blood pressure. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs antagonized the antihypertensive effect of beta-blockers (blood pressure elevation, 6.2 mm Hg; CI, 1.1 to 11.4 mm Hg) more than did vasodilators and diuretics. Among NSAIDs, piroxicam produced the most marked elevation in blood pressure (6.2 mm Hg; CI, 0.8 to 11.5 mm Hg), whereas sulindac and aspirin had the least hypertensive effect.; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may elevate blood pressure and antagonize the blood pressure-lowering effect of antihypertensive medication to an extent that may potentially increase hypertension-related morbidity.

With respect to the total effect of a single oral dose, the anti-exudative effect of meloxicam on carrageenan-induced oedema in the rat exceeded that of all the NSAIDs included in the comparison. Additionally, meloxicam showed the greatest potency of all the compounds examined with respect to adjuvant-induced arthritis in the rat, the granuloma pouch model and the cotton pellet test in the rat. Unlike indomethacin, in the carrageenan pleurisy model in the rat, meloxicam caused both a dose-dependent reduction in exudate volume and also inhibition of leucocyte migration. Meloxicam showed a strong and lasting effect on inflammatory pain in the rat. Like other NSAIDs, but unlike dipyrone, meloxicam had no effect in the hot plate and tail clamp tests, which are used to identify weak central analgesic effects. Unlike dipyrone and like indomethacin, meloxicam had no effect in a model of visceral distention pain. In common with other NSAIDs, meloxicam had no influence on the body temperature of normothermic rats in the anti-inflammatory dose range, but did reduce yeast-induced fever in the rat in a dose-dependent manner. Like piroxicam, meloxicam had a uricosuric effect on rats treated with oxonic acid. Low-dose meloxicam inhibited both bradykinin-induced and PAF-induced bronchospasm in the guinea-pig, but had no effect on acetylcholine-induced bronchospasm. Piroxicam had greater ulcerogenic effects in the rat stomach than meloxicam.

A double-blind parallel-group trial compared meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily (n = 199) with naproxen 750 mg (n = 180) in rheumatoid arthritis. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the primary efficacy variables (global efficacy assessment by patient and investigator, number of painful/tender and swollen joints) and eight of the ten secondary efficacy endpoints. Only the swollen joint severity index and the number of discontinuations due to lack of efficacy favoured naproxen 750 mg significantly over meloxicam 7.5 mg. Meloxicam was better tolerated in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with fewer GI adverse events in the meloxicam-treated group (30.3%) than in the naproxen-treated group (44.7%), where two patients developed ulcers. No ulcers were seen in meloxicam patients. Significantly more patients discontinued due to GI adverse events in the naproxen group. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in haemoglobin and a significant increase in serum creatinine and urea in the naproxen group compared with the meloxicam group. In conclusion, meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily is a promising treatment in rheumatoid arthritis, with efficacy comparable to naproxen 750 mg. Meloxicam has the advantage of a significantly lower incidence of GI and renal side effects.",I,I

Three hundred and thirty-six patients were treated with oral meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily or diclofenac 100 mg slow release once daily for 6 months. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups with respect to overall pain, pain on movement, global efficacy or quality of life scores at the end of treatment, all of which showed good levels of improvement. Sixty-six patients were withdrawn after the start of the double-blind phase due to adverse events (n = 21, meloxicam; n = 31, diclofenac) or to lack of efficacy (seven in each group). The median of dose paracetamol taken concomitantly was statistically significantly lower in the meloxicam group than in the diclofenac group (185 vs 245 mg/day; P = 0.0123) with a comparable proportion of patients taking concomitant paracetamol therapy in both groups. Both drugs were well tolerated, although severe adverse events, treatment withdrawal and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were more common with diclofenac than with meloxicam. Thus, meloxicam 7.5 mg is a safe and effective treatment for OA of the hip and knee which demonstrates a trend towards an improved safety profile compared with diclofenac.",I,I

Plasma renin and aldosterone were determined on Days 2 and 9, with the subject supine, after 1 h of rest in the sitting position following 1 h of walking, and 3 h after oral intake of 40 mg furosemide, also in the sitting position. Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected on Days 1 and 8 for the measurement of the electrolytes, aldosterone pH1 and the urinary prostaglandins PGE2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TxB2.; After the first day of treatment with 25 mg b.d. flosulide, the increase in body weight was close to significance (0.86 vs -0.08 kg with placebo). A dose- and time-dependent decrease in both active and inactive plasma renin were observed, whereas the fall in plasma and urinary aldosterone was statistically significant only after the higher dose of flosulide. These changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were observed in the absence of oedema. Two out of eight volunteers experienced a strong and immediate reduction in the excretion of prostaglandins but overall the two doses tested did not produce a statistically significant inhibition in renal prostaglandins, especially following repeated dosing. The inhibitory effect of flosulide on renal prostaglandin synthesis was found to be less pronounced after repeated treatment, as documented on Day 9 by the lower inhibition of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TxB2.; These two studies in normal volunteers, in spite of some methodological limitations, were helpful in order to select doses of flosulide which should be effective and safe in patients during Phase II trials, by examining the inhibitory effect of the drug on renin synthesis and renal prostaglandin synthesis.",E,E

The onset of amnesia has a delay of 2 h post-training. To investigate if this effect is due to the inhibition of induction of the enzyme during learning, the release of cyclooxygenase products into the extracellular fluid was measured at 1, 2 and 3 h post-training. A cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, inhibited the training-dependent increase of cyclooxygenase products only 2 h and 3 h after learning when injected pre-training, as did dexamethasone which prevents cyclooxygenase induction, and SC58125 (1,2-diarylcyclopentene), an inhibitor of inducible cyclooxygenase. Injections 30 min post-training showed the same effect with the exception of dexamethasone. Injecting SC58125, ibuprofen, indomethacin, or dexamethasone i.c. before training showed amnesic effects for training on a one-trial passive avoidance task at 2 h but not 1 h after training.

To examine the relationship between change of CRP and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) over a 24 mo period to define the sensitivity of HAQ to change.; A prospective study of 109 consecutive patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA and had elevated CRP before steroid or 2nd line therapy. A full clinical assessment including HAQ was performed at presentation and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo. On the basis of the change in CRP at 6 mo, patients were divided into 3 groups: (1) CRP suppression to normal, (2) 50% reduction in CRP, and (3) less than 50% CRP change.; The 3 groups were clinically and immunologically similar at onset. At 6 mo the median HAQ fell to 5 (lower to upper quartiles 7.5 to 19) in Group 1 (CRP normalized, n = 34), 6 (3.75 to 10) in Group 2 (CRP reduced by 50%, n = 30), and 12 (6 to 18) in Group 3 (less than 50% CRP change, n = 44), p < 0.005 for Groups 1 and 2 versus Group 3. At 12 and 24 mo HAQ remained significantly lower in Groups 1 and 2 compared with Group 3. In Group 1, patients either maintained a normal CRP (n = 28) or their CRP became elevated (n = 6). Only in those patients in whom a re-elevation of the CRP occurred was deterioration in HAQ subsequently seen.; Suppression of elevated CRP in patients with active RA is associated with improvement in functional score, whereas persistent elevation of CRP is associated with functional deterioration. Once abnormal CRP is suppressed, no functional deterioration is likely to occur without re-elevation in CRP. Therefore, elevated CRP provides a convenient short term correlation with functional outcome and can be used as a guide for therapy. A HAQ score is a sensitive indicator of change in early disease.",I,3

GI adverse events were reported by 11, 11, and 16% of patients in the placebo, meloxicam 7.5 mg, and meloxicam 15 mg groups, respectively.

Warfarin was administered in an individualized dose to achieve a stable reduction in prothrombin times calculated as International Normalized Ratio (INR) values. Then INR- and a drug concentration-time profile was determined. For the interaction phase, meloxicam was added for 7 days and then INR measurements and the warfarin drug profiles were repeated for comparison. Overall, warfarin treatment lasted for 30 days.; Warfarin and meloxicam were well tolerated by healthy volunteers in this study. Thirteen healthy volunteers with stable INR values entered the interaction phase. Prothrombin times, expressed as mean INR values, were not significantly altered by concomitant meloxicam treatment, being 1.20 for warfarin alone and 1.27 for warfarin with meloxicam cotreatment. R- and S-warfarin pharmacokinetics were similar for both treatments. Geometric mean (% gCV) AUCss values for the more potent S-enantiomer were 5.07 mg.h.l-1 (27.5%) for warfarin alone and 5.64 mg.h.l-1 (28.1%) during the interaction phase. Respective AUCss values for R-warfarin were 7.31 mg.h.l-1 (43.8%) and 7.58 mg.h.l-1 (39.1%).; The concomitant administration of the new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) meloxicam affected neither the pharmacodynamics nor the pharmacokinetics of a titrated warfarin dose. A combination of both drugs should nevertheless be avoided and, if necessary, INR monitoring is considered mandatory.",4,E

NSAIDs with high affinity and specifity for Cox-2 hold the promise of maintaining efficacy without the gastrointestinal side effects of conventional NSAIDs.; We assessed the gastrointestinal tolerability of flosulide (20 mg twice a day), a highly selective Cox-2 inhibitor with that of naproxen (500 mg twice a day), which has equal affinity for Cox-1 and -2 in 19 patients with osteoarthrosis in a randomized, double blind, crossover endoscopy study. Subjects were treated for 2 weeks with a 2-week washout period. Gastroduodenal damage was primarily assessed as by Lanza (grades 0-4).; No stomach damage was seen in 13 (68%) patients after flosulide and in 5 (37%) after naproxen (P < 0.001).

9074838,Drug treatment of rheumatic diseases in the 1990s. Achievements and future developments.,Antirheumatic Agents; Forecasting; Humans; Rheumatic Diseases,"Choy, E H; Scott, D L","There have been several advances in the therapy of arthritis. These are based on better understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases, re-evaluation of previous therapeutic concepts such as combination therapy, and developments within biotechnology. There are 4 main areas of development, mainly involving the treatment of inflammatory synovitis. The first is with anti-inflammatory drugs, where there has been a focus on reducing gastrointestinal toxicity through the use of combination preparations such as diclofenac-misoprostol, and the introduction of drugs with more selectivity for cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibition such as meloxicam. An additional approach has been the development of anti-inflammatory drugs such as tenidap which also control cytokine metabolism. The second area is slow-acting antirheumatic drugs with the introduction of cyclosporin as a single agent or in combination with methotrexate, the development of immunomodulating drugs such as leflunomide, and the demonstration that some antibiotics such as minocycline have slow-acting effects. The third area is the use of corticosteroids including the development of deflazacort as a bone sparing agent, the greater use of intramuscular depot steroids and the validation of low-dose oral corticosteroids in early rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, there have been advances in the biotechnology area with the demonstration that cytokine immunotherapy such as antibodies to tumour necrosis factor can rapidly improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and that T cell immunotherapy with antibodies to the CD4 receptor may be effective in reducing synovitis. Many of these agents have not yet been introduced into clinical practice but they show the diversity of drug development and suggest the likelihood of major therapeutic benefits in the next few years.",E,E

The basic clinical pharmacokinetics of meloxicam (7.5-30 mg) have been investigated in 78 healthy male volunteers after single and multiple dosing via oral, intravenous and rectal routes. Plasma concentrations of meloxicam were determined by validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. The pharmaco-kinetic profile of meloxicam is characterized by almost complete absorption over a prolonged phase-avoiding high initial drug concentrations- and is bound to plasma proteins by more than 99.5%. Meloxicam is metabolized to four biologically inactive metabolites and excreted in urine and faeces with an elimination half-life (t1/2) of around 20 h. This is reflected in a total plasma clearance of 7 to 8 ml/min. Steady state is achieved within 3 to 5 days. In addition, the pharmacokinetic parameters are linear over the entire dose range, there are no changes with multiple dosing and bioequivalence was shown for a number of different formulations. The results indicate that meloxicam is suitable for once-daily administration and that a switch from one formulation to another is easily possible if necessary or convenient for the patient.",E,E

Records of all community deaths attributed to upper gastrointestinal diagnoses (with the same ICD codes) were also surveyed. Matched controls were identified from emergency admissions not caused by upper gastrointestinal diagnoses. The proportions of patients taking NSAIDs on admission to hospital (or at the time of death at home) and the outcome following admission to hospital were analysed.; 620 emergency upper gastrointestinal admissions were identified and matched with 460 controls. Cases were more likely to be NSAID users than Controls (31% vs. 16%, OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.8, 3.3: P < 0.001). Case NSAID use was higher in females and with increasing age. As severity of mode of presentation worsened, the probability of NSAID use increased (e.g. OR relative to controls for peptic pain 1.9, for perforation 5.9). Blood transfusion requirements were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in Cases taking NSAIDs, although NSAID use did not influence mortality. Extrapolation from these data indicate that there are 65,000 emergency upper gastrointestinal admissions per annum in UK; 12,000 of these admissions (including 2230 deaths) are attributable to NSAID use.

It has recently been postulated that NSAIDs' antiinflammatory efficacy arises from inhibition of the COX-2 isoform of cyclooxygenase, whereas inhibition of the COX-1 isoform produces the troublesome and sometimes serious gastric and renal side effects of NSAIDs. A relatively selective COX-2 inhibitor, such as meloxicam, may combine antiinflammatory efficacy with improved tolerability. In volunteers, indomethacin 75 mg, but not meloxicam 7.5 mg, inhibited renal prostaglandin E2 excretion and platelet aggregation (COX-1 mediated effects). Double-blind, randomized trials in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients have shown equivalent antiinflammatory efficacy among meloxicam 7.5 mg or 15 mg and diclofenac 100 mg, naproxen 750 mg, and piroxicam 20 mg. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, meloxicam (7.5 or 15 mg) caused less endoscopically detected gastrointestinal (GI) damage (Lanza scale) than piroxicam 20 mg. The MELISSA study, a double-blind, randomized, 28-day trial in over 9,000 patients showed that meloxicam 7.5 mg caused statistically less total GI toxicity, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea than diclofenac 100 mg, despite equivalent reductions in pain on movement for each treatment. A global safety analysis of clinical trials, representing over 5,600 patients and comprising 170 and 1,100 patient-years of exposure for meloxicam 7.5 mg and 15 mg, respectively, showed that meloxicam caused less GI toxicity and fewer peptic ulcers and GI bleeds than naproxen, diclofenac, or piroxicam. The renal safety profile and incidence of liver function abnormalities with meloxicam is equivalent to other NSAIDs available for clinical use. In conclusion, relatively selective COX-2 inhibition exemplified by meloxicam may offer effective symptom relief with an improved GI tolerability profile.",I,5

In rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy, the plasma exudation rate peaked at 5 h, at which time COX-2 was detectable in cells from the pleural exudate. Meloxicam and piroxicam (1 and 3 mg/kg) and NS-398 (3 mg/kg) showed almost equal anti-inflammatory potency against 5-hour pleurisy. A single oral administration of the compounds caused a dose-dependent increase in the number of rats with gastric mucosal erosion. The ED50 value for meloxicam (5.92 mg/kg) was significantly higher than that for piroxicam (1.76 mg/kg), indicating that meloxicam is safer. Indometacin showed intermediate safety (2.59 mg/kg). In in vitro experiments, indometacin inhibited COX-1 about 1.7 times more potently than COX-2. NS-398 inhibited COX-2 with an IC50 of 0.32 microM, but never affected COX-1 activity, even at 100 microM. In the same assay system, meloxicam inhibited COX-2 about 12 times more selectively than COX-1. Piroxicam, however, inhibited both isoforms almost equally. These results indicate that meloxicam is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with low gastric toxicity. One reason for its in vivo pharmacological profile may be related to its relative selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1. Thus, meloxicam may belong to a group of COX-2 selective anti-inflammatory agents with a better safety profile than conventional COX-1 and COX-2 nonselective anti-inflammatory agents.",E,E

Instillation of 20% ethanol (1 ml, p.o.) effectively protected against gastric mucosal injury induced by subsequent instillation of 70% or 96% ethanol (1 ml, p.o.). 3. Oral administration of indomethacin (1.25-20 mg kg[-1]) dose-dependently counteracted the protective effect of 20% ethanol (ID50: 3.5 mg kg[-1]). 4. Likewise, NS-398 (0.1-1 mg kg[-1]), L-745,337 (0.2-2 mg kg[-1]) and DFU (0.02-0.2 mg kg[-1]) inhibited the protective effect of 20% ethanol in a dose-dependent manner with ID50 values of 0.3 mg kg(-1), 0.4 mg kg(-1) and 0.06 mg kg(-1), respectively. 5. Inhibition of mild irritant-induced protection was also found when NS-398 (1 mg kg[-1]) was administered s.c. or when 96% ethanol was used to damage the mucosa. 6. Pretreatment with 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin (PG)E2 at 4 ng kg(-1), a dose that did not protect against ethanol (70%)-induced mucosal damage when given alone, completely reversed the effect of the selective COX-2 inhibitors on the mild irritant-induced protection. 7. Pretreatment with dexamethasone (3 mg kg(-1), 24 and 2 h before instillation of 20% ethanol) did not affect the protective activity of the mild irritant, indicating that enzyme induction is not involved. 8. Indomethacin (20 mg kg(-1), p.o.) did not prevent the protection conferred by sodium salicylate (100 mg kg[-1]), dimercaprol (30 microg kg[-1]), iodoacetamide (50 mg kg[-1]) and lithium (20 mg kg[-1]). Likewise, the protective effect of these agents was not counteracted by NS-398 (1 mg kg(-1), p.o.). 9.

The findings show that selective COX-2 inhibitors, although lacking in ulcerogenic activity, prevent the protection conferred by a mild irritant. Prostaglandis generated by a constitutive COX-2 could thus contribute to physiological functions involved in gastric homeostasis, although at present a non-COX-2-related mechanism underlying the effect of the selective COX-2 inhibitors tested on mild irritant-induced protection cannot be completely excluded.",E,E

The hydroalcoholic extract and it's fractions (aqueous and ethanolic) inhibited carrageenan-induced edema. However, only the ethanolic fraction was used in the other experiments due to it's yield. The extract also inhibited the cotton pellet granuloma and the increase of vascular permeability induced by histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and prostaglandin E2, but not that produced by bradykinin. The extract or the fraction did not present analgesic activity in the writhing test using acetic acid and did not reduce croton oil-induced ear edema in mice. When the ethanolic fraction and LPS were administered i.p. to Balb/C mice 72 h before blood or peritoneal fluid collection, no changes were observed in the white or total blood cell counts in the peripheral blood. On the other hand, changes were observed in both total and differential cell counts in the peritoneal exudate since all doses of the fraction reduced the number of total leukocytes (mainly lymphocytes) obtained from the peritoneal exudate. In contrast to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the administration of the hydroalcoholic extract or the ethanolic fraction alone did not potentiate gastric mucosal lesions induced by aspirin. The extract and the fraction inhibited the appearance of gastric lesions induced by indomethacin, ethanol and pylorus ligature, but not those induced by stress. As also observed with carbenoxolone, the ethanolic fraction increased the wall mucus in hypothermical-restraint stress-induced gastric lesions. The anti-ulcerogenic effect of the extract and of the ethanolic fraction may be related to an increase of mucosal defensive factors, such as prostaglandin and mucus. The anti-inflammatory actions of the extract and the fraction may be due to an inhibitory effect on histamine and cyclooxygenase II, but not on cyclooxygenase I, because the extract and it's fraction present both anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerogenic effects. The major substances present in the ethanolic fraction are flavonoids which will be isolated and identified.",E,E

Damage to the oesophageal, gastric and duodenal mucosa was assessed, mucosal blood flow (MBF) measured at endoscopy and biopsies taken for prostaglandin content and microscopic assessment of damage before NSAID administration and during days 1, 7 and 28 of continued intake.; Maximal macroscopic gastric mucosal damage (median grade+IQR) occurred within 24 h of piroxicam administration, the damage score increasing from 0 to 2.5 (0-3) (P=0.02) at day 1 before falling to 2.0 (0-2) at day 7 and 0 (0-1) at day 28 with resolution of damage observed in six out of the seven subjects who sustained acute injury. No significant macroscopic gastric damage occurred in either of the two other groups although some minor damage was observed in seven subjects taking placebo and five taking meloxicam. There was a trend towards piroxicam causing more acute gastric damage than meloxicam (P=0.06). Baseline antral, body and duodenal MBF were similar in all three groups. No significant changes occurred in any of the groups on any of the visits. There were also no changes in gastric mucosal prostaglandin content in any group.; These observations suggest that meloxicam causes little acute damage to the upper gastrointestinal tract and piroxicam causes some acute gastric injury but such damage resolves in most subjects by 28 days.",E,E

The responsible COX-isoenzyme in man is unknown. Therefore, we assessed the effects of meloxicam, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, and indomethacin, an unselective inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2, on furosemide stimulated plasma renin activity (PRA).; In a randomized cross-over design 15 healthy female volunteers received no NSAID or meloxicam 7.5 mg/d for 6 days or indomethacin 25 mg tid for 2 days and 25 mg on the 3rd day. On the control day and on the last day of each treatment the following parameters were evaluated before and after furosemide 20 mg i.v.: PRA measured by RIA, urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) assessed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, urine volume and urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, and creatinine, and serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, and creatinine.; Furosemide led to a more than two-fold rise of PRA. Indomethacin as well as meloxicam had no significant effect on basal PRA but inhibited the furosemide-stimulated PRA increase. PGE2 excretion on the control day rose two-fold after furosemide. Meloxicam had no effect on basal PGE2 excretion, whereas indomethacin reduced this parameter by 30%. Both drugs inhibited the increase of urinary PGE2 after furosemide. No drug effects on urine flow nor on electrolytes and creatinine in serum and urine could be observed.; Meloxicam inhibited furosemide stimulated renin release, suggesting that in man COX-2 is responsible for prostaglandin synthesis mediating renin release.",4,E

Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme is the basis for both the efficacy and toxicity of NSAIDs. The discovery of two COX isoforms, constitutive COX-1 and inducible COX-2, has led to the hypothesis that selective inhibition of COX-2 will minimize the potential for GI toxicity without compromising efficacy. The Meloxicam Large-scale International Study Safety Assessment (MELISSA) trial reported here was therefore set up to investigate the tolerability of meloxicam, a preferential inhibitor of COX-2, compared to diclofenac. MELISSA was a large-scale, double-blind, randomized, international, prospective trial, conducted over 28 days in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis. Patients received either meloxicam 7.5 mg or diclofenac 100 mg slow release, the recommended doses for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Evaluation of the profile of adverse events was the main aim of the trial, together with assessment of efficacy. A total of 9323 patients received treatment (4635 and 4688 in the meloxicam and diclofenac groups, respectively). Significantly fewer adverse events were reported by patients receiving meloxicam. This was attributable to fewer GI adverse events (13%) compared to diclofenac (19%; P < 0.001). Of the most common GI adverse events, there was significantly less dyspepsia (P < 0.001), nausea and vomiting (P < 0.05), abdominal pain (P < 0.001) and diarrhoea (P < 0.001) with meloxicam compared to diclofenac. Five patients on meloxicam experienced a perforation, ulcer or bleed vs seven on diclofenac (not significant). No endoscopically verified ulcer complication was detected in the meloxicam group compared to four with diclofenac. There were five patient days of hospitalization in patients on meloxicam compared to 121 with diclofenac. Adverse events caused withdrawal from the study in 254 patients receiving meloxicam (5.48%) compared to 373 (7.96%) on diclofenac (P < 0.001). These differences were attributable to differences in reported GI adverse events (3.02% on meloxicam vs 6.14% on diclofenac; P < 0.001). Differences in efficacy, as assessed by visual analogue scales, consistently favoured diclofenac. In all instances, 95% confidence intervals did not cross zero, suggesting a statistically significant effect. However, differences were small (4.5-9.01% difference) and did not reach pre-determined levels of clinical significance. Nevertheless, significantly more patients discontinued meloxicam because of lack of efficacy (80 out of 4635 vs 49 out of 4688; P < 0.01). The MELISSA trial confirms earlier studies suggesting that meloxicam has a significantly improved GI tolerability profile in comparison with other NSAIDs, including diclofenac. These results may in part reflect the preferential COX-2 selectivity of meloxicam, although the dose and other aspects of tolerability may be important. These results may provide support for the hypothesis that selective inhibition of COX-2 relative to COX-1 might be an effective approach towards improved NSAID therapy.",I,I

Patients with exacerbation of osteoarthritis were treated with the recommended dose of meloxicam (7.5 mg) or piroxicam (20 mg) once daily for 28 days; 4320 patients were administered meloxicam and 4336 piroxicam. The incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in the meloxicam group (22.5%) compared with the piroxicam group (27.9%; P < 0.001), mainly due to the significantly lower incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events in the meloxicam than in the piroxicam group (10.3% vs 15.4%,; P < 0.001), while the efficacy of both drugs was equivalent. Individual GI events occurred significantly less often with meloxicam than piroxicam: dyspepsia (3.4% vs 5.8%; P < 0.001), nausea/vomiting (2.5% vs 3.4%; P < 0.05) and abdominal pain (2.1% vs 3.6%; P < 0.001). There were 16 patients with perforations, ulcerations or bleeding (PUBs) of the upper GI tract in the piroxicam group compared with seven in the meloxicam group (relative risk piroxicam:meloxicam = 1.4). Four PUBs were complicated (perforations or bleedings); none of these occurred in the meloxicam group (relative risk piroxicam:meloxicam = 1.9). The outcome of SELECT is consistent with that of the large-scale clinical trial of similar design and size which compared 7.5 mg meloxicam with 100 mg diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis, and with a previous global analysis of the safety of meloxicam. It adds further data to the proposed relationship between selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and improved GI tolerability of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",I,I

To examine selectivity of tolerated doses of an inhibitor of the inducible COX-2 in humans, we examined the effects of celecoxib on indices of COX-1-dependent platelet thromboxane (Tx) A2 and on systemic biosynthesis of prostacyclin in vivo. Volunteers received doses of 100, 400, or 800 mg of celecoxib or 800 mg of a nonselective inhibitor, ibuprofen. Ibuprofen, but not celecoxib, significantly inhibited TxA2-dependent aggregation, induced ex vivo by arachidonic acid (83 +/- 11% vs. 11. 9 +/- 2.2%; P < 0.005) and by collagen. Neither agent altered aggregation induced by thromboxane mimetic, U46619. Ibuprofen reduced serum TxB2 (-95 +/- 2% vs. -6.9 +/- 4.2%; P < 0.001) and urinary excretion of the major Tx metabolite, 11-dehydro TxB2 (-70 +/- 9.9% vs. -20.3 +/- 5.3%; P < 0.05) when compared with placebo. Despite a failure to suppress TxA2-dependant platelet aggregation, celecoxib had a modest but significant inhibitory effect on serum TxB2 4 hr after dosing. By contrast, both ibuprofen and celecoxib suppressed a biochemical index of COX-2 activity (endotoxin induced PGE2 in whole blood ex vivo) to a comparable degree (-93.3 +/- 2% vs. -83 +/- 6.1%). There was no significant difference between the doses of celecoxib on COX-2 inhibition. Celecoxib and ibuprofen suppressed urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 2,3 dinor 6-keto PGF1alpha. These data suggest that (i) platelet COX-1-dependent aggregation is not inhibited by up to 800 mg of celecoxib; (ii) comparable COX-2 inhibition is attained by celecoxib (100-800 mg) and ibuprofen (800 mg) after acute dosing; and (iii) COX-2 is a major source of systemic prostacyclin biosynthesis in healthy humans.",2,E
