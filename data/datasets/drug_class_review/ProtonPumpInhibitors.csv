10024259,Symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: double blind controlled study of intermittent treatment with omeprazole or ranitidine. The European Study Group.,Adult; Aged; Anti-Ulcer Agents; Double-Blind Method; Female; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Omeprazole; Ranitidine; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome,"Bardhan, K D; M眉ller-Lissner, S; Bigard, M A; Bianchi Porro, G; Ponce, J; Hosie, J; Scott, M; Weir, D G; Gillon, K R; Peacock, R A; Fulton, C","To assess intermittent treatment over 12 months in patients with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.; Randomised, multicentre, double blind, controlled study. Patients with heartburn and normal endoscopy results or mild erosive changes received omeprazole 10 mg or 20 mg daily or ranitidine 150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. Patients remaining symptomatic had omeprazole 10 mg or ranitidine dose doubled for another 2 weeks while omeprazole 20 mg was continued for 2 weeks. Patients who were symptomatic or mildly symptomatic were followed up for 12 months. Recurrences of moderate or severe heartburn during follow up were treated with the dose which was successful for initial symptom control.; Hospitals and primary care practices between 1994 and 1996.; 677 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.; Total time off active treatment, time to failure of intermittent treatment, and outcomes ranked from best to worst.; 704 patients were randomised, 677 were eligible for analyses; 318 reached the end of the study with intermittent treatment without recourse to maintenance antisecretory drugs. The median number of days off active treatment during follow up was 142 for the entire study (281 for the 526 patients who reached a treatment related end point). Thus, about half the patients did not require treatment for at least 6 months, and this was similar in all three treatment groups. According to outcome, 378 (72%) patients were in the best outcome ranks (no relapse or one (or more) relapse but in remission until 12 months); 630 (93%) had three or fewer relapses in the intermittent treatment phase. Omeprazole 20 mg provided faster relief of heartburn. The results were similar in patients with erosive and non-erosive disease.; Intermittent treatment is effective in managing symptoms of heartburn in half of patients with uncomplicated gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. It is simple and applicable in general practice, where most patients are seen.",I,E

Sixty-eight patients (61 males/7 females, aged 25 73 years) with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer were included. Gastrin and pepsinogen I levels were measured before and after treatment. Demographic factors including age, sex, smoking, ulcer healing and antral Helicobacter pylori colonization/clearance were analyzed, in order to measure their probable influences on serum gastrin and pepsinogen I levels.; Ulcer healing was seen in 92.6% of patients while 48 (70.6%) antral clearances were seen in 66 H. pylori colonized patients at the end of trial. Omeprazole monotherapy led to a marked elevation of serum gastrin (85.8 pg x ml(-1), SD 32.0 pg x ml(-1) vs 133.9 pg x ml(-1), SD 71.6 pg x ml(-1), P < 0.01), and pepsinogen I (111.0 ng x ml(-1), SD 36.7 ng x ml(-1) vs 253.6 ng x ml(-1) , SD 64.8 ng x ml(-1), P < 0.01) levels when measured on day 29. Only patients showing antral H. pylori clearance exhibited an influence on the magnitude of pepsinogen I elevation following omeprazole monotherapy (143.9%, SD 67.3% vs 78.6%, SD 51.2%, P < 0.01). Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of serum pepsinogen I variations were plotted on a receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The 140% increased pepsinogen I level yielded a maximum accuracy of 80% specificity or 50% sensitivity to predict antral H. pylori clearance.; Antral H. pylori clearance is at least partially responsible for the omeprzaole-induced hyperpepsinogenemia I. The magnitude of hyperpepsinogenemia I probably provides a non-invasive alternative for predicting H. pylori clearance.",E,E

The male to female ratio was 5:1. Of the patients 59.2% were up to 50 years of age, while 40.8% were above the age of 50 years. Of the patients 47% were admitted 24 hours after the onset of peritonitis. All these patients were surgically treated with simple closure of the perforation with omental patch. Nine patients expired leading to 7.5% mortality. The risk factors identified for mortality were age 60 years and above, presence of shock on admission and delayed presentation. The mortality is directly related to the number of risk factors present in a given patient. At the time of discharge the patients were advised to take orally famotidine 40 mg at bed time for a period of 8 weeks. Eighty-one patients could be followed up and Visick grading was done. Sixty-two patients were in grade I, 11 in grade II, 3 in grade III and 5 in grade IV. The results indicate that simple closure followed by drug therapy is acceptable treatment for perforated duodenal ulcer.",3,E

The ratio of the serum concentration of omeprazole to hydroxyomeprazole at 3 h postdose was determined and used as a measure of CYP2C19 activity. The CYP2C19 wild type (wt) gene and four mutant alleles associated with the poor metaboliser phenotype of (S)-mephenytoin, CYP2C19*2 in exon 5, CYP2C19*3 in exon 4, CYP2C19m4 in exon 9, and CYP2C19m3 in the initial codon were analysed.; In the healthy volunteer study there was complete concordance between genotype and phenotype. However, eight of the patients who had the EM genotype had a high value for their hydroxylation index, and were classified as phenotypic PMs. No CYP2C19m4 and CYP2C19m3 mutations were detected in the eight mismatched patients. They were all genotypic heterozygous EMs, elderly (> or = 65 years) and/or had hepatic disease. Therefore, impaired CYP2C19 activity combined with partial saturation of omeprazole metabolism during multiple dosing may have contributed to the discrepancy between CYP2C19 genotyping and phenotyping.; Although omeprazole has been used instead of mephenytoin as a probe for polymorphic CYP2C19, it does not appear to be reliable enough for clinical application in Japanese patients.",E,E

The aim of this study was to define the safety profile of lansoprazole and compare it to that of other therapeutic agents evaluated in the same controlled trials.; The clinical safety profile of lansoprazole and comparative agents (placebo, ranitidine and omeprazole) was reviewed for 3281 patients who participated in short term (up to 8 weeks) and long term (up to 56 months) clinical trials conducted in the US. Adverse events, laboratory value changes and gastric biopsy changes that occurred during treatment were compared statistically for differences between treatments.; The incidence of adverse events and number of patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events was similar for lansoprazole and comparative agents. Other than elevated serum gastrin levels, a known effect of proton pump inhibitors, no trends in laboratory changes were observed. Median values for gastrin levels remained within the normal range; about 2% of patients had gastrin levels >400 pg/ml at any time, while <1% had 2 or more gastrin values >500 pg/ml. Values returned to baseline levels after therapy was discontinued. No significant changes in gastric endocrine cell growth from baseline to final visit were observed, nor was there evidence of dysplasia or neoplasia.; Lansoprazole is well tolerated for both short and long term treatment of acid-related disease. The tolerability of lansoprazole is comparable to that of ranitidine, omeprazole and placebo in the treatment of these diseases.",I,E

The disease is common, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 25 to 35 percent in the U.S. population. GERD can usually be diagnosed based on the clinical presentation alone. In some patients, however, the diagnosis may require endoscopy and, rarely, ambulatory pH monitoring. Management includes lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapy; refractory disease requires surgery. The therapeutic goals are to control symptoms, heal esophagitis and maintain remission so that morbidity is decreased and quality of life is improved.",E,E

We therefore studied the effect of H. pylori eradication on basal and stimulated gastrin and PG levels for 1 year. Initially, the usefulness of measuring these parameters for the noninvasive diagnosis of H. pylori eradication was validated. Furthermore, an assessment was made of the association between H. pylori reinfection and a re-increase in gastrin and PG values. Finally, an evaluation was made of the variables influencing gastrin and PG concentration, with particular attention to H. pylori infection and histological lesions of gastric mucosa.; Two-hundred and twenty-two patients with duodenal ulcer were studied prospectively. Exclusion criteria were the administration of antibiotics, H2 antagonists, omeprazole or bismuth prior to endoscopy. In all patients serum basal levels of gastrin, PGI, and PGII were measured before and 1 month after completing eradication therapy. In the successfully eradicated patients, gastrin, PGI, and PGII were also measured at 6 and 12 months. In 80 patients stimulated measurements of gastrin (after ingestion of two beef cubes) and PGI (after injection of pentagastrin) were also performed. H. pylori-negative patients after therapy underwent a urea breath test at 6 and 12 months, and patients who had stimulated gastrin and PG concentration measured had also an endoscopy performed at 6 months.; H. pylori was eradicated in 73% of patients. A histological improvement was observed 1 month after completing H. pylori eradication therapy, both at gastric antrum and body (P < 0.001), while a further improvement at antrum was demonstrated at 6 months (P < 0.01). With regard to the different cut-off points for decreased basal and stimulated measurements for diagnosing H. pylori eradication, the best results were obtained, respectively, with PGII (sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 76%) and PGI 30 min after stimulation (sensitivity and specificity of 82%), with an area under the ROC curve of 0.87 in both cases. In the multiple regressions analysis H. pylori status correlated with gastrin, PGI and PGII after therapy (P < 0.001), while histological lesions correlated only with gastrin levels (P < 0.05). A decrease in basal and stimulated serum parameters was demonstrated immediately after eradication (Wilcoxon test, P < 0.001), and an additional decrease (at 6 months) was observed just in PGI (Friedman test, P < 0.01). However, gastrin and PGII values remained unchanged after the first month post-eradication. Seven patients were reinfected with H. pylori during follow-up. Quantitation of basal and stimulated gastrin and PGI levels was not reliable as a reinfection marker. Regarding basal PGII, the parallelism was strong at 6 months (re-increase in all four reinfected patients), although only in one out of three with reinfection at 1 year did PGII rise at that stage.; (1) Measurement of gastrin and PG levels (especially basal PGII values) is a useful non-invasive method to confirm H. pylori eradication after therapy. (2) H. pylori eradication is associated with a significant decrease in basal and stimulated gastrin levels and in basal PGII levels that is detected immediately (1 month) after finishing treatment, and remains unchanged for 1 year. However, the decrease in basal and stimulated PGI levels occurs progressively for 6 months, although such levels remain also unchanged afterwards. (3) Measurement of gastrin and PGI concentrations has a limited usefulness in the diagnosis of H. pylori reinfections after successful eradication, although PGII determination could be more useful in this situation.",E,E

A quarter of those prescribed ASDs between 1989 and 1993 had been endoscoped between 1978 and 1993. In those with a peptic diagnosis prescribed any ASD, the pathologies found were: oesophageal (42.9%), duodenal (36.3%) and gastro-pyloric (21.3%). Patients prescribed omeprazole were more likely to have undergone endoscopy than those prescribed other ASDs, and they were also more likely to have peptic oesophageal pathology. Long-term prescribing (>56 days per year) occurred in two-thirds of patients prescribed ASDs and 40% had at least one endoscopy. In those prescribed short-term ASDs, 20% had undergone at least one endoscopy.

When administered as maintenance therapy, omeprazole reduces the incidence of relapse.  The drug is also highly effective in patients poorly responsive to histamine H 2-receptor antagonists.  The daily acquisition cost of omeprazole is higher than that of histamine H 2-receptor antagonists in many countries, and thus it is important to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic impact of omeprazole in the short and long term treatment of duodenal ulcer and reflux oesophagitis.  Pharmacoeconomic analyses have been performed in several clinical settings using pooled data from clinical trials or simulated models of clinical practice.  In a single analysis using Finnish cost data, omeprazole was more cost effective than ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer disease over a 6-month period.  The cost effectiveness of omeprazole was comparable to that of sucralfate-containing regimens, with patients receiving omeprazole being healed more quickly and experiencing a greater number of healthy days.  Using a computer-model simulation and Swedish cost data, omeprazole was more cost effective than ranitidine when administered as intermittent treatment of duodenal ulcer over 5 years.  Preliminary reports indicate that regimens which eradicate Helicobacter pylori are more cost effective than those which do not.  As short term treatment of reflux oesophagitis, omeprazole 20 to 40 mg/day was the dominating treatment strategy, being less costly and more effective than ranitidine 300 to 1200 mg/day.  Omeprazole 20 mg/day produced symptom-free days more cost effectively than either cimetidine 1.6 g/day or ranitidine 300 mg/day.  More importantly, as long term (maintenance or intermittent) treatment of reflux oesophagitis, omeprazole 20 mg/day was more cost effective than both ranitidine 150 mg twice daily and 'phase 1' therapy (diet and antacids) over 6 and 12 months. Thus, based on analyses evaluated, omeprazole appears to be more cost effective than ranitidine in the short term treatment of duodenal ulcer. Results for long term treatment are less clear cut, but full details from some studies are not yet available.  For the short term treatment of reflux oesophagitis omeprazole is more cost effective than ranitidine or cimetidine and for long term treatment omeprazole is more cost effective than ranitidine.  As treatment for reflux oesophagitis, omeprazole is considered to be the dominating treatment strategy.",E,E

A previously constructed 7-month community practice decision analytical model was revised to include the latest published data on efficacy and symptomatic outcomes. The original results of phase I therapy (antacids plus dietary, sleeping and lifestyle changes) alone or combined with ranitidine 150mg bid or omeprazole 20mg od were reassessed by adding new clinical data on the efficacy of and symptomatic response to ranitidine 150mg qid. The same payment data used in the first analysis were applied here as well, with the addition of the US price of ranitidine 150mg qid. The study perspective was that of the payer or insurer. Omeprazole-based therapy remained a dominant strategy for symptomatic care during the 7-month model. It was 14% less costly per patient, led to 23% fewer symptomatic months, and had 21% lower cost per symptom-free month than ranitidine 150mg qid, the next best alternative. Evolving treatment strategies necessitate rapid assessment and reassessment so that clinical practice can remain current, patients can be assured of the best quality, and insurers can be aware of treatment cost and budgetary impact given limited resources in all countries. Only by consistent and continuous re-evaluation of new or changing medical interventions can clinicians and insurers adapt patient management to new scientifically derived results. This is the best manner by which to meet patients' care needs and the clinical needs of practitioners, as well as the financial needs of payers.",E,E

Of the patients entering the eradication strategy, most are cured and will have no relapse during a 5-year period. H. pylori eradication results in higher initial costs but, because of a very low risk of recurrence after successful eradication, the expected future costs are reduced. The investment pays off within 1 year when compared with maintenance treatment, and within 3 years when compared with episodic treatment.",E,E

The objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of 2 treatment strategies for patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer. Cost effectiveness was analysed for antisecretory therapy (omeprazole 20 mg/day for 4 weeks), and eradication therapy (triple therapy: omeprazole 40 mg/day plus clarithromycin 1 g/day plus amoxicillin 2 g/day for 1 week). In a Markov model, a hypothetical cohort of 5000 patients was followed for 10 years through 6 disease states. Cyclic eradication therapy (i.e. in the first duodenal ulcer episode and in relapses) was the most cost effective [21 Spanish pesetas (Pta) per day free of symptoms (DFS); Pta128 = $US1 (October 1995)] of the eradication options evaluated [antisecretory in the first episode, then eradication for relapses (Pta22.3/DFS), and eradication therapy first, then antisecretory therapy (Pta27.3/DFS)]. Antisecretory therapy alone was less cost-effective (Pta39/DFS) than each of the 3 eradication options. Eradication treatment in the first episode of duodenal ulcer and relapses has savings in direct costs per patient of up to 56% compared with antisecretory therapy alone. Sensitivity analyses showed the model to be very robust. It is, therefore, advisable to treat initial episodes of H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer and relapses with triple therapy. The improved cost-effectiveness ratio was largely explained by the long term reduction in relapses obtained with the eradication strategies.",E,E

While controlling symptoms and improving quality of life, NSAID use is associated with gastroduodenal injury and a 2%-4% annual risk for symptomatic gastroduodenal ulceration, hemorrhage, and perforation. This requires clinicians to balance the efficacy of NSAIDs against the potential risk of serious gastrointestinal events. Identification and stratification of risk can help guide the optimal approach for arthritis management of individual patients or large populations such as managed care organizations. NSAID-induced gastroenteropathy carries considerable economic consequences; 46% of arthritis costs are related to managing serious adverse events. It is reasonable to assume that these costs may not be incurred if high-risk patients are recognized and optimally managed. Newer therapies with proven safety margins present an attractive option, especially for patients at higher risk. The single-tablet formulations of diclofenac and misoprostol (Arthrotec) offer an alternative in managing NSAID patients because of their inherent safety profile. Studies with diclofenac/misoprostol indicate its effectiveness in treating signs and symptoms of arthritis and in reducing the incidence of NSAID-induced gastroenteropathy. As such, this agent may provide improved medical and economic outcomes. This review discusses the clinical aspects of NSAID-induced gastroenteropathy, including available preventive therapies. Approaches to assessing patients' risk for developing complications, and the relationship of medical risk and economic outcomes, are also examined. Although not all patients require preventive therapy, patients with heightened risk may benefit clinically and economically from gastroprotective NSAIDs. Additional research or modeling may provide further insight into the economic implications of managing and preventing NSAID-induced gastroenteropathy.",3,E

To suppress the pain and the inflammatory process, patients are often chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) users. Chronic use of NSAIDs may induce peptic ulcer, dyspeptic problems and heartburn. Therefore, these patients are often provided with treatment to relieve and/or protect against gastrointestinal problems. Rheumatic disorders also affect a range of health-related quality of life domains. In one study, patients with NSAID-associated gastroduodenal lesions complained about lack of energy, sleep disturbances, emotional distress and social isolation in addition to pain and mobility limitations. The degree of distress and dysfunction differed markedly from scores in an unselected population. Clinical trial data suggest that acid-suppressing therapy with omeprazole is superior to therapy with misoprostol and ranitidine in healing gastroduodenal lesions and preventing abdominal pain, heartburn and indigestion symptoms during continued NSAID treatment. Because arthritic patients are severely incapacitated by their condition regarding most aspects of health-related quality of life, it is important to offer a treatment that is effective in healing and preventing NSAID-induced ulcers and gastrointestinal symptoms during continued NSAID treatment without further compromising the patients' quality of life.

Evidence suggests that an intraesophageal pH of less than 4.0 directly correlates with the degree of mucosal injury. The advent of acid secretory inhibitors such as the histamine2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and, more recently, the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has revolutionized the treatment of patients with reflux disease. However, the evidence linking the degree of mucosal damage to pH of the refluxate has prompted investigators to reevaluate the effectiveness of these agents. The PPIs are significantly more effective than the H2RAs in achieving and sustaining an intragastric pH above 4.0.

At baseline and 6 weeks after the completion of treatment, clinical assessment, endoscopy with gastric biopsies, rapid urease test, 13C urea breath test, and serum laboratory analyses were performed. All patients were treated with pantoprazole 40 mg once daily, plus amoxycillin 1 gram tid and metronidazole 250 mg tid for 1 week, and pantoprazole 40 mg once daily for a second week. A clinical diary for daily assessment of symptoms and side effects was completed by patients during the treatment period.; Three patients were discontinued from the study. Six weeks after therapy, the ulcer was healed in 47 of 48 patients (97.9%, 95% CI = 93.9-100). The cure rates of H. pylori infection, expressed using both the intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses, were 80.4% (95% CI = 69.5-91.3) and 85.4% (95% CI = 75.4-95.4), respectively. The therapy led to a significant, rapid disappearance or reduction in daytime epigastric pain, from 68.8% on day 1 to 82.2% on day 3 (p < 0.001) and in nocturnal epigastric pain, from 80.6% on day 1 to 93.3% on day 3 (p < 0.001). After 2 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients completely free of pain was 82.2% for daytime pain and 90.3% for nocturnal pain. A rapid improvement in acid regurgitation, heartburn, nausea and vomiting was also observed with a median value of symptom disappearance of 2 days. The percentages of patients completely symptom-free were 37.5% after 1 day, 54.1% after 3 days, 75% after 2 weeks, and 83.3% after 2 months.

The initial recommendations of the conference were published in early 1998. An update meeting was held in June 1998, and the present paper updates and complements the earlier recommendations. Key changes included the following: the recommendation for testing and treating H pylori infection in patients with known peptic ulcer disease was extended to testing and treating patients with ulcer-like dyspepsia; it was decided that the urea breath test (not serology) should be used for routine diagnosis of H pylori infection unless endoscopy is indicated for another reason; and recommended therapies were a twice daily, seven-day regimen of a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole 20 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, pantoprazole 40 mg) or ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg, plus clarithromycin 500 mg and amoxicillin 1000 mg, or plus clarithromycin 500 or 250 mg and metronidazole 500 mg. The need was reiterated to have funding for readily accessible, accurate testing for H pylori infection with the urea breath test. It was strongly recommended that regional centres be established to monitor the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant H pylori infections. The initial consensus document referred to pediatric issues that were not addressed in this update but were the subject of a subsequent Canadian Helicobacter Study Group meeting, and will be published later in 1999.",E,E

Thirteen healthy men and 10 men with stable, compensated cirrhosis documented by biopsy or liver/spleen scan received a single 20-mg rabeprazole dose. Blood samples were drawn before and up to 24 hours after drug administration for the determination of plasma rabeprazole concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography. Adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical findings, and clinical laboratory test results were monitored before and during treatment to determine how rabeprazole was tolerated. Chronic liver disease substantially altered the pharmacokinetic profile of rabeprazole. The maximum rabeprazole concentration (+/- SD) in subjects with cirrhosis (635+/-199 ng/mL) was approximately 50% higher than that in the healthy volunteers (401+/-246 ng/mL), and both area under the curve and elimination half-life were increased by approximately 100%. Oral clearance in subjects with cirrhosis was 38% of that in the healthy volunteers. Rabeprazole was well tolerated by both groups. Three subjects reported a total of 5 clinical adverse events that were judged as definitely or possibly related to rabeprazole treatment. Some minor changes in laboratory values were judged to be clinically insignificant. In patients with mild-to-moderate liver dysfunction, clearance of this PPI, as with other members of the class, was markedly reduced and plasma levels were increased.

The studies presented have helped develop a clinical picture of the patients who may benefit from alternate-day therapy without risk of complications or potential increases in management costs. Bank et al., reporting on a group of patients, found that patients with Grade II-IV disease had a 61% success rate at two to eight years. Bank defined success as both maintenance of endoscopic healing and symptom control. Ladas et al. found a 66.7% success rate defined as clinical and endoscopic remission in Grades II-III disease. Kurucar et al. monitored symptom control and esophageal complications in his patients and found the regimen to have a 26% success rate in Grades III-IV disease. Lind et al. found that 83% of patients could remain symptom free with on-demand therapy if they were endoscopy-negative at baseline. The results of the Mantides et al. study are important because they imply that alternate-day omeprazole therapy may be more effective than alternatives for step-down treatment, such as ranitidine or cisapride. Furthermore, patients can be educated to increase their frequency of use if symptoms should arise. Not only does this give the patient a sense of self-empowerment over his or her disease state, but it avoids the cost of switching to a PPI due to failure with an H2RA or a motility agent. Alternate-day use of omeprazole should be attempted only during the maintenance phase of GERD therapy. Patients requiring >20 mg/d to achieve healing appeared to be poor candidates for alternate-day omeprazole maintenance therapy. Based on available studies, it would seem that patients with Grades 0-II GERD would benefit most from alternate-day therapy. A role for alternate-day therapy in Grades III-IV is apparent from the results presented but requires greater caution in view of the differing success rates (26-61%) in various studies. With Grades II-III esophagitis, a mean 24-hour gastric pH >6 and a gastric pH <4 less than 10% of the time during the initial healing phase with omeprazole 20 mg/d appeared to be associated with success on alternate-day therapy. Evidence that all marketed PPIs have similar success is not available and should not be extrapolated from the data presented. Evidence that downward dosage adjustments of PPIs versus extending dosage intervals are effective in the maintenance of GERD should be recognized. Lansoprazole has been approved for treating erosive esophagitis at 30 mg/d, with the maintenance dose established at 15 mg/d. Studies showing that lansoprazole 15 mg/d is more effective than alternate-day therapy with lansoprazole 30 mg exist, although similar studies with omeprazole have not been performed. The abstracts describing the use of alternate-day omeprazole accounted for all enrollees and included endoscopic grading or pH monitoring to document disease severity at baseline. Most also included these same objective measures as end points in combination with symptom control. This strengthens the data since the positive predictive value of typical symptoms is variable. However, there are also several significant limitations. Abstracts provide only limited information on methods. All studies other than Lind et al. lacked randomization. This study was also the only one that blinded patients to their treatment. Sample sizes for the majority of the trials were quite small. Statistical analyses were not performed on any of the trial results with the exception of the trial by Lind et al. In light of the lack of evidence of statistical significance as well as study design flaws, conclusions should be drawn cautiously. Larger well-designed trials looking at both the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of alternate day omeprazole are required before a definitive recommendation can be made.",E,E

All three doses also induced significant gastric injury, and 325 mg caused duodenal injury. Three subjects developed gastric ulcers, 1 while taking 10 mg/day of aspirin. Furthermore, aspirin at 81 mg/day and 325 mg/day (but not 10 mg/day) significantly reduced duodenal mucosal prostaglandin levels to approximately 40% of the baseline value. Only 325 mg of aspirin per day significantly reduced rectal mucosal prostaglandin levels to approximately 60% of the baseline value. Serum thromboxane levels were inhibited 62%, 90%, and 98% with 10, 81, and 325 mg of aspirin.; The findings explain aspirin's predominant gastric toxicity and question the safety of even 10 mg of aspirin daily.",E,E

The prevalence of metronidazole-resistant strains was 26.8% in our area. Colloidal bismuth pectin (CBP) is a new, lower-priced bismuth salt made in China. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of CBP triple and quadruple regimens in the treatment of H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer.; In this prospective trial, 205 patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer were allocated randomly to receive one of four regimens: metronidazole, 200 mg; amoxicillin, 250 mg; and colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), 120 mg (group 1), or CBP, 100 mg qid (group 2) for 2 weeks, then continued CBS, 240 mg, or CBP, 200 mg bid for a further 2 weeks. A quadruple regimen using a combination of omeprazole, 20 mg bid, and CBS triple therapy (group 3) or CBP triple therapy (group 4), respectively, was given to patients for 1 week, followed by omeprazole, 20 mg once daily for a further 3 weeks. Further endoscopy was performed at least 4 weeks after cessation of the treatment. H. pylori status was determined by histology, a 14C urea breath test, and a urease test.; The per-protocol H. pylori cure rates were 85% (22 of 26 patients), 90% (35 of 39), 96% (46 of 48), and 95% (75 of 79) for groups 1 through 4. In the intention-to-treat analysis, cure rates were 79% (22 of 28), 83% (35 of 42), 90% (46 of 51), and 89% (75 of 84), respectively. The cure rates of quadruple therapy were higher than those of triple therapy; an 8.2% difference was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-18.7%). The ulcer-healing rates were 88%, 87%, 98%, and 97%, respectively, for groups 1 through 4. The ulcer pain was relieved more rapidly in quadruple- than in triple-therapy regimens. Two patients discontinued treatment prematurely owing to drug-related side effects.; One-week quadruple therapy is highly effective and safe in H. pylori eradication in Chinese patients.

The mean (s.d.) number of study medications used per day in these groups was 0.43 (0.27), 0.41 (0.27) and 0.47 (0.27), respectively. The use of antacids was highest in the placebo group and lowest in the omeprazole 20 mg group. Treatment failure was associated with more than a doubling of antacid use, and a deterioration in patient quality of life.; Approximately 50% of patients with heartburn who do not have oesophagitis need acid inhibitory therapy in addition to antacid medication to maintain a normal quality of life. On-demand therapy with omeprazole 20 mg, is an effective treatment strategy in these patients.",I,E

It is unknown whether this is relevant for the treatment of GERD.; To compare oesophageal acid exposure and symptoms in H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive GERD patients during low and profound acid suppression.; Barrett's oesophagus patients with gastro- oesophageal acid reflux were studied by 24-h oesophageal pH-metry at baseline and during randomized treatment with omeprazole 40 mg b.d. or ranitidine 150 mg b.d. H. pylori status was determined by a serum IgG ELISA. Symptoms were scored on a four-graded scale.; Of 58 patients, 26 (14 H. pylori-negative, 12 H. pylori-positive) were randomized to omeprazole, 32 (16 H. pylori-negative, 16 H. pylori-positive) to ranitidine. At baseline, oesophageal acid exposure and symptoms did not differ between H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive: mean time proportion pH < 4 per 24 h was 16.1% (95% CI 11.5-23.2) in H. pylori-negative, and 15.8% (11.3-21.4) in H. pylori-positive patients. Omeprazole treatment resulted in a decrease of acid reflux per 24 h from 23.4% (7.9-39.3) to 0.0% (0.0-2.9) in H. pylori-negative, and from 17.3% (8.9-38.8) to 0.1% (0.0-1.7) in H. pylori-positive patients; ranitidine resulted in a decrease from 14.4% (10.5-18.5) to 9.3% (5.6-12.8) in H. pylori-negative, and from 15.1% (9.8-21.0) to 9.0% (3.1-20.1) in H. pylori-positive patients, the difference between H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive patients being N.S.

Entry criteria were 1) birth weight <1501 g; 2) age between 15 and 25 days; 3) <10% decrease in ventilator settings for 24 hours and FIO2 >/=0.3; 4) absence of patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, major congenital malformation, congenital heart disease; and 5) no evidence of maternal HIV or hepatitis B infection. The dosage schedule was 0.25 mg/kg bid for 3 days, then 0.15 mg/kg bid for 3 days, then a 10% reduction in the dose every 3 days until a dose of 0.1 mg/kg had been given for 3 days, from which time a dose of 0.1 mg/kg qod was continued until 42 days after entry. The primary endpoint was the number of days on assisted ventilation after study entry. Secondary outcomes of interest included days on supplemental oxygen, days of hospitalization, and potential adverse effects, such as infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, left ventricular hypertrophy, and severe retinopathy of prematurity.; Infants in the dexamethasone- and placebo-treated groups were similar in terms of baseline attributes, including birth weight, gestational age, gender, race, and ventilator settings at entry. Infants treated with dexamethasone were on assisted ventilation and supplemental oxygen for fewer days after study entry (median days on ventilator, 5th and 95th percentiles, 13 [1-64] vs 25 [6-104]; days on oxygen, 59 [6-247] vs 100 [11-346]). No differences were found in risk of death, infection, or severe retinopathy. In subgroup analyses, the association of dexamethasone with more rapid weaning from the ventilator was weaker among infants enrolled before the 16th day of life, infants with chest radiographs showing cystic changes and/or hyperinflation, and infants requiring an FIO2 >/=0.7 or a peak inspiratory pressure >/=19 at study entry.; A 42-day tapering course of dexamethasone decreases the duration of ventilator and oxygen dependency in very low birth weight infants and is not associated with an increased risk of short-term adverse effects.",3,E

NSAIDs cause gastrointestinal damage by 2 independent mechanisms: a topical effect, which is pH and pKa related, and a systemic effect mediated by cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition with a reduction in prostaglandin synthesis. Using endoscopy, gastroduodenal lesions identified include subepithelial haemorrhages, erosions and ulcers. The prevalence of ulceration in NSAID users has been reported as being between 14 and 31% with a 2-fold higher frequency of gastric ulcers compared with duodenal ulcers. Among the strategies used to decrease the risk of ulcer development are: (i) the use of analgesics other than NSAIDs; (ii) use of the lowest possible dosage of NSAID; (iii) the use of a COX-2 selective NSAID; (iv) the use of low doses of corticosteroids instead of NSAIDs; (v) avoidance of concomitant use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids; and (vi) use of preventive therapy. In an attempt to reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal lesions, the following approaches have been proposed: (i) use of the prostaglandin analogue misoprostol, which is an antiulcer drug which has been proven to be as effective in the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers as in the reduction of serious upper gastrointestinal complications; (ii) histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2 antagonists), e.g. ranitidine, cimetidine and famotidine, which are useful in the prevention of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcers during long term treatment, but not in the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers; (iii) proton pump inhibitors, e.g omeprazole, and pantoprazole, whose efficacy in preventing NSAID-associated ulcers has been recently demonstrated; and (iv) barrier agents, e.g. sucralfate, which cannot be recommended as prophylactic agents to prevent NSAID-induced gastropathy. The first step in the treatment of NSAID-associated ulcers lies in a reduction in the dosage of the NSAID or discontinuation of the drug. If NSAID treatment cannot be withdrawn, a proton pump inhibitor appears to be the most effective treatment in healing ulcers, accelerating the slow healing observed with H2 antagonists.",E,E

However, recent reports showed that Helicobacter pylori eradication may resolve peptic stenosis. Thus, we carried out a prospective study on a cohort of patients with peptic stenosis and H. pylori infection to evaluate the efficacy of anti- H. pylori therapy in the treatment of peptic stenosis.; From May 1995 to May 1998 we studied 22 consecutive patients with benign peptic stenosis (16 with duodenal stenosis and six with pyloric stenosis) and H. pylori infection. Searches for H. pylori were made at first diagnosis of peptic stenosis and at every endoscopic control. All patients were treated with an anti- H. pylori treatment (13 with omeprazole/clarithromycin/ metronidazole and nine with omeprazole/amoxycillin/ clarithromycin), followed by 8 weeks' therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor. Endoscopic controls were performed after the end of H. pylori-eradication therapy, at 2 and 6 months, and then every 6 months.; H. pylori eradication was achieved in all patients. Peptic stenosis disappeared completely in 20/22 cases (17/20 after 2 months and 3/20 after 6 months), and in all these patients the symptoms disappeared within 2 months. At the median follow-up of 12.4 months (range 2-24), the patients remained asymptomatic, without recurrence of the stenosis, and needed no medication. In one patient the stenosis disappeared partially and symptoms improved, and it was successfully treated with cisapride. In one patient the stenosis did not disappear despite H. pylori eradication and continuous proton-pump inhibitor treatment. The patient was treated with a liquid diet due to old age, but he died 4 months after H. pylori eradication due to stroke.; H. pylori eradication is a safe and effective therapy for peptic stenosis. Endoscopic balloon dilation or surgery should be used only after failure of this conservative treatment.",3,E

This is in line with their basic pharmacology which suggests that, primarily, the serum AUCs of the free pro-drugs and their chemical activation half lives at pH 1 relative to their serum elimination half lives determine the efficacies of PPIs. According to the literature, these drug characteristics are similar for all PPIs. Although PPIs have been introduced into the therapy of acute peptic ulcer disease at different daily, oral doses of 20 mg (omeprazole and rabeprazole), 30 mg (lansoprazole) and 40 mg (pantoprazole), the data suggest that the optimal dose of lansoprazole, omeprazole and pantoprazole, with respect to the acute treatment of peptic ulcers and moderate to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is about 30-40 mg daily. The data base of rabeprazole appears to be too small at present to make any definite statement. Lower daily doses of the PPIs of about 15-20 mg are sufficient in less severe cases of GERD and in maintenance therapy. It appears that different dose recommendations were based on different strategies to balance optimal drug dosage and safety, rather than on real differences in milligram-related efficacies.",E,E

Comparison of pharmacokinetic results from healthy volunteers with those from subjects with renal failure indicated no clinically significant differences between groups. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences between any pharmacokinetic parameters recorded during or after hemodialysis. Rabeprazole was well tolerated by both groups. Only two drug-related adverse events were reported, and there were no significant treatment-emergent changes in vital signs or ECG. Treatment-emergent changes in hematologic and clinical chemistry parameters were observed for a few subjects in each group and generally represented only slight deviations from the normal range. These results indicate that no dosage adjustment of rabeprazole is required in patients with renal dysfunction. These findings and the well-documented clinical efficacy of this new PPI in patients with gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, or gastroesophageal reflux disease support rabeprazole's use in the treatment of patients with acid peptic disorders.",I,E

As increased cisapride concentrations may result in longer electrocardiogram (ECG) QTc intervals, a crossover study was conducted in healthy subjects to evaluate the oral pharmacokinetic interaction between cisapride (20 mg) and pantoprazole (40 mg). After dosing, serial blood samples and 12-lead ECGs were collected, and cisapride plasma concentrations were quantitated. For cisapride alone, mean parameter values were the following: peak concentration (Cmax), 56 ng/mL; time to Cmax (tmax), 1.7 hours; area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), 426 ng x h/mL; and terminal half-life (t1/2), 5.8 hours. Pantoprazole coadministration did not alter cisapride AUC or other pharmacokinetic parameters except for a slight 17% decrease in Cmax' resulting in 90% confidence limits of 79% to 88%, which were marginally outside strict bioequivalence limits. In addition, cisapride did not affect ECG QTc intervals, with or without pantoprazole. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is needed when pantoprazole and cisapride are coadministered.",I,E

A total of 251 patients with duodenal ulcer were treated with either lansoprazole 30 mg/d (n = 167) or omeprazole 40 mg/d (n = 84). Patients with healed ulcers were then randomly allocated to 12 months of maintenance therapy with lansoprazole 15 mg/d (n = 74), lansoprazole 30 mg/d (n = 71), or omeprazole 20 mg/d (n = 73). Healing rates at 4 weeks (intent-to-treat analysis) were 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.2% to 97.6%) with lansoprazole and 97.5% (95% CI, 93.7% to 100%) with omeprazole; there were no significant differences between groups. Endoscopic relapse rates after 6 months were 4.5% (95% CI, 0% to 10.6%) with lansoprazole 15 mg, 0% with lansoprazole 30 mg, and 6.3% (95% CI, 1.5% to 12.5%) with omeprazole 20 mg, compared with 3.3% (95% CI, 0% to 8.2%), 0%, and 3.5% (95% CI, 0% to 8.8%), respectively, at 12 months. Again, there were no significant differences between groups. The incidence of adverse events during acute treatment was 6.0% and 7.1% in the lansoprazole and omeprazole groups, respectively; during maintenance therapy, the incidences were 12.2% (lansoprazole 15 mg), 5.6% (lansoprazole 30 mg), and 11.0% (omeprazole 20 mg). Within treatment groups, pain was significantly ameliorated after the acute phase but not after maintenance therapy (P < 0.05); no differences were observed between groups. Gastrin values increased significantly after acute therapy (P < 0.05), persisted at these increased levels during maintenance therapy, and returned to normal after 6-month follow-up. Both lansoprazole and omeprazole were highly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of duodenal ulcer; relapse rates were similar for all doses studied. Thus no additional benefit is to be gained from using a proton-pump inhibitor at a dose > 15 mg lansoprazole to prevent relapse.",I,I

The condition is caused by chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Regression of metaplasia may decrease the cancer risk.; To determine whether elimination of acid gastro-oesophageal reflux induces a regression of metaplastic epithelium.; Sixty eight patients with acid reflux and proven Barrett's oesophagus were included in a prospective, randomised, double blind study with parallel groups, and were treated with profound acid secretion suppression with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily, or with mild acid secretion suppression with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, for 24 months.

Symptoms were ameliorated in both groups. There was a small, but statistically significant regression of Barrett's oesophagus in the omeprazole group, both in length and in area. No change was observed in the ranitidine group. The difference between the regression in the omeprazole and ranitidine group was statistically significant for the area of Barrett's oesophagus (p=0. 02), and showed a trend in the same direction for the length of Barrett's oesophagus (p=0.06).; Profound suppression of acid secretion, leading to elimination of acid reflux, induces partial regression of Barrett's oesophagus.",E,E

Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection often includes either a histamine type 2 (H2)-receptor antagonist or a proton pump (H+,K(+)-ATPase) inhibitor (proton pump inhibitor), administered in conjunction with one or more antimicrobials. Also, treatment for acid-related diseases often requires extended therapy during which many concomitant medications may be administered for concurrent disease states. Polypharmacy may be the result, particularly in elderly patients, who are at increased risk for both acid-related and many other diseases. Thus, it is important to understand the potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions in this setting. H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors can influence the pharmacokinetic profiles of other commonly administered medications by elevating intragastric pH, which can alter drug absorption, and by interacting with the cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzyme system, which can affect drug metabolism and clearance. Such interactions are particularly important when they affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs with narrow therapeutic ranges (e.g. warfarin, digoxin). In these cases, drug-drug interactions can result in significant toxicity and even death. There are marked differences among H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors in their potential for such interactions. The oldest drugs in each class, cimetidine and omeprazole, respectively, have the greatest potential to alter CYP activity and change the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. The most recently developed H2-receptor antagonist, famotidine, and the newer proton pump inhibitors, rabeprazole and pantoprazole, are much less likely to induce or inhibit CYP and thereby change the metabolism of other medications. These differences are important when choosing medications for the safe treatment of patients with acid-related diseases.",I,E

Our objective was to examine the clinical, economic, and policy implications of alternative diagnostic strategies for patients with noncardiac chest pain.; Decision analysis was used to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes of two diagnostic strategies that begin with the omeprazole test (60 mg daily for 7 days) followed sequentially by invasive testing utilizing endoscopy, ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, and esophageal manometry as necessary, compared with two traditional strategies involving sequential invasive diagnostic tests. Cost estimates were based on Medicare reimbursement and the Red Book of average wholesale drug prices. Probability estimates were derived from a systematic review of the medical literature.; The average cost per patient for the four diagnostic strategies varied from $1,859 to $2,313. Strategies utilizing the initial omeprazole test resulted in 84% of patients being symptom free at 1 year, compared with 73% to 74% for the strategies that began with invasive tests. The strategy of the omeprazole test, followed if necessary by ambulatory pH monitoring, then manometry, and then endoscopy, was both most effective and least expensive. It led to an 11% improvement in diagnostic accuracy and a 43% reduction in the use of invasive diagnostic tests, thus yielding an average cost savings of $454 per patient, compared with the strategy of beginning with endoscopy, then pH monitoring, and then manometry.; Among patients with noncardiac chest pain, diagnostic strategies that begin with the omeprazole test result in reduced costs, improved diagnostic certainty, and a greater proportion of symptom-free patients at 1 year than do traditional strategies that begin with invasive diagnostic tests.",E,E

We report on our experience of treating histologically proven mucosal cancer in Barrett's esophagus with argon plasma coagulation (APC), in three patients. All the mucosal esophageal cancers, with a mean diameter of 4 mm, were successfully destroyed after one or two treatment sessions. Additionally, in two of the three patients the specialized columnar epithelium was replaced by normal squamous cell epithelium when APC treatment was combined with omeprazole. In the third patient with Barrett's esophagus, a partial squamous cell re-epithelialization was induced. No method-related mortality and morbidity were observed. During the mean follow-up of 24.3 +/- 1.1 months (range 23-25 months) one tumor recurrence developed which was successfully treated with photodynamic therapy. In patients with small early Barrett's carcinoma APC might offer an effective, minimally invasive alternative to mucosectomy or photodynamic therapy, as the treatment procedure is less cumbersome and the equipment less expensive.",E,E

This paper aims to review the technical aspects and some important applications of intragastric pH monitoring in research and clinical practice.; Literature review.; Most studies on intragastric pH are performed with either glass or antimony electrodes. Optimal measurement of 24-h intragastric pH requires accurate calibration of the pH measuring system, exact positioning of the pH electrodes, and a sufficient sample rate. Depending on the aim of the study the results of intragastric pH monitoring are expressed either as median H+ activity or as median pH values. Gastric acidity shows a circadian rhythm, modified by buffering meals and nocturnal duodenogastric reflux. In health, age, gender and smoking habits are known to influence gastric acidity. In duodenal ulcer disease an increased gastric acidity is found and in patients with gastric ulcer gastric acidity is decreased. In GERD, no relation between reflux oesophagitis and gastric acidity is found. Helicobacter pylori affects intragastric pH most pronounced during acid inhibitory therapy, both in DU patients and in healthy subjects. In the absence of H. pylori the effect of proton-pump inhibitors on intragastric pH is much less than in the presence of the microorganism, whereas the effect of ranitidine on intragastric pH is barely affected by the H. pylori status.; Despite some limitations, intragastric pH monitoring provides important information about gastric acidity.",E,E

Failures have been primarily blamed on the development of resistance to clarithromycin. The present study investigated the prevalence and clinical significance of resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole in determining therapeutic success of both triple therapy as a primary eradication method and high-dose dual therapy in non-responders.; On the basis of prior therapy, H. pylori-positive patients were assigned to one of two groups in the present prospective study. Group A (n = 93) included patients who had not undergone any prior eradication treatment, whereas group B (n = 15) consisted of patients who had received clarithromycin but in whom eradication had been unsuccessful. All patients underwent endoscopy with biopsy for bacterial culture and resistance studies. Patients in group A were treated with a 7-day regimen of pantoprazole (40 mg twice daily), metronidazole (500 mg twice daily), and clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily), whereas those in group B received omeprazole (40 mg three times a day) and amoxycillin (1000 mg three times a day ) for 14 days. Success of the eradication treatment was ascertained by means of the 13C urea breath test.; In group A resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole was identified in 3 patients (4.9%) and in 14 patients (22.9%), respectively. Eradication proved successful in 78 of 84 patients (92.6%) followed up. Two of the 3 patients with primary clarithromycin resistance and 1 of the 14 patients with metronidazole resistance did not respond to treatment. In group B isolated or combined resistance to clarithromycin was found in seven patients, whereas another four showed isolated resistance to metronidazole. Eradication proved successful in 10 of 13 controlled patients (76.9%) followed up, and only 2 patients reported severe side effects.; Determination of antibiotic resistance before initiating therapy is not necessary, since primary resistance to clarithromycin is rare. The Italian triple therapy remains a highly effective primary therapeutic method. Further, routine determination of resistance in non-responders also seems to be superfluous because high-dose dual therapy is an effective and well-tolerated second-line therapy regardless of the patients' resistance status.",3,E

Among patients using NSAIDs, 0.1 to 2.0% per year suffer serious gastrointestinal complications. Patients who require analgesic therapy should be carefully assessed for the lowest possible dosage and shortest duration of NSAID use and for the potential of treatment with a non-NSAID pain reliever. These patients should also be assessed for factors that increase their risk of gastrointestinal complications, including increased age, concomitant anticoagulant or corticosteroid use, and past history of NSAID-associated gastrointestinal complications. The exact association between Helicobacter pylori infection and NSAID-related ulcer disease is unclear, and the routine testing and treatment of all NSAID using patients for H. pylori infection is not recommended at this time. NSAID-using patients who suffer from dyspepsia should have NSAIDs discontinued, the dosage changed, or be changed to a different class of NSAID. If NSAIDs cannot be discontinued, then an antisecretory agent should be initiated. Misoprostol prevents NSAID-associated gastrointestinal complications. Proton pump inhibitors are the most effective at healing NSAID-associated ulcers among patients who cannot discontinue NSAID therapy.",E,E

It causes dose-dependent inhibition of acid secretion and has a more rapid onset of action than omeprazole. Duodenal ulcers healed faster after treatment with rabeprazole 20 or 40 mg/day than placebo or ranitidine 150 mg 4 times daily and at a generally similar rate to omeprazole 20 mg/day in patients with duodenal ulcers; rabeprazole was similar or superior to these agents in relieving symptoms. Rabeprazole 20 and 40 mg/day healed gastric ulcers faster than placebo, and rabeprazole 20 mg/day healed ulcers at a similar healing rate, to omeprazole 20 mg/day in well controlled 6-week studies. Gastric ulcer symptom relief with rabeprazole was similar or superior to that provided by omeprazole or placebo. In 8-week studies in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), rabeprazole 10, 20 and 40 mg/day were more effective than placebo, rabeprazole 20 mg/day was more effective than ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, and rabeprazole 20 mg/day was similar in efficacy to omeprazole 20 mg/day. Symptom relief with rabeprazole in 8-week trials in patients with GERD was superior to that provided by placebo, and similar to ranitidine or omeprazole. Rabeprazole was similar to omeprazole and superior to placebo in both maintenance of healing and prevention of symptoms in patients with healed GERD in 1-year studies. One-week triple therapy with rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily plus 2 antibacterial agents achieved > or = 90% Helicobacter pylori eradication, but, as would be expected, a regimen of rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily plus 1 antibacterial agent was less successful. The drug was as effective as omeprazole and lansoprazole as part of triple therapy for H. pylori eradication. Rabeprazole successfully reduced acid output to target levels and prevented further pathological changes in 10 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Usual dosages of rabeprazole are 20 mg/day for 4 weeks to treat duodenal ulcers, 6 weeks for gastric ulcers and 8 weeks for GERD, although some patients with duodenal ulcer may respond to a 10 mg/day dosage. For long term maintenance of GERD healing, 10 or 20 mg daily doses are adequate. Patients with hypersecretory states may need individualised dosages starting at 60 mg/day. The drug was well tolerated in clinical trials, with headache, rash, infection, diarrhoea and flu syndrome as the most common adverse events. In conclusion, rabeprazole appears to be a well tolerated proton pump inhibitor with a rapid onset of action and a low potential for drug interactions. The drug may be used to achieve healing and the relief of symptoms of duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and GERD, maintain GERD healing, and can form part of effective regimens to eradicate H. pylori.",E,E

Subjects underwent a chest x-ray, methacholine challenge test, and empiric trial of postnasal drip therapy, and completed daily cough symptom diaries subjectively evaluating cough frequency and severity on a graded scale of 0-4 (combined maximum 8). After excluding other causes of cough, the remaining patients underwent esophageal and pH testing. Those testing positive were randomized to omeprazole 40 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 12 weeks. Follow-up was 1 yr.; A total of 71 patients were screened; 48 were excluded. Twenty-three patients were evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux disease; six (26%) were eventually determined to have an acid-related cough. Of these patients, 17 had a positive pH test, six (35%) of whom showed a striking improvement or resolution of their cough during omeprazole treatment which was sustained for up to 1 yr. Six had a negative pH test, none of whom responded to omeprazole therapy. No significant differences were seen between responders (n = 6) and nonresponders (n = 11) for demographic factors, baseline symptom frequency and duration, or physiological parameters (motility/pH).; Acid-related chronic cough was present in 26% (six of 23) of patients evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Esophageal testing does not reliably identify patients with acid induced chronic cough responsive to proton pump inhibitor therapy.

Heartburn symptoms were measured using patient diaries and/or patient self-report. HRQL was assessed using the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB) in all three clinical trials and the SF-36 Health Survey in two clinical trials. Resolution of heartburn symptoms was defined as no heartburn reported during the assessment period.; We observed statistically significant differences favouring patients with no heartburn symptoms on the PGWB total score (P=0.018 to P < 0.0001) and anxiety (P=0.002 to P < 0.0001), general health (P=0.05 to P < 0. 0001), positive well-being (P=0.028 to P < 0.0001) and vitality (P=0. 05 to P < 0.0001) sub-scale scores at 4-14 weeks.

Evidence that acid aggravates NSAID-induced injury provides a rationale for minimising such damage by acid suppression. Other strategies discussed include avoidance of NSAIDs or minimising their dosage, selecting NSAIDs known to cause less damage, and co-prescription of various agents. Cytoprotection with misoprostol, a prostaglandin analogue, has been shown to be effective in reducing NSAID-related peptic ulcers and their complications. Unfortunately, adverse effects may limit compliance in some patients. Histamine H2 antagonists have only limited efficacy in the prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers in humans, particularly in the stomach, except at higher than standard dosages. This may relate to their relatively modest effect in elevating gastric pH, especially in comparison with proton pump inhibitors. Several studies now confirm the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in the short and longer term prevention of NSAID-induced upper gastrointestinal injury. Placebo-controlled studies suggest reductions of over 70% in gastric and duodenal ulcer rates over 3 to 6 months. The recent ASTRONAUT (Acid Suppression Trial: Ranitidine versus Omeprazole for NSAID-Associated Ulcer Treatment) study documented the greater prophylactic efficacy of omeprazole over ranitidine at standard dosages for 6 months. The OMNIUM (Omeprazole versus Misoprostol for NSAID-Induced Ulcer Management) study showed omeprazole to be slightly more effective overall than misoprostol in preventing the upper gastrointestinal adverse effects of NSAIDs, with both substantially more effective than placebo, although misoprostol was somewhat less well tolerated. Although substantial reductions in NSAID ulceration are now achievable when co-therapy with a proton pump inhibitor is given, a few patients will still develop ulcers and their complications. Hence the judicious use of NSAIDs in the first instance cannot be overemphasised.",E,E

The eradication rate of the 2-week regimen was higher than that of the 1-week regimen, but the difference was not statistically significant. Further studies including long-term economic considerations are required to determine the optimal duration of treatment.",E,E

However, most studies have analysed and emphasised H. pylori eradication rates rather than management/control of symptoms and the associated cost savings. Although H. pylori eradication therapy is very successful in clearing the infection, dyspeptic symptoms may persist and management of these can be expensive.; The aim of this study was to assess the cost implications in controlling symptoms using either H2-receptor antagonist maintenance therapy or H. pylori eradication therapy in patients with duodenal ulcer disease.; This was a non-blind, prospective, randomised, parallel-group study comparing maintenance H2-receptor antagonist treatment using ranitidine with H. pylori eradication therapy, with a 1-year follow-up.; This was a study of outpatients from general practices in Dundee, Scotland, or the Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, gastroenterology clinic.; 119 patients with confirmed duodenal ulcer, free from active ulceration at study entry but positive for H. pylori infection, who were receiving maintenance H2-receptor antagonist therapy.; Patients were randomised to receive either continuing maintenance therapy with ranitidine (initially 150 mg daily; 58 patients) or H. pylori eradication therapy using an omeprazole/amoxicillin/metronidazole regimen (or omeprazole/clarithromycin if allergic to penicillin).; Overall, H. pylori eradication rates were 100% per protocol and 95.1% intention-to-treat. At completion of 1 year of follow-up, 12 of the 61 (19.7%) patients successfully eradicated of H. pylori were still dependent on acid suppression for symptom relief. H. pylori eradication treatment was the least-cost strategy in managing/controlling symptoms at 1 year (168 Pounds vs 210 Pounds per patient; 1996 values). However, over time, post-eradication treatment costs were greater than H2-receptor antagonist therapy costs. Any potential savings were directly related to the proportion of patients needing further treatment post-eradication, the cost of endoscopy and the urea breath test.; If dyspepsia persists long term, H. pylori eradication treatment may not be the least-cost option for patients with duodenal ulcer.",E,E

They result in these complications mainly by reducing cytoprotective prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGI2) in the stomach, through the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme. The increased morbidity and mortality, in addition to enormous cost, associated with NSAID-associated side effects, necessitates a need for safer GI-friendly NSAID. Various approaches have been used to counteract NSAID associated side effects with varying degrees of success and acceptance. These include the use of alternative analgesia, anti-acid secretory agents like proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate and prostaglandin analogues. In addition, new types of NSAIDs are being developed, based on new understanding of their mechanism of action and the pathogenesis of inflammation. These include a new class of NSAIDs called ""selective Cox-2 inhibitors"". These agents preserve the COX-1 that is responsible for the production of cytoprotective prostaglandins in the stomach and selectively inhibit COX-2 induced at the sites of inflammation. Selective COX-2 inhibitors exert the same analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as the existing NSAIDs but may be less toxic to the stomach. In this review the background development and well-structured clinical trials on this new generation NSAIDs are discussed.",E,E

Numerous trials of H-2 receptor antagonists have not consistently shown a significant benefit in such patients. Proton-pump inhibitors, which more profoundly suppress gastric acid, are being increasingly evaluated. We have performed a qualitative systematic review to analyze the results of these trials to determine if a reasonable consensus can be reached. We searched for all published, randomized, controlled studies that evaluated proton-pump inhibitors in patients with acute peptic ulcer hemorrhage.

All undergo extensive hepatic metabolism and conjugation. The four agents differ in their metabolism by and effects on specific hepatic enzymes and thus in their ability to interact with other medications. PPIs are important agents used for eradicating Helicobacter pylori, in treating peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and for preventing acid aspiration. Short-term side effects of the four agents are similar. The long-term safety of pantoprazole and rabeprazole appears similar to that of omeprazole and lansoprazole. Pantoprazole, which is in the final stages of approval for marketing in the United States, will be available in both an oral and injectable formulation.; Based on superior efficacy profiles, PPIs are the drugs of choice in managing patients with peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The decision to select one PPI versus another is most likely to be based on the agents' acquisition costs, formulations, FDA-labeled indications, and overall safety profiles. Intravenous or parenteral pantoprazole may become the preferred antisecretory agent for patients unable to take oral medications (e.g., critically ill patients and those with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome).",E,E

Although H. pylori eradication is now the standard treatment of uncomplicated and bleeding peptic ulcers, its role in perforation remains controversial. Recently a high prevalence of H. pylori infection has been reported in patients with perforations of duodenal ulcer. It is unclear whether eradication of the bacterium confers prolonged ulcer remission after simple repair and hence obviates the need for an immediate definitive operation.; Of 129 patients with perforated duodenal ulcers, 104 (81%) were shown to be infected by H. pylori. Ninety-nine H. pylori-positive patients were randomized to receive either a course of quadruple anti-helicobacter therapy or a 4-week course of omeprazole alone. Follow-up endoscopy was performed 8 weeks, 16 weeks (if the ulcer did not heal at 8 weeks), and 1 year after hospital discharge for surveillance of ulcer healing and determination of H. pylori status. The endpoints were initial ulcer healing and ulcer relapse rate after 1 year.; Fifty-one patients were assigned to the anti-Helicobacter therapy and 48 to omeprazole alone. Nine patients did not undergo the first follow-up endoscopy. Of the 90 patients who did undergo follow-up endoscopy, 43 of the 44 patients in the anti-Helicobacter group and 8 of the 46 in the omeprazole alone group had H. pylori eradicated; initial ulcer healing rates were similar in the two groups (82% vs. 87%). After 1 year, ulcer relapse was significantly less common in patients treated with anti-Helicobacter therapy than in those who received omeprazole alone (4.8% vs. 38.1%).; Eradication of H. pylori prevents ulcer recurrence in patients with H. pylori-associated perforated duodenal ulcers.

Confusion stems from difficulty preoperatively in determining whether cough or wheezing is actually caused by reflux when reflux is found on pH monitoring. To date, there is no proven way to pinpoint a cause-and-effect relationship. The goals of this study were to assess the following: (1) the value of pH monitoring in establishing a correlation between respiratory symptoms and reflux; (2) the predictive value of pH monitoring on the results of surgical treatment; and (3) the outcome of laparoscopic fundoplication on GERD-induced respiratory symptoms. Between October 1992 and October 1998, a total of 340 patients underwent laparoscopic fundoplication for GERD. From the clinical findings alone, respiratory symptoms were thought possibly to be caused by GERD in 39 patients (11%). These 39 patients had been symptomatic for an average of 134 months. They were all taking H2-blocking agents (21%) or proton pump inhibitors (79%). Seven patients (18%) were also being treated with bronchodilators, alone (3 patients) or in combination with prednisone (4 patients). Median length of postoperative follow-up was 28 months. In 23 patients (59%) a temporal correlation was found during 24-hour pH monitoring between respiratory symptoms and episodes of reflux. Postoperatively heartburn resolved in 91% of patients, regurgitation in 90% of patients, wheezing in 64% of patients, and cough in 74% of patients. Cough resolved in 19 (83%) of 23 patients in whom a correlation between cough and reflux was found during pH monitoring, but in only 8 (57%) of 14 of patients when this correlation was absent. Cough persisted postoperatively in the two patients who did not cough during the study. These data show that pH monitoring helped to establish a correlation between respiratory symptoms and reflux, and it helped to identify the patients most likely to benefit from antireflux surgery. Following laparoscopic surgery, respiratory symptoms resolved in 83% of patients when a temporal correlation between cough and reflux was found on pH monitoring; heartburn and regurgitation resolved in 90%.",3,E

The rationale of all the early studies was to reduce gastric acidity, but it soon became clear that any neutralization by single doses of antacids was brief and ineffective. Winkelstein s demonstration that patients with duodenal ulcer had higher acidities not only before and after meals but also through the night hours led him to introduce a new treatment, the alkalinized intragastric milk drip together with atropine. One of the earliest controlled clinical trials at Mount Sinai compared different antacid regimes and showed that pH values above 3.5 were achieved in only about half of the patients on the various drips. When the new anticholinergic drugs were developed in the 1950s, they were found to produce sustained hypoacidity and were tried as maintenance treatment, as an alternative to acid-lowering operations. The third Mount Sinai approach was to attack the machinery of the acid-producing cell itself by an inhibitor of the enzyme producing hydrogen ions. In 1939, this enzyme had been thought to be carbonic anhydrase, but when Janowitz and Hollander tested its inhibitor, acetazolamide, and showed marked but very brief acid inhibition, they concluded that its action was too brief to be therapeutically useful. The problem was to be solved decades later by H2 receptor blockers from Britain and H+K+ATPase inhibitors from Sweden.",E,E

There are no established criteria to identify patients with healed esophagitis who will subsequently remain in remission with low-dose omeprazole therapy. We investigated whether 24-h esophageal-gastric pH monitoring could provide criteria to select patients for low-dose omeprazole maintenance therapy.; Seventy consecutive symptomatic outpatients with grade 2-3 reflux esophagitis were prospectively investigated.

After 6 wk of therapy, esophageal wall was significantly thicker in the famotidine group compared with the lansoprazole group (p<0.01). Surprisingly, thickening of esophageal wall and abnormal architecture were also detected in endoscopically negative reflux disease. Lansoprazole was superior to famotidine in reducing the thickness of esophageal wall.; EUS was very useful for evaluation of submucosal injury in patients with GERD. EUS showed that a 6-wk course of lansoprazole therapy reduced thickening of esophageal wall, which was resistant to histamine H2-receptor antagonist therapy.

Continuing efforts are being made to establish a classification of the condition that would allow improved communications for both clinical and research purposes. In medical treatment, the trends are toward proton-pump inhibitor therapy at all stages of GERD, calling into question the role of endoscopy for tailoring individual therapy. Arguments against the use of H. pylori eradication therapy in GERD have gained importance. Surgeons are continuing to report excellent results with fundoplication, but careful studies are needed to prove whether antireflux surgery is really capable of saving costs, as its proponents claim. Barrett's esophagus is still a topic of lively interest. Since there is no method of primary prevention, endoscopy has a crucial role in detecting affected patients and guiding them toward one of the various surveillance strategies--which are not yet clearly established. The debate over short-segment Barrett's esophagus, and especially over ""microscopic"" Barrett's esophagus (at the squamocolumnar junction), has not yet been resolved. However, there is now less doubt that GERD is a condition associated with a substantially higher risk for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given this risk of malignant transformation, there is continuing competition between different ablation techniques; however, careful data from much larger populations will be needed before ablation reaches the stage of broad clinical application. Until specific guidelines become available, patients with Barrett's esophagus should receive endoscopic follow-up until it can be ascertained which individuals are at risk for cancer and require ablation of Barrett's mucosa.",E,E

However, interest in H. pylori can be expected to decline, since the prevalence of the infection is rapidly decreasing in the developing world - to the point that many gastroduodenal ulcers are now unrelated to H. pylori A further reason for declining interest is disappointment regarding the role of H. pylori in dyspepsia. The expected reduction in the endoscopic workload produced by screening for H. pylori or cagA positivity has so far not occurred. The exact role of the damage caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in H. pylori-infected stomachs remains controversial. Equally controversial is the magnitude of the increased reflux symptomatology and reflux disease observed after H. pylori infection has been cured in patients with ulcer disease. Eradication therapy is largely dominated by proton-pump inhibitor triple therapies, although the efficacy of these is declining. Bismuth triple therapy and quadruple therapy continue to be valid alternatives.",E,E

Therefore, the objectives of this phase I study were to assess the potential effects of the coadministration of lansoprazole on the pharmacokinetics of propranolol and to evaluate the safety of propranolol with concomitant lansoprazole dosing. In a double-blind fashion, 18 healthy male nonsmokers were initially randomized to receive either 60 mg oral lansoprazole, each morning for 7 days, or an identical placebo (period 1). On day 7, all subjects were concomitantly administered oral propranolol, 80 mg. After a minimum of 1 week following the last dose of either lansoprazole or placebo, subjects were crossed over to the opposite treatment for another 7 days (period 2). Subjects were again administered oral propranolol on day 7. During both treatment periods, blood samples for the determination of plasma propranolol and 4-hydroxy-propranolol were obtained just before the dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours postdose. Plasma propranolol and 4-hydroxy-propranolol concentrations were determined by using HPLC with fluorescence detection. The Cmax, tmax, AUC0-infinity, and t1/2 values for propranolol, as well as the AUC0-infinity for 4-hydroxy-propranolol, were calculated and compared between the lansoprazole and placebo regimens. The mean age of the 15 subjects who successfully completed the study was 31 years (range: 24-38 years), and their average weight was 174.8 pounds (range: 145-203 pounds). There were no statistically significant differences between the lansoprazole and placebo regimens for the propranolol Cmax, tmax, AUC0-infinity, and t1/2 values. Also, there were no statistically significant differences between regimens for the 4-OH-propranolol AUC0-infinity. Safety evaluations, which included adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory determinations, ECG, and physical examinations, revealed no unexpected clinically significant findings and did not suggest a drug-drug interaction. In conclusion, lansoprazole does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of propranolol, suggesting that it does not interact with the CYP2D6- or CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of propranolol. Modification of a propranolol dosage regimen in the presence of lansoprazole is not indicated, based on the pharmacokinetic analysis and the lack of a clinically significant alteration in the pharmacodynamic response.",I,E

First, a decision model was constructed to compare expected costs and outcomes of 6 management strategies. Second, principles of quantitative literature review and meta-analysis were used to determine probabilities of clinical events (i.e. oesophagitis healing and recurrence). Finally, principles of cost-effectiveness analysis were used to compare treatment alternatives in terms of dominance and incremental cost effectiveness. The viewpoint for the study was that of a provincial government payer for healthcare over a 1-year period.; Healing rates were significantly higher for proton pump inhibitors (PPI) [p < 0.001]. Recurrence rates were significantly higher for intermittent therapy (placebo) and lower for regular dose PPI (p < 0.001). Maintenance prokinetic agent (PA) is dominated (i.e. more costly and less effective) and step-down maintenance PPI is dominated through principles of extended dominance. The 'efficient frontier' is represented by: maintenance H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA), intermittent PPI, step-down maintenance H2RA and maintenance PPI.; The price of H2RA is a key factor influencing whether step-down maintenance PPI forms part of, or is contained within, the 'efficient frontier' of long term management for erosive oesophagitis.",I,E

According to recent international guidelines the clinical goals--rapid ulcer healing and prevention of relapse--can be best accomplished by combination therapy consisting of an antisecretory drug (proton pump inhibitor or ranitidine) and 2 antimicrobial agents (preferable amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole). When applying such multidrug regimens, possible synergy between the agents suggests that pharmacokinetic considerations might help to improve H. pylori eradication rates, which should be above 85 to 90% on an intention-to-treat basis. The present review summarises the pharmacokinetic properties and interaction potential of all drugs presently used in the various H. pylori eradication regimens, with emphasis on particular patient populations such as the elderly and those with renal impairment. The drugs considered are omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, ranitidine and ranitidine bismutrex, bismuth salts, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin, metronidazole, tinidazole and tetracycline. When addressing the clinically important questions of the efficacy, safety and costs of the recommended regimens, the impact of drug disposition on H. pylori eradication should not be neglected.",E,E

Three combinations commonly described in the literature were used: a) omeprazole (40 mg/24 h), tetracycline hydrochloride (2 g/24 h), colloidal bismuth subcitrate (480 mg/24 h) and metronidazole (750 mg/24 h) (OBTM, n = 105); b) omeprazole (40 mg/24 h), clarithromycin (1.5 g/24 h) and amoxicillin (3 g/24 h) (O40C1.5A3, n = 13); and c) omeprazole (40 mg/24 h), clarithromycin (1 g/24 h) and amoxicillin (2 g/24 h) (O40C1A2, n = 4). In all patients the diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease was confirmed endoscopically, and H. pylori infection was verified with urease testing and histological analysis. After treatment ended, no other antacids were allowed until after endoscopic examination to check eradication and ulcer healing.; 122 patients were included (107 with duodenal ulcer, 12 with gastric ulcer and 3 with both). Compliance was good and side effects infrequent and mild. Eradication rates were 88.5% (93/105) in the OBTM group, 100% (13/13) with O40C1.5A3, and 75% (3/4) with O40C1A2.

The mode of transmission of H. pylori remains unclear, and it remains unknown why only a small proportion of infected individuals develop duodenal or gastric ulcer disease and even fewer develop gastric cancer. The role of H. pylori eradication in persons with uninvestigated dyspepsia remains controversial. New clinical trials of H. pylori treatment show symptom relief and improvement in the quality of life of persons with functional dyspepsia, especially in those with ulcer-like or reflux-like dyspepsia. Clearly the move is toward symptom-based management of persons with dyspepsia, with fewer endoscopies being needed in the otherwise healthy young dyspeptic patients. It remains controversial whether eradicating H. pylori in duodenal ulcer or functional dyspepsia increases the risk of subsequent development of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The one-week proton pump inhibitor-based triple regimens remain the gold standard of H. pylori therapy, but some of the ranitidine bismuth citrate plus two antibiotic regimens also achieve an 80% H. pylori eradication rate on an intention-to-treat basis. While the urea breath test remains the noninvasive test of choice, interesting new data are available on the use of stool antigen testing to diagnose H. pylori infection.

Three visits were scheduled: wk 0 (baseline; days -3 to -1), wk 2 (day 15+/-3 days), and wk 4 (day 29+/-3 days). The primary efficacy response variable was defined as complete regeneration of the mucosa at the site of all ulcers identified during the study. Secondary efficacy variables included patients' ratings of frequency and severity of ulcer pain, frequency of antacid use, and improvement of overall physical well-being. Tolerability was evaluated with analyses of adverse events, laboratory evaluations, fasting serum gastrin levels, vital signs, body weight, and electrocardiograms.; Up to 4 wk of treatment with rabeprazole 20 mg q.a.m. produced significantly greater healing rates, compared to treatment with ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.

It is increasingly recognized that different causes of ulcers coexist in a given patient, confounding determination of the exact cause of the ulcer. For example, in infected patients with ulcers who also are using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), it is not possible to establish the ulcer's cause. Moreover, recent studies in the United States in infected patients with duodenal ulcers who were treated with various regimens to prove their efficacy in eradicating H. pylori and preventing ulcer recurrence found that approximately 20% of patients suffered an ulcer recurrence despite successful H. pylori eradication. The infection clearly did not cause their ulcers but was originally thought to have done so. Thus, as many as one-fifth of patients with ulcers may have the cause falsely attributed to H. pylori infection. When this number is added to that of ulcer patients who are H. pylori-negative upon original presentation--at least 20% in other recent U.S. studies--it is evident that the proportion of non-H. pylori ulcer patients is larger than originally believed. This proportion is likely to increase with the declining incidence of H. pylori infection. Other causes of ulcers include the use of aspirin and NSAIDs (which may be surreptitious), hypersecretory states, Crohn's disease, and patients with ""idiopathic"" ulcers. Patients with ""idiopathic"" ulcers are characterized by postprandial hypersecretion of acid and hypergastrinemia with accelerated gastric emptying. H. pylori ulcers may be difficult to manage because antisecretory drugs are less effective in inhibiting gastric acidity in the absence of H. pylori infection.",E,E

Omeprazole prevents the formation, and accelerates the healing, of NSAID-induced ulcers.; To test whether omeprazole accelerates healing of standardized gastroduodenal lesions in the presence of diclofenac.; In a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received consecutive, 2-week courses of omeprazole (40 mg o.d.) and placebo, in random order, with an intervening, 4-week washout period; diclofenac (50 mg t.d.s.), was given for the second week of each course. Five endoscopies were performed, one at the outset and the others before and after each course of diclofenac. Biopsies were taken from the endoscopically normal mucosa of the corpus, antrum and duodenum and also from any new mucosal lesion that developed after diclofenac. The sites of biopsies taken before each course of diclofenac were evaluated endoscopically after each course to assess the extent of healing according to a predetermined healing score scale.; The healing scores observed after administration of placebo/diclofenac (median=0; range 0-6) and after omeprazole/diclofenac (median=0; range 0-6; P=0.17) did not differ. Small gastroduodenal lesions developed de novo in six subjects during placebo/diclofenac and in seven during omeprazole/diclofenac. Focal chemical gastropathy was observed only in close proximity to macroscopic lesions.; In healthy subjects, omeprazole does not accelerate the healing of pre-existing mucosal lesions or prevent the development of small diclofenac-induced mucosal lesions.",E,E

However, the role of other proton pump inhibitors, such as pantoprazole (Pan), in this therapy is not well known. On the other hand, ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) also seems to be effective when combined with Amo and CIa. Our aim was to evaluate and to compare these two novel short-term triple therapies (Pan+Amo+Cla and RBC+Amo+Cla) for treatment of Helicobacter pylori.; In a randomized clinical trial 150 consecutive patients (38 with duodenal ulcer, 112 with non-ulcer dyspepsia) infected by H. pylori were studied prospectively. Exclusion criteria were: previous H. pylori eradication therapy, gastroerosive drug use, gastric surgery, and associated diseases. One of two regimens was given for 7 days: Pan (40 mg b.i.d.), Amo (1 g b.i.d.), Cla (500 mg b.i.d.) (group Pan+Amo+Cla, n = 75); or RBC (400 mg b.i.d.), Amo (1 g b.i.d.), Cla (500 mg b.i.d.) (group RBC+Amo+Cla, n = 75). All drugs were administered together after meals. Compliance was evaluated by return tablet count. Data were analysed by univariate (chi2) and multivariate (multiple logistic regression) analysis. Eradication was defined as a negative 13C-urea breath test 1 month after completing therapy.; The distribution of studied variables (age, gender, smoking, duodenal ulcer/non-ulcer dyspepsia) was similar in both therapy groups.

Potential areas of concern regarding long-term proton pump inhibitor use have included: carcinoid formation; development of gastric adenocarcinoma (especially in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection); bacterial overgrowth; enteric infections; and malabsorption of fat, minerals, and vitamins. Prolonged proton pump inhibitor use may lead to enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia, but has not been demonstrated to increase the risk of carcinoid formation. Long-term proton pump inhibitor treatment has not been documented to hasten the development or the progression of atrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer, although long-term studies are required to allow definitive conclusions. At present, we do not recommend that patients be tested routinely for H. pylori infection when using proton pump inhibitors for prolonged periods. Gastric bacterial overgrowth does increase with acid suppression, but important clinical sequelae, such a higher rate of gastric adenocarcinoma, have not been seen. The risk of enteric infection may increase with acid suppression, although this does not seem to be a common clinical problem with prolonged proton pump inhibitor use. The absorption of fats and minerals does not appear to be significantly impaired with chronic acid suppression. However, vitamin B12 concentration may be decreased when gastric acid is markedly suppressed for prolonged periods (e.g. Zolllinger-Ellison syndrome), and vitamin B12 levels should probably be assessed in patients taking high-dose proton pump inhibitors for many years. Thus, current evidence suggests that prolonged gastric acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors rarely, if ever, produces adverse events. Nevertheless, continued follow-up of patients taking proton pump inhibitors for extended periods will provide greater experience regarding the potential gastrointestinal adverse effects of long-term acid suppression.",I,E

The function of u-PA and u-PAR was ablated with antisense oligonucleotides to block expression, with synthetic u-PA peptides to block interaction, and with aprotinin to block u-PA mediated proteolysis.; Migration was stimulated two to threefold by exogenous u-PA, an effect dependent on u-PAR binding but independent of u-PA mediated mitogenesis and proteolysis. Expression of u-PA and u-PAR was inhibited by 80% by the appropriate antisense oligonucleotide. Basal migration and the motogenic effects of butyrate, epidermal growth factor, and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate were suppressed by the u-PAR antisense oligonucleotide (40-60%) but were at best minimally affected following inhibition of u-PA expression and binding.; In an in vitro model of wounded colonic epithelium, u-PAR promotes cell migration through mechanisms that are not exclusively dependent on u-PA binding. Therefore, u-PA and u-PAR may contribute to colonic mucosal repair in vivo.",I,E

In 117 patients the surgical treatment was simple closure and postsurgery medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors for 1 month, and in 90 patients vagotomy and pyloroplasty with no additional medical treatment.; We applied the Visick scale in order to compare postsurgery results. The postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were the same with both techniques. Statistically, in both cases, no significant differences were found in postsurgery symptomatology. The different rates of recurrent ulcers and the reinterventions due to recurrent ulcers presented no significant statistical values.; We conclude that simple closure remains the selected treatment in the majority of patients who present with a perforated duodenal ulcer.

The frequency of this event and the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. As such, it is unknown whether there is a relation with either serum gastrin or Helicobacter pylori infection, and whether PCP predisposes to the development of fundic gland cysts (FGC). We therefore investigated the development of PCP and FGC in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients treated with omeprazole and correlated findings to duration of therapy, gastrin, and H pylori infection. In a randomized, double-blinded study, GERD patients were evaluated by endoscopy with biopsy sampling for histology and culture at baseline, and after 3 and 12 months' therapy with omeprazole 40 mg daily. H pylori-positive patients were randomized to additional eradication therapy or placebo antibiotics at baseline. All histological slides were scored blinded for time and outcome of culture for the presence of PCP and FGC. Fasting serum samples from all visits were used for gastrin measurements. The prevalence of PCP increased during omeprazole therapy from 18% at baseline to 79% and 86% at 3 and 12 months (P < .001, baseline v both 3 and 12 months). The prevalence of FGC increased from 8% to 17% and 35% (P < .05, baseline v 12 months). The prevalence of PCP and FGC did not differ among the H pylori-positive and H pylori-negative patients at baseline (PCP 16% v 20% and FGC 7% v 8%, respectively). Whereas H pylori eradication did not significantly affect development of PCP (P = .7), FGC developed significantly more often in the H pylori-eradicated patients when compared with persistent H pylori-positive patients (P < .05). PCP development was related to serum gastrin rise during therapy. In conclusion, PCP occurs in most patients within the first months of omeprazole treatment and is related to increased gastrin levels. FGC develops more gradually and is enhanced by H pylori eradication.",E,E

The test and treatment costs per patient were calculated.; Of 67 patients with a negative rapid urease test, 4 were positive for H pylori. None had active peptic ulcer disease. Histology only identified 1 patient with organisms visible on special stain. Using chronic active gastritis (neutrophilic and mononuclear infiltrate) as a diagnostic criterion for H pylori, 6 patients would have been judged positive. However, only 2 of these were truly positive by the reference standard (positive predictive value 33%). Negative predictive value for presence of organisms and chronic active gastritis was 95% and 97%, respectively. All of the noninvasive tests identified all 4 truly positive patients correctly.

The proton-pump inhibitor rabeprazole has been extensively evaluated in well-controlled trials in North America and Europe for the acute treatment of erosive or ulcerative GORD and gastric and duodenal ulcers and for the long-term maintenance of GORD healing. The results show that rabeprazole has a favourable benefit/risk profile for each indication. Rabeprazole 10 and 20 mg given once daily in the morning was highly effective in producing and maintaining healing, providing symptom relief, and improving overall well-being. Healing rates for rabeprazole were equivalent to omeprazole in all indications, and superior (GORD healing and duodenal ulcer healing) or equivalent (gastric ulcer healing) to the histamine 2-receptor antagonist ranitidine. Symptom relief provided by rabeprazole was equivalent or superior to comparator drugs. Rabeprazole was well tolerated in both short- and long-term studies.

Recently, triple therapies based on ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) have emerged as an alternative. This review examines the current literature for studies directly comparing proton pump inhibitor- with RBC-based triple therapies. Seventeen studies were identified, of which three have been published as a full paper. Eradication rates in an intention-to-treat analysis ranged from 51 to 98%. No large difference in cure rates between the different regimens was demonstrated, although the RBC-I-C combination was somewhat superior. No definite conclusions could be made about the impact of metronidazole or clarithromycin resistance since only three studies performed a formal resistance analysis. No serious side-effects were reported, and dropout rates were equal for the two regimens. Both RBC- and proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies are highly effective. If one prefers a imidazole/clarithromycin combination the evidence presented here suggests that RBC should be used instead of a proton pump inhibitor. Larger studies comparing both forms of triple therapy, using proper resistance analysis, are needed before final conclusions can be reached regarding efficacy in the setting of bacterial resistance.",I,I

The therapeutic objectives are alleviating symptoms, preventing complications and, if possible, avoiding recurrence, and should ideally be judged in terms of health gain, including quality of life improvement. Obtaining value for money, by maximizing the health gain in relation to the cost of the overall medical intervention must also be acknowledged as a desirable aim of management, with the proviso that physicians must always treat each patient as an individual and individualize clinical management appropriately.",E,E

The primary indicator of efficacy was the absence of esophageal erosions or ulcerations as determined by posttreatment endoscopy. Secondary indicators of efficacy included improvement in frequency and severity of daytime and nighttime heartburn.; A total of 338 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to therapy with rabeprazole 20 mg once daily in the morning or to ranitidine 150 mg four times daily. At baseline and at 4 wk, patients underwent endoscopy for evaluation of esophageal lesions. Patients whose lesions healed by wk 4 had therapy discontinued; others remained on therapy and had repeat endoscopy at 8 wk. Also recorded at study visits were patients' ratings of heartburn symptoms and overall sense of well being, patients' reports of time lost from daily activities, antacid use, and adverse events. Serum gastrin levels were measured and argyrophil enterochromaffin-like cell histology evaluated at baseline and when the patient ended therapy.; At wk 4, healing was observed in 59% (98/167) of patients assigned to rabeprazole therapy, compared with 36% (60/169) of those receiving ranitidine (p < 0.001). By 8 wk, healing was seen in 87% (146/167) and 66% (112/169) of patients in the rabeprazole and ranitidine groups, respectively (p < 0.001). There were also significant differences between the two groups favoring rabeprazole with respect to resolution or improvement of heartburn symptoms and improvement in sense of well-being. No drug-related serious adverse events were seen with either therapy; fewer patients assigned to rabeprazole had treatment-emergent signs and symptoms. Serum gastrin levels increased over baseline in the rabeprazole group, but the mean value remained within normal limits.; Rabeprazole was superior to ranitidine in esophageal healing and symptom relief in patients with erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease, and was equally well tolerated.",I,I

Although these drugs-omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole-share a common structure (all are substituted benzimidazoles) and mode of action (inhibition of H+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase [ATPase]), each differs somewhat in its clinical pharmacology.; In comparative clinical trials found in MEDLINE, PPIs administered once daily produced endoscopic evidence of healing in >90% of patients with duodenal ulcer after 4 weeks of treatment, in >90% of those with gastric ulcer after 6 weeks of treatment, and in >90% of those with ulcerative or erosive GERD after 8 weeks of treatment. Maintenance therapy with daily doses of a PPI has been shown to be an effective means of preventing GERD relapse. PPIs also inhibit the growth of Helicobacter pylori, now recognized as an important factor in peptic ulcer disease, and, when administered in combination with antibiotics, provide the best treatment for eradication of the bacterium. Rabeprazole has a more rapid onset of H+,K+-ATPase inhibition than the other PPIs and, compared with omeprazole, a greater effect on intragastric pH after the first dose. Omeprazole and lansoprazole have a greater potential for drug-drug interactions than do pantoprazole and rabeprazole.; Although the individual PPIs have similar efficacy in many cases, differences between them should be considered when choosing a treatment regimen.",E,E

In general, the choice of instrument depends on its purpose. Several investigators, using generic quality of life instruments, have shown that GORD significantly reduces QoL, and its effects are comparable with those of congestive heart failure. However, these generic instruments do not seem to be sensitive enough to measure the effects of treatments on GORD. For this, disease-specific instruments are more appropriate.

H. pylori is not uncommon in the Malaysian population. Marked racial differences and the consistently low prevalence rates amongst Malays are noted. The working party recommends that if endoscopy is to be performed, a rapid urease test should be used for diagnosis. Where suspicion of the infection is strong and the urease test is negative, histology should be performed on gastric biopsies. Culture should be used to monitor resistance patterns to antibiotics and regional laboratories should assume this responsibility. The urea breath tests are highly accurate tests for diagnosis of H. pylori but is as yet not widely available in Malaysia. The working party strongly recommends that all peptic ulcer patients infected with H. pylori whether active, in remission and complicated ulcers should be treated for the infection. Patients with low-grade gastric mucosal lymphoid tissue lymphoma should also be treated for H. pylori infection. It is considered advisable that patients on long term nonsteroidal antinflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment with a history of peptic ulcers or dyspepsia and patients following resection of early gastric cancer or those with a family history of gastric cancer should also be tested and treated for H. pylori. The working party recommends, as first line treatment a 7-day combination therapy of a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and metronidazole or amoxicillin. High metronidazole resistance rates locally may adversely affect regimens containing the antibiotic.

There have been a number of national and international consensus meetings to propose guidelines to treat H. pylori infection. The recommendations of these conferences are reviewed here and updated to include new indications and concepts regarding H. pylori eradication therapy. Eradication therapy is considered the standard of care for active or inactive peptic ulcer patients including those who use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Other strong indications include MALT lymphoma, hyperplastic polyps, hyperplastic gastropathy, post-endoscopic resection for gastric malignancy, and acute H. pylori gastritis. Other considerations include plan to use chronic NSAID therapy, plan for chronic anti-secretory therapy, and some extra-gastroduodenal diseases such as chronic ureterica. Non-investigated dyspepsia is an indication for diagnostic evaluation and eradication therapy for those with H. pylori infection, whereas non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) in which peptic ulcer disease has been excluded is not an indication for evaluation per se. Intervention studies are now in progress to test the hypothesis that prevention of gastric malignancy is an outcome of H. pylori eradication. Because the prevalence of H. pylori infection and the associated diseases such as peptic ulcer or gastric cancer differ among countries as well as different approvals for treatment are required by governments or insurance agencies, the acceptable indications of eradication therapy will, by necessity, vary among countries.",E,E

The current approach is to make a firm diagnosis, give combination antibiotic and antisecretory therapy, and confirm that the infection has been cured 4 to 6 weeks later. Antimicrobial resistance is largely responsible for treatment failures. Resistance to metronidazole can frequently be overcome by increasing the dose and duration of treatment with acid suppression. Clarithromycin is the most effective antibiotic against H. pylori but, unfortunately, resistance to it is increasing and can not be overcome by increasing the dose or duration of therapy with clarithromycin. The choice of therapy should be based on local susceptibility patterns. Re-treatment regimens for treatment failure should exclude antibiotics where acquired resistance is expected (i.e., clarithromycin and possibly metronidazole). Where available, treatment failure should prompt endoscopy and culture and susceptibility testing. Overall, higher doses and longer durations of treatment result in the best cure rates. When multiple treatment regimens fail, salvage therapy regimens such as bismuth or furazolidone quadruple therapy (a bismuth and tetracycline HCl 4 times a day along with a proton pump inhibitor twice a day, and either metronidazole 400 or 500 mg three times daily or furazolidone 100 mg three times daily for 14 days) can be used.

10989974,New treatment for Barrett's oesophagus.,Barrett Esophagus; Humans,"Barbezat, G O","Barrett's esophagus is characterised by the presence of specialised intestinal metaplasia in the lower esophagus. Its importance is related primarily to its link with adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, often preceded by dysplastic changes. The incidence of this carcinoma has increased dramatically over the last few decades. Although modern treatments, particularly acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors, have been most useful in controlling the reflux symptoms associated with Barrett's esophagus, they have not reduced the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The same can be said about anti-reflux surgery. Surgical excision of Barrett's esophagus has been advocated when high-grade dysplasia is detected; this carries considerable morbidity and mortality, so alternative treatments are being developed. This update summarises recent information concerning newer treatments aimed at eradicating Barrett's esophagus. These vary from thermal coagulation (using electrocoagulation and heater probes) to lasers, photodynamic therapy and mechanical methods. Of these, photodynamic therapy using a porphyrin precursor (5-amino-laevulinic acid) seems to give the most consistent satisfactory results with a minimum of complications. However, persistence of some metaplastic cells beneath the neo-squamous layer remains a problem. Ongoing effective acid control (by medical or surgical therapy) is also essential to prevent recurrence of Barrett's esophagus. Future research is aimed at perfecting these methods. Ultimately, it may be possible to understand the molecular biology which could help to predict which patients are at greatest risk of developing dysplastic and carcinomatous changes.",E,E

Outcome measures investigated were endoscopic ulcers, ulcer complications, symptoms, overall dropouts, dropouts due to symptoms, and study quality.; Thirty-four RCT met the inclusion criteria. All doses of misoprostol significantly reduced the risk of endoscopic ulcers.

Some of these tests (e.g. the acid perfusion test) have become obsolete after the advent of 24-hour oesophageal pH monitoring. With the latter test not only can excessive reflux be identified, but also, and more importantly, a temporal relationship can be demonstrated between a patient's symptoms and reflux episodes. Radiographical examination of the oesophagus has largely been replaced by endoscopy, although the use of the former test is still indicated in certain circumstances (e.g. in the differentiation of sliding from para-oesophageal hiatus hernia). In clinical practice, the so-called proton pump inhibitor test has gained considerable popularity. Despite several studies on the specificity and sensitivity of this test, its value has not yet been established with sufficient accuracy. Conventional manometric evaluation of lower oesophageal sphincter pressure has been over-emphasized as a diagnostic test in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.",E,E

A total of 174/179 patients with a relapse were assessed in the second phase, and 74 and 28% in the omeprazole and placebo group, respectively, were defined as responders (P: < 0.001, 95% confidence interval 33-59).; GERD patients are highly responsive to omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. They are equally responsive to omeprazole 20 mg o.m. at symptomatic relapse, but have a low response rate to placebo. Omeprazole is a valuable therapeutic instrument to detect and treat patients with GERD in general practice.",I,E

Studies also indicate that the infection is frequently lost in childhood; however, it is still unclear whether this is related to the use of antibacterials, the natural history of the infection, or both. H. pylori colonises gastric mucosa and is causally related to chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in both children and adults. Successful eradication of H. pylori has resulted in the healing of duodenal ulcers and the lowering of the ulcer relapse rate in children. Therapy to cure the infection should be started in all children with peptic (duodenal or gastric) ulcer who are still infected. The ideal anti-H. pylori regimen should be safe, cheap, easy to comply with, well tolerated by children and able to achieve a high cure rate. Although US data are lacking, it is anticipated that the treatment regimen for children should be similar to that in adults (a triple therapy regimen that combines a proton pump inhibitor with 2 antimicrobial agents for 14 days). It is inappropriate to prescribe anti-H. pylori therapy without a firm diagnosis. The use of multiple antibacterials in a paediatric patient with an ulcer but without H. pylori infection cannot provide any benefit to the patient or the community. Such an approach only provides the possibility for adverse effects, for example development of antibacterial resistance among bystander bacteria. It is very important to confirm the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. The [13C]urea breath test is the noninvasive method of choice to determine H. pylori status in children and the ideal test for post-therapy testing. There is a need for post-therapy confirmation because of the likelihood of poor outcome for some treatment regimens, which is why post-therapy testing should be the standard of care. There is weak and inconsistent evidence of an association between H. pylori infection and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children, in part because of the unclear definition of RAP in the literature. Therefore, there is still considerable debate regarding the treatment of infected children with RAP.",E,E

Treatment of established gastroduodenal ulcers is accomplished best by withholding the offending drugs. Proton-pump inhibitors appear to heal ulcers at the same rate whether or not NSAID therapy is continued. After the ulcer is healed and if NSAID therapy must be continued, prophylaxis is accomplished best by the concomitant use of proton-pump inhibitors, misoprostol (at least 200 micrograms 3 times a day), or a NSAID that preferentially inhibits COX-2. The future development of newer, safer NSAID preparations, including highly selective COX-2 inhibitors and nitric oxide-releasing NSAIDs, should provide better treatment options for the increasing number of individuals requiring anti-inflammatory agents.",E,E

In the general population the prevalence of infection and of polypharmacy increases the possibility of drug-drug interactions during H. pylori eradication therapy. The purpose of the present study was to assess the prevalence, degree, and clinical relevance of metabolic interference with the cytochrome P450 enzymatic system occurring during 1 wk of administration of omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole followed by the association of clarithromycin and metronidazole for another week. The 13C aminopyrine breath test (ABT) was chosen to screen for possible interactions.; We studied 30 patients referred to our Unit for H. pylori eradication therapy. They were randomized to receive either omeprazole (20 mg b.i.d.), lansoprazole (30 mg b.i.d.), or pantoprazole (40 mg b.i.d.) for 2 wk. During the second week clarithromycin (250 mg b.i.d.) and metronidazole (500 mg b.i.d.) were added. ABT was performed before, and at the end of the first and second week of therapy. Percentage of the administered dose of 13C recovered per hour at the peak (percent 13C dose/h at the peak) and cumulative percentage of administered dose of 13C recovered over time at 120 min (percent 13C dose cum120) were the ABT evaluated parameters.; At baseline all patients showed a normal liver function. In individual patients during treatment we observed various liver metabolic interactions both as inhibition and induction, as well as after the first and the second week of therapy. However, mean modifications of the ABT parameters during the 2 weeks of therapy were not statistically significant compared to baseline values. None of the patients who had ABT variations complained of side effects.; H. pylori eradication therapy interferes with cytochrome P450-dependent liver metabolic activity. However, the clinical relevance of these metabolic interactions is not yet apparent, and further investigation is needed. H. pylori eradication therapy appears safe, but these interactions should be considered in the choice of proton pump inhibitor and antimicrobial agents.",I,E

As a therapeutic group, the PPIs are highly useful for the relief of symptoms and healing of gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastric and duodenal ulcer disease, eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection, prevention and treatment of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated damage, management of hypersecretory states such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and care of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or non-ulcer dyspepsia. The pathophysiologic basis of these management benefits lies in the potent gastric acid inhibitory effects of the PPIs. There are differences between the PPIs in their pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, influence by food and antacids, clinical efficacy, and potential for drug interactions. It is not always clear whether these often subtle variations are necessarily of clinical importance.

We aimed to compare the symptomatic effects of eradication therapy with those of long-term omeprazole treatment in a design with periods both with and without acid inhibition.; Patients with active duodenal ulcer were randomized either to omeprazole, 20 mg twice daily until healing, followed by omeprazole, 20 mg/ day for 1 year, or to eradication therapy (metronidazole, amoxicillin, and omeprazole for 2 weeks) followed by placebo for 1 year. All patients were followed up passively for an additional year. Clinical controls were performed every 2 months the 1st year (maintenance phase) and every 6 months during the passive follow-up phase. The study was multicentric and double-blind. The primary end-point was discontinuation of treatment, irrespective of reason.; Two hundred and seventy-six patients were randomized (139 in the eradication treatment group). In the maintenance phase there were no differences in the reporting of dyspeptic symptoms or in premature withdrawal. In the passive follow-up phase only five patients in the eradication therapy group discontinued owing to relapse of dyspeptic symptoms or ulcer, compared with 51 patients initially randomized to long-term omeprazole. There were no differences in reflux symptoms or in the development of reflux oesophagitis.; Eradication therapy and long-term omeprazole are equally effective in controlling dyspeptic symptoms and reflux in duodenal ulcer patients with healed ulcers. One-quarter of the duodenal ulcer patients who start eradication therapy continue to be symptomatic or fail therapy for other reasons over a 2-year period. Eradication therapy does not increase the risk of reflux in ulcer patients.",I,E

Twenty-nine patients found to have GOR were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive omeprazole 40 mg o.d. or placebo for 8 weeks. After a 2-week washout period, patients were crossed over to the other treatment. Symptoms were recorded daily in a diary. Twenty-one patients completed both treatment periods. Cough (p=0.02) and gastric symptoms (p=0.003) improved significantly during the omeprazole treatment in twelve patients who received placebo during the first and omeprazole during the second 8-week period. In nine patients who received omeprazole during the first 8-week period, amelioration in cough reached statistical significance only after cessation of omeprazole. Gastric symptoms also remained minor during placebo in these nine patients.

The bioavailability of pantoprazole is not altered by concomitant administration of food or antacids or with repeated dosing. Both oral and IV formulations of pantoprazole exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. Several clinical trials have proved pantoprazole superior to histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in reducing acid secretion and elevating gastric pH levels. Pantoprazole has been shown to be more effective than ranitidine (P < 0.05), famotidine (P < 0.001), and nizatidine (P < 0.05), and at least as effective as omeprazole, in healing erosive esophagitis and relieving associated symptoms of GERD, including regurgitation. Pantoprazole is also more effective than the H2RA nizatidine for the treatment of nighttime heartburn (P < 0.05). Studies have shown pantoprazole to be well tolerated; adverse events, including headache, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, eructation, nausea, and rash, occurred in < or = 6% of patients. The oral and IV formulations of pantoprazole are equally potent in inhibiting gastric acid secretion; thus, switching between formulations requires no dosage adjustments. Special patient populations, including the elderly and patients with renal or mild to moderate hepatic impairment, can take pantoprazole without an adjustment in dosage.; Because of its unique pharmacokinetic properties, mechanism of action, and reduced potential for producing cytochrome P-450-based drug interactions, pantoprazole in both oral and IV formulations is effective over a full 24 hours and is well tolerated in a variety of patient types.",E,E

Although several oral drug combination regimens are associated with eradication rates of approximately 85% in controlled trials, the success rate in patients infected with a resistant strain of H pylori is closer to 75%. Resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin, which are common components of combination treatment regimens, is of greatest concern. Reported rates of H pylori resistance to various antibiotics vary considerably. In Canada, the data documenting H pylori susceptibility are limited but suggest that resistance to these antibiotics varies geographically and within specific treatment groups. Although susceptibility testing is not a prerequisite for initial treatment of individual patients infected with H pylori, formal efforts to identify and monitor both the causes and prevalence of antibiotic resistance across Canada are a much needed step in the ongoing management of this important infection. Recommended treatment regimens may be useful, even for treating apparently resistant H pylori strains. However, it is important to understand the mechanisms of the development of resistant strains to manage patients with treatment failure better.",3,E

Our study sought to determine the current epidemiology of acute UGIB (incidence, mortality and case fatality) in the prefecture of Heraklion-Crete.; From February 1998 to February 1999, we prospectively obtained data on all patients with acute UGIB in the prefecture of Heraklion-Crete. All patients who were permanent residents of the prefecture of Heraklion, aged 16 years and over with acute UGIB were included in the study.; During this period, 353 cases of acute UGIB were included in the study. The overall incidence of acute UGIB is 160/100,000 adults per year with a male-to-female ratio of 1.7 and a mean age 66.2 +/- 17.1 years. The incidence rises from 30 in those aged under 30 years to 609 in those aged over 75 years. The overall population mortality was 9/100,000 adults per year. Overall case fatality during hospitalization was 5.6%. All deaths occurred in patients older than 60 years. One or more comorbid illnesses were noted in 61% of cases. Recent intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was reported in 49% of the cases. The most common recorded diagnoses were erosive disease in 108 (30.5%) patients, duodenal ulcer in 97 (27.4%) and gastric ulcer in 75 (21.2%). Rebleeding occurred in 41 patients (12%).

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent stimulant of repair in in vitro and in vivo models. We therefore examined its potential beneficial effect in reducing mortality and injury induced by the noxious agent thioacetamide (TAA).; Mice (20 per group) were fasted overnight and received a single intraperitoneal dose of human recombinant EGF at 10 or 30 microg/kg or saline (control). Either 30 minutes before or after EGF, all animals also received TAA (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Twenty four hours later, surviving animals were killed, tissues collected, and degree of organ injury assessed.; Fifty per cent (10/20) of control animals died within the first 24 hour period. Mortality was almost completely prevented by the higher dose of EGF whether given before or after TAA (p<0.01) and was reduced by about 50% with the lower dose of EGF. In control animals, the entire length of the jejunum and ileum had necrosis with or without mucosal denudation. In contrast, necrosis affected only about 10-20% of the total length in EGF treated groups (both p<0.01 v control). Control animals showed marked glomerular tuft collapse, interstitial haemorrhage, and increased plasma creatinine levels. These effects were significantly reduced in animals given EGF (30 microg/kg; p<0.01). All groups showed similar changes in liver histology (centrilobular necrosis) and alanine transaminase levels (10-fold increase).; Although EGF did not prevent the hepatotoxicity associated with TAA, it reduced mortality, renal injury, and gastrointestinal damage. These studies provide preliminary evidence that EGF may be a novel approach for the prevention and/or treatment of multiorgan failure.",I,E

In selecting data for inclusion, the author gave preference to full-length articles published in peer-reviewed journals.; Like other PPIs, pantoprazole exerts its pharmacodynamic actions by binding to the proton pump (H+,K+ -adenosine triphosphatase) in the parietal cells, but, compared with other PPIs, its binding may be more specific for the proton pump. Pantoprazole is well absorbed when administered as an enteric-coated, delayed-release tablet, with an oral bioavailability of approximately 77%. It is hepatically metabolized via cytochrome P2C19 to hydroxypantoprazole, an inactive metabolite that subsequently undergoes sulfate conjugation. The elimination half-life ranges from 0.9 to 1.9 hours and is independent of dose. Pantoprazole has similar efficacy to other PPIs in the healing of gastric and duodenal ulcers, as well as erosive esophagitis, and as part of triple-drug regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori from the gastric mucosa. It is well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being headache, diarrhea, flatulence, and abdominal pain. In clinical studies, it has been shown to have no interactions with various other agents, including carbamazepine, cisapride, cyclosporine, digoxin, phenytoin, theophylline, and warfarin.; Pantoprazole appears to be as effective as other PPIs.

The pharmaceutical industry has capitalized on the identification of two different isoforms of cyclooxygenase, enabling the development of specific inhibitors of one isoform that minimizes prostaglandin-dependent mechanisms that contribute to NSAID-induced injury. Clinical trials support the efficacy and reduced toxicity of these agents. Because acid exacerbates the injury initiated by NSAIDs, potent acid suppressive therapy, typically with proton pump inhibitors, is another common approach to the treatment of NSAID-related dyspepsia as well as NSAID-induced ulcer disease.; Recent improvements in the understanding of NSAID-induced damage and new drug development have provided the opportunity for effective anti-inflammatory therapy with reduced GI toxicity.

An unanswered question is whether these changes may regress under long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). This fact prompted us to investigate the effect of PPI treatment on the histological changes observed in the lower oesophagus.; 295 patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive GORD were investigated by endoscopy/biopsy prior to and during the course of a 12-month PPI treatment regimen (8 weeks acute treatment with 30 mg lansoprazole/day followed by long-term treatment with 15 or 30 mg lansoprazole or 20 mg omeprazole/day). The parameters studied were the frequency of ulcers and erosions and the hyperplasia of the basal cell layer and elongation of the papillae prior to treatment and on day 56 (D56), after 6 months (M6) and after 12 months (M12) of treatment.; In the various treatment groups, the results showed no statistically significant differences. Ulcers and erosions (prior to treatment 21% and 31%, respectively) were detected statistically significantly less frequently under PPI treatment (ulcers, D56: 1%, M6 and M12, 0%; erosions, D56: 2%, M6: 4%, M12, 3%). While high-grade hyperplasia of the basal cell layer and elongation of the papillae was found in 51% of the cases prior to treatment, the corresponding figures were only 3% (D56, M6) and 2% (M12). In contrast, the percentage of cases with normal oesophageal epithelium increased from 8% before treatment to 55% (D56), 66% (M6) and 63% (M12).; Our study shows not only that erosions and ulcers heal under PPI treatment, but also that hyperplasia of the basal cell layer and elongation of papillae in the squamous epithelium of the oesophageal mucosa may normalize, and are thus presumably not 'normal physiological variants'.",I,E

In patients with GERD symptoms and/or mild esophagitis, the best and most cost-effective therapeutic strategy is to start with a proton pump inhibitor with subsequent trial of step down of the intensity of therapy (e.g. H2-receptor antagonists). In patients with moderate or severe esophagitis, proton pump inhibitors are the mainstay of treatment and the most effective in preventing symptoms and esophagitis. In patients with mild disease, the recurrence of symptoms is less frequent and many patients may not need continuous maintenance therapy or may require treatment with either low dose proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists or cisapride only. H. pylori eradication might be needed in GERD patients on long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors, but the benefit of this strategy has not yet been adequately demonstrated. Antireflux surgery is a maintenance option for the young patient on long-term medical therapy. Improved medical therapy for GERD might depend on future agents with different therapeutic targets, including GABA inhibitors and nitric oxide modulating drugs in the control of the lower sphincter esophagus and in motility disorders, free radical scavengers in the prevention of mucosal damage and COX-2 specific inhibitors in the prevention of the progression of Barret's esophagus to adenocarcinoma.

Patients were typically adults with asthma and concurrent symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux who received interventions that included pharmacological therapy, conservative management, and surgery. The following outcome measures were assessed: lung function, peak expiratory flow, asthma symptoms, asthma medications, and nocturnal asthma.; From 22 potentially relevant published and unpublished randomised controlled trials, 12 were included. Treatment duration ranged from 1 week to 6 months. Eight trials reported that treatment improved at least one asthma outcome, but these outcomes differed between trials. Overall, treatment of reflux oesophagitis did not consistently improve forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), peak expiratory flow rate, asthma symptoms, nocturnal asthma symptoms, or use of asthma medications in asthmatic subjects. Significant improvement in wheeze was reported in two studies.; The published literature does not consistently support treatment of reflux oesophagitis as a means of controlling asthma. Further large randomised controlled trials in subjects with a demonstrated temporal relationship between gastro-oesophageal reflux and asthma are needed.

Medical costs for hospitalizations, procedures, and office visits reflected 1998 Medicare payments. The 1-year maintenance model accounted for drug-class switching and symptomatic, rather than endoscopic, recurrences. Effectiveness was reported as the percentage of patients in whom a symptomatic recurrence was prevented. The cost per symptomatic recurrence prevented was reported as an average and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.; The per-patient cost of RAB therapy was higher than that of RAN therapy ($2020 vs $1917); RAB therapy, however, was more effective than RAN therapy in preventing symptomatic recurrences (74% vs 41%). The average cost-effectiveness ratio was lower for RAB therapy than for RAN therapy ($2748 per symptomatic recurrence prevented vs $4719 per symptomatic recurrence prevented). The cost of preventing one additional symptomatic recurrence with RAB rather than RAN was $313 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio). Sensitivity analysis conducted on key clinical and cost variables supported the robustness of the decision model.; This analysis demonstrates that management of esophagitis with RAB is more effective, and may be more cost effective, than management with generic RAN, despite RAB's higher per-unit cost.",I,E

11190068,The role of economic evaluation in the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.,Cost-Benefit Analysis; Health Care Costs; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Humans; Mass Screening,"Fendrick, A M","The unfolding of the H. pylori story coupled with the high prevalence and economic burden associated with upper gastrointestinal symptoms makes H. pylori-associated disorders an ideal candidate for economic evaluation. As a result of the high quality and quantity of data emerging, H. pylori eradication is cost-effective in individuals with either newly diagnosed or past PUD. The role of eradication in other areas, for example, patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and screening to prevent gastric cancer, may never be worked out to some clinicians' satisfaction. Conflicting reports and the lack of definitive clinical trials have frustrated clinicians. H. pylori diagnosis and treatment have not been integrated into everyday clinical practice. As a result, the enormous potential benefits associated with H. pylori eradication have not been achieved. Economic evaluation is not a panacea to the problems confronting medical services delivery. Assessments of medical practice are methodologically challenging, time-consuming, and expensive. Once the answers are in, it remains difficult to alter an individual provider's patterns of care and integrate the research findings into everyday practice. Further research into physician decision making is necessary to complement the advances being made in determining the value of medical interventions. The fruits of these efforts will be the more efficient delivery of health care services, which, it is hoped, ultimately will improve the health of patients. There is no reason to believe, however, that more attention to effectiveness research would lead to a reduction in health care expenditures. Increasing demands for accountability of medical interventions will propel effectiveness movements. Economic analyses, performed in concert with carefully designed clinical studies, will spur more critical review of health care resource allocation decisions. Despite the limitations, the findings generated from effectiveness research will have a major impact on physician practices, guideline development, and reimbursement decisions. The tendency of clinicians not to pay attention to economic evaluations may lead to missed clinical benefits and unnecessary expenditures. Physicians who have been reluctant to appreciate the information provided by economic evaluation must understand what other stakeholders in health care delivery already have accepted: that the rational basis for cost-effectiveness analysis is the overall improvement in the quality of health care services--not simply a tool to reduce health care costs.",E,E

The strong association between Barrett's oesophagus and chronic GERD suggests that abnormal oesophageal acid exposure plays an important role in this condition. The progression of Barrett's oesophagus from specialized intestinal metaplasia to dysplasia and finally invasive carcinoma is incompletely understood, but increased and disordered proliferation is a key cellular event. In ex vivo organ culture experiments, cell proliferation is increased after exposure to short pulses of acid, whilst proliferation is reduced in Barrett's oesophagus specimens taken from patients with oesophageal acid exposure normalized by antisecretory therapy. In long-term clinical studies, consistent and profound intra-oesophageal acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors decreases cell proliferation and increases differentiation in Barrett's oesophagus, but the clinical importance of such favourable effects on these surrogate markers is not clear. In clinical practice, proton pump inhibitors relieve symptoms and induce partial regression to squamous epithelium, but abnormal oesophageal acid exposure and the risk for dysplasia or adenocarcinoma persist in many patients. The ability of proton pump inhibitors to suppress acid profoundly and consistently may be critical in the long-term management of Barrett's oesophagus.",E,E

Both luminal and mucosal growth of non-H. pylori bacteria were significantly greater in H. pylori-positive than -negative patients taking proton pump inhibitors (P < 0.05 for both). Luminal growth of non-H. pylori flora increased with the intragastric pH level, whilst mucosal bacterial growth increased with the duration of acid inhibition.; Non-H. pylori flora not only contaminates the gastric juice but also colonizes the gastric mucosa of a large proportion of patients treated long-term with acid inhibition. The relationship between H. pylori and non-H. pylori bacteria in the pathogenesis of atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer needs further elucidation.",3,E

Economic data were derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Employment Management Association, and published sources. Work-loss data were taken from the National Center for Health Statistics' Health Interview Survey. The indirect cost was calculated as the sum of the costs due to morbidity and mortality. From the perspective of the employer, morbidity costs come from lost productivity, idle assets, and nonwage factors resulting from absenteeism and mortality costs are expenditures for replacing and retraining workers. This differs from calculations from the societal perspective, in which indirect costs are the value of an individual's lost income--both current and potential.; The total indirect cost of ischemic heart disease to employers in private industry was $182.74 per enrollee. Ninety-five percent of the indirect cost was the consequence of work loss due to morbidity rather than of mortality costs.; From the perspective of the employer, the indirect cost of ischemic heart disease is overwhelmingly due to morbidity costs.",E,E

Achalasia is a disorder of the lower esophageal sphincter and the smooth musculature of the esophageal body. In achalasia the lower esophageal sphincter typically fails to relax with swallowing, and the esophageal body fails to undergo peristalsis. In contrast to spastic disorders of the esophagus, achalasia can be progressive and cause pronounced morbidity. Pseudoachalasia mimics achalasia in terms of symptoms but can be caused by infectious disorders or malignancy. Treatment for achalasia is nonstandardized and includes medical, endoscopic, and surgical options. Spastic disorders of the esophagus, such as diffuse esophageal spasm and nutcracker esophagus, and nonspecific esophageal motility disorder are benign and nonprogressive, with similar findings on esophageal manometry. Although the exact cause remains unknown, these disorders may represent a manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Treatment of spastic disorders includes medical and surgical approaches and is aimed at symptomatic relief.",E,E

After a washout period of 5-14 days, the same doses (20 mg as a solution and 40 mg as a capsule) were given orally for 5 days and then again intravenously on day 6. Blood samples for determination of esomeprazole and its metabolites were collected 12 h or 24 h post-dose and were analysed using normal-phase liquid chromatography with ultraviolet (UV) detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters of esomeprazole and its metabolites were estimated using non-compartmental analysis. Geometric means and ratios of the geometric means together with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using analysis of variance (ANOVA).; Plasma clearance (CL) of esomeprazole decreased from 22 l/h to 16 l/h and from 17 l/h to 9 l/h following repeated dosing of 20 mg and 40 mg, respectively. Total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased (from 1.34 micromol x h/l to 2.55 micromol x h/l) with absolute bioavailability (F) being 50% on day 1 and 68% on day 5 after the 20-mg oral dose. AUC increased (from 4.32 micromol x h/l to 11.21 micromol x h/l) with F being 64% on day 1 and 89% on day 5 after the 40-mg oral dose. The plasma levels for esomeprazole sulphone were substantially higher on day 5 than on day 1, while those for 5-hydroxy esomeprazole were marginally higher on day 5 than on day 1 following repeated oral dosing of 40 mg esomeprazole. No side effects attributable to esomeprazole were noticed.; The increased AUC of esomeprazole with repeated dosing is probably due to a combination of a decreased first-pass elimination and a decreased systemic clearance.",I,E

Given the simultaneous decline in Helicobacter pylori infection, it is tempting to propose a relationship between H. pylori infection and these opposing time trends. Although H. pylori infection clearly does not cause GERD, it may protect certain susceptible individuals from developing GERD and its complications. The most likely mechanism in which H. pylori infection protects against GERD is by decreasing the potency of the gastric refluxate in patients with corpus predominant gastritis. A variety of implications of H. pylori infection on GERD treatment have also arisen in recent years. These focus on the risk of gastric atrophy while on proton pump inhibitor therapy and the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors before and after eradication of H. pylori.

Neither therapy increases or reduces the risk of death from cancer and there are no compelling economic arguments favoring surgical management. Instances in which laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication should be considered include: 1) Individuals who are intolerant of proton pump inhibitor therapy because of side effects, 2) When patients are inadequately responsive to proton pump inhibitor therapy even after dosage and dose interval have been optimized, and 3) When a patient desires a permanent solution to their reflux problem that frees them of the need to chronically consume pharmaceuticals.

A direct comparison between these therapies is warranted to assess the benefits of respective therapies.; There were 310 patients with erosive esophagitis enrolled in the trial. There were 155 patients randomized to continuous omeprazole therapy and 155 to open antireflux surgery, of whom 144 later had an operation. Because of various withdrawals during the study course, 122 patients originally having an antireflux operation completed the 5-year followup; the corresponding figure in the omeprazole group was 133. Symptoms, endoscopy, and quality-of-life questionnaires were used to document clinical outcomes. Treatment failure was defined to occur if at least one of the following criteria were fulfilled: Moderate or severe heartburn or acid regurgitation during the last 7 days before the respective visit; Esophagitis of at least grade 2; Moderate or severe dysphagia or odynophagia symptoms reported in combination with mild heartburn or regurgitation; If randomized to surgery and subsequently required omeprazole for more than 8 weeks to control symptoms, or having a reoperation; If randomized to omeprazole and considered by the responsible physician to require antireflux surgery to control symptoms; If randomized to omeprazole and the patient, for any reason, preferred antireflux surgery during the course of the study. Treatment failure was the primary outcomes variable.; When the time to treatment failure was analyzed by use of the intention to treat approach, applying the life table analysis technique, a highly significant difference between the two strategies was revealed (p < 0.001), with more treatment failures in patients who originally were randomized to omeprazole treatment. The protocol also allowed dose adjustment in patients allocated to omeprazole therapy to either 40 or 60 mg daily in case of symptom recurrence. The curves subsequently describing the failure rates still remained separated in favor of surgery, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.088). Quality of life assessment revealed values within normal ranges in both therapy arms during the 5 years.; In this randomized multicenter trial with a 5-year followup, we found antireflux surgery to be more effective than omeprazole in controlling gastroesophageal reflux disease as measured by the treatment failure rates.

Major advances have been made over the past 30 years in the understanding of lower oesophageal sphincter function and the mechanism of acid secretion. Developments in surgical and pharmacological therapy have paralleled these advances. Pharmacotherapy for GERD has evolved from antacids to H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) to prokinetics to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The H2RAs, while modestly effective in symptom relief and healing of GERD, are limited by pharmacological tolerance. The prokinetics (metoclopramide and cisapride) are limited by low efficacy, pharmacological tolerance and toxicity. The PPIs have emerged as the most effective therapy for symptom relief, healing and long-term maintenance. They have also proved to be remarkably safe and cost-effective in long-term therapy. This review evaluates the pharmacology, efficacy, tolerability, safety and cost-effectiveness of the four currently available PPIs, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole, in the treatment of GERD.",E,E

Chronic H. pylori infection causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer diseases and even gastric cancer. Cure of the infection leads to healing of gastric inflammation, prevention of development of peptic ulcer, as well as accelerated healing of peptic ulcers, and prevention of ulcer recurrence. Treatment of H. pylori has undergone substantial evolution over the past decade. Despite the in vitro susceptibility, results from single or even dual drug therapy is typically unsatisfactory and the best therapy is yet to be defined. The best current therapies for H. pylori infection consist of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or ranitidine bismuth citrate and two antibiotics (triple therapies), or bismuth, tetracycline, metronidazole and a PPI (quadruple therapy). Clarithromycin is one of the most useful antimicrobials against H. pylori. It is an acid-stable macrolide with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, well absorbed with a wide tissue distribution and with mild side effects. Clarithromycin has a low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) for H. pylori and its effect is potentiated by acid inhibition. When combined with a PPI or ranitidine bismuth citrate and amoxicillin or metronidazole, eradication rates of more than 95% can be achieved with susceptible organisms. However, the prevalence of primary and acquired clarithromycin resistance, which is due to mutations within a conserved loop of 23S rRNA of H. pylori, is increasing. In practice, the presence of clarithromycin resistance usually implies reduced success when clarithromycin-containing regimes are used. There is a need for improved therapies for H. pylori where antibiotic resistance is less of a problem.",E,E

They were taking for two weeks only omeprazole (n = 17), or omeprazole in combination with either amoxycillin or amoxycillin and tinidazole (n = 22). Salivary secretion was assessed before and at the end of the treatment, both in basal conditions and during a gastric secretory test. Gastric secretion was monitored concurrently with salivary flow rate. Additionally gastritis score and serum gastrin levels were assessed.; Basal salivary secretions remained unchanged in patients on omeprazole monotherapy, but decreased in five of eight saliva collection periods in patients on eradication regimens. During the gastric secretory test, salivary secretions fell in both groups, but only after pentagastrin stimulation (in one collection period in patients on omeprazole, and in three collection periods in patients on eradication therapy). The observed changes in salivary secretion were inversely related to the pre-treatment gastric pH values.; The influence of omeprazole and omeprazole-based eradication therapies on salivary flow rate is presumably secondary to changes in gastric pH values and is likely to be related to oesophago-salivary reflex generation.",E,E

The irreversible inactivation of the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme by lansoprazole controls the secretion rate of H+ ions and gastric pH values. The basal circadian rhythm of gastric acid production was taken into account as well as the effects of food intake. A model was applied to multiple-dose data from a crossover study of four dosage regimens of lansoprazole in two groups of normal male subjects. Model parameters were estimated by nonlinear regression and were compared to historical values reported in the literature. The predicted mean gastric ion concentration was 23.2 mM (pH 1.6) with the peak time at 12.6 hours (8:30 p.m.), and the half-time for H+ removal from the stomach averaged 1.7 hours. The estimated half-life of gastric food removal was 0.8 hours. The rate constant for normal H+/K+-ATPase degradation was 0.045 h(-1). The pharmacodynamic parameter describing lansoprazole action on gastric acid secretion was the second-order enzyme inactivation constant, which averaged 0.16 microg(-1) x L x h(-1). The parameters obtained for both the baseline and drug treatment data were consistent with the literature and physiologically relevant with the exception of effective food volume, which was large presumably due to buffer effects. The model successfully incorporated the physiological regulation of gastric acid production, the effects of food on gastric acid, and the effects of multiple-dosing regimens of lansoprazole on gastric acid production to give reasonable profiles of gastric pH.",E,E

Circumstantial evidence continues to suggest that infection with Helicobacter pylori may protect some patients from developing GERD and its complications. An empirical trial of a proton-pump inhibitor may now be a reasonable alternative to endoscopy or 24-hour pH testing for the diagnosis of GERD. Long-term follow-up data covering more than over a decade indicate that proton-pump inhibitors are effective and safe agents for the treatment of GERD. Furthermore, a strategy of proton-pump inhibitors first may be the most cost-effective approach to GERD. It remains unclear why some patients with GERD develop Barrett's esophagus, whereas others do not. Recent studies demonstrate the importance of pulses of acid or bile in increasing cell proliferation and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in Barrett's epithelium cell cultures. Short-segment Barrett's esophagus is now clearly associated with an increased risk of dysplasia or cancer compared to intestinal metaplasia of the cardia, and the cancer risk in this condition is similar to that with long-segment Barrett's esophagus. However, the overall cancer risk in patients with Barrett's esophagus is lower than previously estimated, at approximately 0.5% annually.

All patients had pathologic esophageal acid exposure by 24-hour pH study, a 2 cm or smaller hiatal hernia, grade 2 or less esophagitis, and no significant dysmotility or dysphagia. RF energy was delivered with a catheter and thermocouple-controlled generator to create submucosal thermal lesions in the muscle of the GEJ. GERD symptoms and quality of life were assessed at 0, 1, 4, and 6 months with the short-form health survey (SF-36). Anti-secretory medications were withdrawn 7 days before each assessment of symptoms and pH/motility study. Medication use, endoscopic findings, esophageal acid exposure, and motility were assessed at 0 and 6 months.; Thirty-two men and 15 women underwent treatment. At 6 months there were improvements in the median heartburn score (4 to 1, p < or = 0.0001), GERD score (26 to 7, p < or = 0.0001), satisfaction (1 to 4, p < or = 0.0001), mental SF-36 (46.2 to 55.5, p = 0.01), physical SF-36 (41.1 to 51.9, p < or = 0.0001), and esophageal acid exposure (11.7% to 4.8%, p < or = 0.0001). Esophagitis was present in 25 patients before treatment (15 grade 1 and 10 grade 2) and 8 had esophagitis at 6 months (4 grade 1 and 4 grade 2, p = 0.005). At 6 months, 87% no longer required proton pump inhibitor medication. There was no significant change in median lower esophageal sphincter pressure (14.0 to 12.0 mm Hg, p = 0.19), peristaltic amplitude (64 to 66 mm Hg, p = 0.71), or lower esophageal sphincter length (3.0 to 3.0, p = 0.28). There were 3 self-limited complications (fever for 24 hours, odynophagia lasting for 5 days, and a linear mucosal injury that was healed after 3 weeks).; RF energy delivery significantly improved GERD symptoms, quality of life, and esophageal acid exposure while eliminating the need for anti-secretory medication in the majority of patients with a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical disease severity but with minimal active esophagitis or hiatal hernia.",E,E

Treatment costs included drug acquisition and the management of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects, classified as GI discomfort, symptomatic ulcer, anaemia and serious GI events (requiring hospitalisation). Probabilities were derived from celecoxib clinical trials and the literature. Drug utilisation patterns and treatment costs reflecting Swiss practice were obtained from local sources. Analysis was from the public health insurers' perspective. A range of sensitivity analyses was performed.; For the base case of patients at typical risk (0.56% per 6 months) of serious GI events, the total expected costs of 6 months' treatment were as follows: celecoxib 435 Swiss francs (SwF); NSAID alone SwF510; diclofenac/misoprostol SwF522; and other protected NSAID regimens between SwF1034 and SwF1415. Celecoxib remained the lowest costing treatment over all categories of GI risk. Celecoxib generated 115 expected adverse events per 1000 patients per 6 months, followed by NSAID + PPI (119), NSAID + H2RA (154), NSAID + misoprostol (202), diclofenac/misoprostol (203), and NSAID alone (220), again for the base case. The cost per adverse event averted for celecoxib compared with NSAIDs alone was estimated in a stochastic version of the model using Monte Carlo simulation. In 95% of 500 iterations, celecoxib was predicted to save both costs and adverse events, thus dominating NSAIDs alone; the maximum cost per adverse event averted was SwF440.; Celecoxib is predicted to be the most cost effective of the treatments considered for managing arthritis patients in Switzerland. A policy of switching patients from NSAIDs to celecoxib is predicted to be cost saving for public health insurers, while reducing the burden of iatrogenic GI side effects. Greater cost savings would be realised when patients are switched from NSAIDs used with gastroprotective agents. Models such as this can provide a useful but simplified view of treatment outcomes and predicted results require prospective validation in clinical practice.",3,E

This study was designed to further evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of esomeprazole relative to that of omeprazole in healing erosive esophagitis and resolving accompanying symptoms of GERD.; Esomeprazole 40 mg was compared with omeprazole 20 mg once daily in 2425 patients with erosive esophagitis (Helicobacter pylori negative by serology) in an 8-wk, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study conducted in 163 centers throughout the US. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with healed esophagitis at wk 8. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients healed at wk 4, resolution of heartburn at wk 4, time to first resolution and sustained resolution of heartburn, and proportion of heartburn-free days and nights. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.; Significantly more patients were healed with esomeprazole versus omeprazole at wk 8 (93.7% vs 84.2%, p < 0.001; life table estimates, intention-to-treat analysis). Healing rates at wk 4 were 81.7% and 68.7%, respectively. Esomeprazole was superior to omeprazole for all secondary measures and had a similar safety profile. The most common adverse events in both treatment groups were headache, diarrhea, and nausea.; Esomeprazole demonstrates significantly greater efficacy than omeprazole in the treatment of GERD patients with erosive esophagitis. The tolerability and safety of esomeprazole are comparable to that of omeprazole. (Am",I,I

A total of 300 patients with GERD completed questionnaires before and 6 months after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Forty-six GERD patients who continued on omeprazole served as controls. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure, 24-h pH, and quality of life (SF36) were measured at baseline and follow-up. Reproducibility was calculated as an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) from a repeated-measures analysis of variance on symptom scores (SS) on two consecutive days. Validity was established by correlating SS with 24-h pH and SF36 scores. Responsiveness was calculated as the the ratio of the mean paired difference in score in the surgical group to the within-subject variability in control subjects. Reproducibility was very high, as revealed by an ICC of 0.92. Strong correlations between SS and SF36 scores at baseline and after surgery demonstrated high cross-sectional validity. Correlation between change in SS and change in pH, SF36 pain, general health, and physical health scores demonstrated longitudinal validity. The mean (95% confidence interval) paired differences in SS were 25.6 (23.7, 27.5) in the study and 2.0 (-3.2, 7.3) in the control groups, and the responsive index was 1.0.

In some patients this results in dyspepsia and development of gastroduodenal erosions and ulceration. The risk of ulcer complications, such as bleeding, perforation and death is increased approximately 4-fold in NSAID users. Patients at high risk of ulcer complications include the elderly, those taking anticoagulants, steroids and aspirin, those with a previous history of peptic ulceration and patients with concomitant serious medical problems. The interaction of NSAIDs with Helicobacter pylori (the major cause of peptic ulceration in non-NSAID users) is controversial and some studies suggest that H. pylori infection may even protect against NSAID-induced ulceration. Selective inhibitors of the inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme spare COX-1 in the gastric mucosa and, hence, do not inhibit production of mucosal prostaglandins. COX-2-selective inhibitors are associated with a significant reduction in gastroduodenal damage compared with traditional NSAIDs. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are probably the best agents for healing and prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers. Preliminary studies suggest that COX-2 selective inhibitors, like traditional NSAIDs, may prevent lower gastrointestinal cancer. Further studies are needed but they may be useful in individuals at high risk of certain types of lower gastrointestinal malignancy with increased gastrointestinal tolerability and safety.",E,E

Eradication therapy has been incorporated into clinical practice over the past 15 years. Treatment regimens include a 2 week bismuth-based triple therapy (a bismuth compound plus metronidazole, tetracycline or amoxycillin), a 1 week proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy and a 1 week ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC)-based triple therapy (a PPI or RBC plus any two of the three antibiotics, metronidazole, amoxycillin and clarithromycin). These regimens achieve eradication rates of > 80%. H. pylori resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin decreases the clinical efficacy of most regimens, despite the high eradication rates for resistant strains achieved by the RBC-triple therapy in some recent trials. The dose of antibiotics (especially clarithromycin) and the duration of treatment may also influence the eradication rate. Doctors' beliefs impact on clinical practice and, thus, influence the clinical application of eradication therapy. Whereas peptic ulcer disease and primary gastric low-grade B-cell mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) have become established as definite indications for eradication therapy, there remain controversies surrounding non-ulcer dyspepsia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and H. pylori-related extradigestive diseases.",E,E

Reduction of acid reflux is believed to prevent progression of BE. A critical question is whether or not regression of BE occurs in response to therapy with proton pump inhibitors. The natural history of BE is altered both by the use of medications (over-the-counter or prescribed) and by endoscopic surveillance with periodic biopsies. Regression occurs when the length and surface area of BE decreases, along with the emergence of islands of squamous epithelium in the BE segment. However, the extent of regression is difficult to assess because intestinal metaplasia may underlie the islands of squamous epithelial regrowth. Sampling by endoscopic biopsy is useful in ruling out progression of BE to dysplasia or adenocarcinoma; however, complete regression of the lesion cannot be definitively proven by this technique. To date, published clinical trials of proton pump inhibitor therapy in patients with BE provide evidence of increases in squamous islands in the BE segment, but do not provide convincing data in support of complete regression of BE. In a review of prospective studies of the treatment of BE with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (with or without surgery), only 3 of 123 patients had apparent complete reversal of BE.

When evaluated clinically, patients with BE have the severest form of GERD and require aggressive therapy to control esophageal acid exposure. Both hypotension of the lower esophageal sphincter and the extent of esophageal acid exposure are major contributors to severe GERD and its complications. It is hypothesized that better control of acid will improve outcomes for BE patients. While it is clear that therapy (medical or surgical) for reflux rarely if ever results in total regression of BE, there are some limited data to support improvement in BE with control of reflux. Current medical choices include prokinetic agents, histamine type-2 receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors. In the future, genetic markers may be used in identifying BE patients at the greatest risk for histologic progression, and chemoprevention with cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may be a therapeutic option.

The incidence of developing dysplasia or cancer following surgical therapy appears to be less than with medical therapy; however, there is an insufficient number of current, randomized controlled studies to confirm this. Surveillance of BE is required regardless of treatment. This review suggests that there may be a trend in support of surgery being somewhat better than medical therapy in the prevention of BE progression and adenocarcinoma.

Patients were followed up for a total of 2 yr, with visits performed every 2 months the first year and every 6 months the following year. Endoscopies for assessment of ulcer relapse were done at 6 and 12 months or in the event of symptomatic relapse. H. pylori status was assessed by culture, immunohistochemistry, and urea breath test at entry, at 6, 12, and 24 months or at failure. The primary endpoint was discontinuation, irrespective of reason. Patients were considered H. pylori negative if all three tests were negative. Patients were considered H. pylori-positive if any of the three diagnostic tests were positive. Study staff were blinded to H. pylori results.; Thirty-two (12%) patients were H. pylori negative at entry. There were no differences according to H. pylori status for a number of clinical and demographic characteristics. However, H. pylori-negative patients had a shorter history of ulcer symptoms and were more likely to be NSAID users (19% vs 1%, p < 0.001). Only 28% of the H. pylori-negative patients completed the study, as compared with 40% of H. pylori-positive patients (p = 0.0005). The main reasons for the poorer prognosis in H. pylori-negative patients were relapse of ulcer/ulcer not healed (35% vs 26%) and relapse of severe dyspepsia symptoms without ulcer relapse (16% vs 7%). H. pylori-negative patients randomized to eradication therapy left the study early compared with H. pylori-negative patients randomized to long-term omeprazole therapy. Outcome in omeprazole-treated patients did not differ according to H. pylori status (p = 0.3).; Clinical characteristics in H. pylori-negative and positive duodenal ulcer patients differ little. Clinical outcome over 2 yr is significantly poorer in H. pylori-negative patients, especially if treated empirically with eradication therapy.

The aim of the study was to determine the influence of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on efficacy of H. pylori eradication. The study was conducted on 142 H. pylori positive peptic ulcer patients treated with either OAT-omeprazole (2 x 20 mg), amoxycillin (2 x 1000 mg), tinidazole (2 x 500 mg) (69 patients) or OAC-omeprazole (2 x 20 mg), amoxycillin (2 x 1000 mg), clarithromycin (2 x 250 mg) (73 patients). Detailed information on smoking and drinking habits was obtained from a questionnaire fulfilled by all subjects. Patients were defined as smokers if smoked 5 or more cigarettes per day and as drinkers if drank 25 g or more alcohol per week. To enter the study patients had to have confirmed H. pylori infection by two tests (CLO-test and histology). Eradication was considered successful if both tests gave negative results 4-6 weeks after the cessation of treatment. The efficacy of H. pylori eradication was similar in both groups (OAT--69.6%, OAC--78.1%). Patients who smoked cigarettes had lower rate of H. pylori eradication in OAC group (smokers 65.8%, non-smokers 91.4%, p < 0.01), while patients who drank alcohol had higher eradication rate in OAT group (drinkers 85.2%, non-drinkers 59.5%, p < 0.05). When two factors (smoking, drinking) were analyzed together, it was found that in drinkers treated with OAT, smoking did not change the efficacy of H. pylori eradication, while in non-drinkers decreased by two times (75.0% vs 38.9%, p < 0.02). In drinkers treated with OAC, smoking did not change the efficacy of H. pylori eradication (but this was likely related to the limited number of patients), while decreased it in non-drinkers from 90.0% to 65.2% (p < 0.05).

The presentation of GERD in infants and children varies from crying, irritability, or sleep disturbance to feeding difficulties, vomiting, or rumination. Helicobacter pylori (HP)-related diseases and gastric and duodenal ulcers are much more common in adults than in children, who are more likely to have gastritis or duodenitis. However, because HP infection is most likely acquired in childhood, treatment of children with endoscopically documented active HP disease may minimize the potential risk for peptic ulcer or gastric cancer in adulthood, although this is yet to be proved.; Omeprazole has been shown to be effective in the treatment of acid-related diseases. This paper reviews the literature on the use and administration of omeprazole for the treatment of GERD, peptic ulcer disease, HP infection, and other acid-related conditions in children.; Studies were identified through searches of MEDLINE and Science Citation Index for the period 1986 to November 2000, and from the reference lists of identified articles. The search terms used included omeprazole, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), children, pediatrics, routes of administration, GERD, HP infection, esophagitis, and administration. In addition, the manufacturer of omeprazole was asked for relevant unpublished information.; Marketed and extemporaneous formulations of omeprazole have been administered to children aged 2 months to 18 years for the treatment of erosive esophagitis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, HP infection, and related conditions at dosages of 5 to 80 mg/d (0.2-3.5 mg/kg/d) for periods ranging from 14 days to 36 months with a low incidence of adverse effects. The initial dose most consistently reported to heal esophagitis and provide relief of symptoms of GERD appears to be 1 mg/kg per day.; In uncontrolled clinical trials and case reports to date, omeprazole has been effective and well tolerated for the acute and chronic treatment of esophageal and peptic ulcer disease in children, particularly those who had failed to respond to previous treatment with histamine2-receptor antagonists. Should future long-term, controlled clinical trials in children demonstrate safety and efficacy, this PPI is likely to find a place in the armamentarium of pediatric pharmacotherapy.",E,E

Pantoprazole is a gastric hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K(+)-ATPase) inhibitor. It shares the same core structure as other currently available proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). The FDA-labeled indication is the short-term treatment of erosive esophagitis. PPIs act by selectively inhibiting H+/K(+)-ATPase in the secretory canaliculus of the stimulated parietal cell. Understanding the pharmacodynamics of PPIs is more relevant than knowing their pharmacokinetics, since the duration of action depends on the rate of de novo proton-pump regeneration, not the duration of drug circulation in the body. Pantoprazole is well absorbed, undergoes little first-pass metabolism, and has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 77%. Pantoprazole has been evaluated in more than 100 clinical trials involving more than 11,000 patients. It is effective in treating erosive esophagitis and duodenal and gastric ulcers. It is also effective as adjunctive treatment with antimicrobials in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori. Pantoprazole has been shown to control acid production in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Pantoprazole is well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse effects are headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The recommended oral dosage for erosive esophagitis is 40 mg once a day for up to eight weeks. The recommended i.v. dose is 40 mg given over 15 minutes once a day in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease who are unable to take oral medication. Pantoprazole appears to be as safe and effective as other PPIs in acid-related disorders.",E,E

We assigned individuals to three groups. All patients received lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily for 10 days, followed by 30 mg once daily for 8 weeks. Patients infected with H pylori received either antibiotics (clarithromycin 500 mg and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily) or placebo for the first 10 days. Controls were patients not infected with H pylori. Patients were followed up for 6 months at 2-week intervals for GORD symptoms. At the end of the study we repeated endoscopy and oesophageal and gastric 24 h-pH monitoring.; 58 of 70 patients completed our study. At the end of the study 16 of these patients were H pylori-positive (14 placebo and two eradication failures), 13 were negative because of successful H pylori eradication, and 29 were controls. H pylori-positive patients relapsed earlier (54 days) than did those in whom H pylori was eradicated (100 days) (p=0.046). The H pylori-negative control group relapsed after the longest period (110 days). However, time to relapse was also affected by oesophagitis grade (no oesophagitis 127 days, grade III or IV oesophagitis 18 days). When results were corrected for the affect of oesophagitis grade, H pylori-positive patients relapsed earlier (p=0.086) than H pylori-eradiated patients and controls (p=0.001).; H pylori infection positively affects the relapse rate of GORD.

Among patients who did not have cleared/eradicated H. pylori in the RBC and O programs, where antisecretory agents were continued beyond the antimicrobial treatment period, the number of ulcers was lower in the antisecretory plus antimicrobial subgroups compared with the antimicrobial alone subgroups (37% vs. 46% for RBC and 33% vs. 42% for O). Among patients with cleared/eradicated H. pylori, the number of patients with ulcers in the antimicrobial alone subgroups and antisecretory plus antimicrobial subgroups were similar within each program. Antimicrobials alone had significantly lower rates of ulcers among patients with cleared/eradicated H. pylori as compared with patients without clearance/eradication.; The early incidence of duodenal ulcers is significantly decreased in patients with H. pylori clearance/eradication.",E,E

To avoid complications of H pylori infection, such as the development of recurrent duodenal and gastric ulcers, effective therapies are required for eradication of the infection. This article reviews ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC), a novel complex of ranitidine, bismuth and citrate, which was developed specifically for the purpose of eradicating H pylori. Dual therapy with RBC in combination with clarithromycin for 14 days yields eradication rates of 76%. Triple therapy bid for one week with a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and either amoxicillin or a nitroimidazole (tinidazole or metronidazole) is advocated as the treatment of choice for H pylori eradication. Analogous regimens with RBC in place of proton pump inhibitors show effective eradication rates in comparative studies and with pooled data. RBC, used alone or in combination with other antibiotics, appears to be a safe and effective drug for the treatment of H pylori infection. Bismuth levels do not appear to rise to toxic levels.",3,E

Decision analysis was used to model the cost-effectiveness of PPIs on the basis of clinical trial results. Management decisions in the model were based on published U.S. guidelines and recommendations. Probability estimates were derived from a systematic review of the literature. The model's base-case scenario compared rabeprazole, lansoprazole, and omeprazole for the prevention of symptom recurrence over one year. Meta-analyzed estimates of efficacy were derived from trials by using a generalized logistic regression model with random effects. Medical costs for hospitalization, procedures, and office visits reflected 2000 Medicare payment; drug costs were based on 2000 average wholesale prices. Average costs per patient were comparable among the PPIs (rabeprazole, $1414; lansoprazole, $1671; and omeprazole, $1599). Rabeprazole prevented symptom recurrence in 86% of rabeprazole recipients, versus 68% for lansoprazole and 81% for omeprazole, and yielded the lowest average cost-effectiveness ratio (rabeprazole, $1637 per recurrence prevented; lansoprazole, $2439; and omeprazole, $1968).

Esomeprazole is the first single isomer PPI developed for the treatment of patients with acid-related diseases. In vitro experiments in human liver microsomes demonstrated that the formation of the hydroxy and 5-O-desmethyl metabolites of esomeprazole is via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19, whereas that of the sulphone metabolite is via CYP3A4. The formation rate of the hydroxy metabolite from esomeprazole is lower than for (R)-omeprazole, but that of the 2 other metabolites is higher, demonstrating stereoselective metabolism. The sum of the intrinsic clearances of all 3 metabo- lites for esomeprazole was one-third of that for (R)-omeprazole, suggesting lower clearance of esomeprazole in vivo. In vivo investigations demonstrated that esomeprazole is chirally stable after administration. Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. In normal (extensive) metabolisers with regard to CYP2C19, esomeprazole is metabolised more slowly than omeprazole, resulting in a higher area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) after administration of the same dose. This is more pronounced after repeated administration rather than after a single dose. In poor metabolisers, the AUC is lower for esomeprazole than for omeprazole, contributing to less overall interindividual variability for esomeprazole than for omeprazole. In general, esomeprazole and omeprazole are subject to the same metabolic transformations. Almost complete recoveries were reported and the ratio between urinary and faecal excretion is about 4:1 for both compounds. The dose-dependent increase in AUC of esomeprazole with repeated administration results from a combination of decreased first-pass elimination and decreased systemic clearance. Patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease exhibit a pharmacokinetic pattern similar to that in healthy individuals, whereas elderly individuals exhibited a slightly lower metabolism rate. Patients with a severe deficit in their liver function had a lower rate of metabolism, as would be expected, whereas those with mild to moderate liver disease did not exhibit any alteration in the pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole in individuals with impaired renal function is unlikely to differ from that in healthy individuals. A slight sex difference in the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole was demonstrated in that the AUC and peak plasma drug concentration were slightly, but not statistically significantly, higher in females than in males.",E,E

Despite this, a framework of understanding is emerging, which is consistent with known effects on gastric acid secretion. In patients with moderate to severe H. pylori-induced corpus gastritis, eradication can increase substantially impaired gastric acid secretion sufficiently to precipitate reflux disease in people with pre-existing sub-clinical defective gastro-oesophageal competence. By contrast, reflux disease in duodenal ulcer patients probably benefits from eradication of H. pylori. There appears to be no significant impact on reflux disease from eradication in healthy subjects or individuals whose primary problem is reflux disease. Helicobacter pylori-infected reflux disease patients respond slightly better to proton pump inhibitors. These agents cause a topographic alteration of gastritis from antrum to corpus, the clinical significance of which is controversial. Many practitioners misjudge the risks and benefits of the effects of H. pylori eradication on reflux disease. Regardless of patient diagnosis, the balance is in favour of H. pylori eradication.

No statistically significant difference could be demonstrated between the strategies or between the symptom subgroups. However, patients in the reflux-like subgroup showed a trend towards a better outcome in all empirical strategies. Ulcer-like dyspepsia seemed to benefit from omeprazole. The non-specific subgroup seemed to benefit from cisapride but also had the highest proportion of strategy failure.

Because of the extensive use of PPIs, the documentation of the potential for drug interactions with esomeprazole is of great importance. Altered absorption or metabolism are 2 of the major mechanisms for drug-drug interactions. Since intragastric pH will increase with esomeprazole treatment, it can be hypothesised that the absorption of drugs with pH-sensitive absorption (e.g. digoxin and ketoconazole) may be affected. Esomeprazole does not seem to have any potential to interact with drugs that are metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1 A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6 or 2E1. In drug interaction studies with diazepam, phenytoin and (R)-warfarin, it was shown that esomeprazole has the potential to interact with CYP2C19. The slightly altered metabolism of cisapride was also suggested to be the result of inhibition of a minor metabolic pathway for cisapride mediated by CYP2C19. Esomeprazole did not interact with the CYP3A4 substrates clarithromycin (2 studies) or quinidine. Since the slightly increased area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of cisapride could be explained as an inhibition of CYP2C19, the data on these 3 CYP3A4 substrates indicate that esomeprazole does not have the potential to inhibit this enzyme. The minor effects reported for diazepam, phenytoin, (R)-warfarin, and cisapride are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Clarithromycin interacts with the metabolism of esomeprazole resulting in a doubling of the AUC of esomeprazole. The increased plasma concentrations of esomeprazole are unlikely to have any safety implications. It can be concluded that the potential for drug-drug interactions with esomeprazole is low, and similar to that reported for omeprazole.",7,E

The prevalence of H. pylori infection, which is on the decline in Europe and in the United States, is probably related to improvements in sanitary conditions and socioeconomic status. These epidemiological data do not support a role for H. pylori in the pathogenesis of GERD, but at the same time suggest a negative association with the rising incidence in esophageal diseases. While H. pylori infection clearly does not cause GERD, it may protect certain susceptible individuals from the development of GERD and its complications. There are conflicting reports that GERD can develop after H. pylori eradication and that proton pump inhibitors are less effective in suppressing intragastric acidity in H. pylori negative patients--reasons not to eradicate H. pylori in GERD patients. On the contrary, other data suggest an increase in the development of atrophic gastritis in GERD patients (H. pylori positive) on long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy - a reason to eradicate H. pylori. Preexisting lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction, susceptibility to GERD, unmasking of latent GERD, and patterns and severity of gastritis may be important factors contributing to the development of GERD rather than just the presence or absence of infection with H. pylori.",E,E

In case of GORD relapse, patients allocated to omeprazole were offered ARS and those initially operated on had either a reoperation or were treated with omeprazole. The costs were assessed over five years from randomisation.; Differences in cumulative direct medical costs per patient between the two therapeutic strategies diminished with time. However, five year direct medical costs per patient when given omeprazole were still significantly lower than for those having ARS in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (differences were DKK 8703 (US$1475), NOK 32 992 (US$ 5155), and SEK 13 036 (US$ 1946), respectively). However, in Finland the reverse was true (the difference in favour of ARS amounted to FMK 7354 (US$ 1599)). When indirect costs (loss of production due to GORD related sick leave) were also included, the cost of surgical treatment increased substantially and exceeded the cost of medical treatment in all countries.; The total costs of medical therapy for chronic GORD were lower than those of open ARS when prospectively assessed over a five year period, although significant differences in cost estimates were revealed between countries.",E,E

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) describes the retrograde movement of gastric contents through the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) to the oesophagus. GER can occur physiologically and may be accompanied by symptoms. The introduction of endoscopes and ambulatory devices for continuous monitoring of oesophageal pH (24 h pH monitoring) has led to great improvement in the ability to diagnose reflux disease and reflux-associated complications. The development of pathological reflux and GERD can be attributed to many factors. Pathophysiology of GERD includes transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs), incompetent LES because of a decreased lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) and deficient or delayed oesophageal acid clearance. Uncomplicated GERD may be treated by modification of lifestyle and eating habits in an early stage of GERD. The various agents currently used for treatment of GERD include mucoprotective substances, antacids, H2-blockers, prokinetics and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Although these drugs are effective, they do not necessarily influence the underlying causes of the disease by improving the oesophageal clearance, increasing the LESP or reducing the frequency of TLESRs. The following article gives an overview regarding current concepts of the pathophysiology and pharmacological treatment of GERD stressing on pharmacoeconomic issues of the treatment and discusses the advantages and disadvantages for step-up and step-down therapy.",E,E

The patients recorded their daily and nocturnal symptoms of asthma, additional salbutamol use, morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) measurements in a daily chart during placebo and omeprazole treatment without changing their antiasthma treatment. Their PEFR, FEV1 values, daily and nocturnal symptoms and additional beta agonist use did not changed after omeprazole treatment except one. But their reflux symptoms (heartburn and regurgitation) were improved. As a consequence, we suggested that asthmatics which have some complaints of reflux should be searched for GER. Not the respiratory functions but GER symptoms can be improved w",E,E

A higher dose administered for a longer time-period may be effective. Antibiotics are usually combined with a proton-pump inhibitor or bismuth salt, as the only antibiotic with any in vivo activity against H. pylori in monotherapy is clarithromycin.

Three eradication regimens were given: (1) proton pump inhibitor (PPI) plus clarithromycin, plus either amoxycillin or metronidazole for 7 days (297 patients); (2) ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) plus clarithromycin plus amoxycillin for 7 days (79 patients); and (3) RBC plus clarithromycin plus amoxycillin plus metronidazole for 5 days (105 patients). H. pylori eradication was defined as a negative 13C-urea breath test 4 weeks after completing treatment.; H. pylori eradication rates were 82% (95% CI 78-87%) with PPI plus two antibiotics for 7 days, 85% (95% CI 75-91%) with RBC plus two antibiotics for 7 days, and 91% (95% CI 86-97%) with RBC plus three antibiotics for 5 days (P < 0.05 compared with the first regimen). Overall, the H. pylori eradication rate in patients with NUD was 78% (95% CI 71-84%), while in patients with PUD it was 89% (95% CI 86-93%) (P < 0.001). Both the combination of PPI plus two antibiotics for 7 days and the combination of RBC plus three antibiotics for 5 days were more effective in PUD than in NUD patients. However, RBC plus clarithromycin plus amoxycillin for 7 days was equally effective in both diseases. RBC plus two antibiotics for 7 days achieved better results than the same therapy with PPI only in NUD patients (84% v. 59%, P < 0.01), but both regimens were similar when prescribed in PUD patients (86% v. 88%). In the multivariate analysis, the type of therapy, the diagnosis (NUD v. PUD), and the product variable of therapy (with RBC plus 2 antibiotics for 7 days) and diagnosis (interaction variable) were the only variables that influenced H. pylori eradication. The odds ratio (OR) for the effect of RBC versus PPI plus two antibiotics for 7 days in patients with NUD was 4 (95% CI 1.7-9.7; P < 0.01), whereas in patients with PUD no statistical significance was achieved (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.2-3.9).; Overall, H. pylori eradication therapy is more effective in PUD than in NUD patients.

After 28 days of treatment, adequate heartburn control was reported by 58% of the nizatidine group and in 88% of the pantoprazole (p < 0.0001); erosive esophagitis healing rates were 44% for nizatidine and 79% for pantoprazole (p < 0.001). Rescue antacid was needed by a greater number of patients using nizatidine than of those using pantoprazole (p < 0.001). H. pylori infection was associated with an increased probability of erosive esophagitis healing.; Pantoprazole once daily was superior to nizatidine b.i.d. in producing complete heartburn relief in a mixed population of GERD patients and in achieving erosion healing. The proportions of patients with complete symptom relief were greater with pantoprazole after 7 days of therapy than with nizatidine after 28 days.

Accuracy of the rapid urease test was estimated in accordance with results obtained with other diagnostic methods.; Lesions causing gastrointestinal bleeding were 56 duodenal ulcers, 13 gastric ulcers, 7 pyloric channel ulcers, 13 acute lesions of the gastric mucosa and 16 erosive duodenitis. H. pylori infection was present in 68 patients (87.2%). Forty-four patients had received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The sensitivity/specificity (%) of the diagnostic methods was 48.5/100 for the rapid urease test, 91/77.8 for the breath test, 89.5/80 for serology and 86.3/100 for histology. The prior consumption of proton-pump inhibitors and antibiotics induced false-negative results in the rapid urease test and breath test, with no effect on serology and histology.; The prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding from peptic lesions is high. Sensitivity of the rapid urease test for diagnosing H. pylori is low in this setting. Cases with negative rapid urease test need the combination of two or more additional tests if diagnosis is to be achieved.

Factors such as previous exposure to NSAIDs, a history of ulcer complication, concurrent use of acid-suppressant therapy, and the difference between NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin all affect the outcome. Several recommendations can be made with regard to the indications of H. pylori eradication for patients requiring NSAIDs. First, patients taking NSAIDs who have ulcers or previous ulcer disease should be tested for the bacterium, and it should be eradicated if present because it is impossible to determine whether the ulcers are caused by H. pylori or NSAIDs or both. Antiulcer drugs should be prescribed to prevent ulcer recurrence for patients who continue to require NSAIDs. Although the efficacy of omeprazole is enhanced by H. pylori infection, it is not justified to leave a pathogen in the stomach in exchange for a modest therapeutic gain. Second, for patients who take low-dose aspirin, eradication of H. pylori substantially reduces the risk of ulcer bleeding. It is advisable that patients taking low-dose aspirin who are at risk of ulcer bleeding should be tested for H. pylori and treated for it if the infection is found. Third, for patients who are about to start NSAIDs, screen-and-treat H. pylori has the potential of reducing the ulcer risk at an affordable incremental cost. It might be argued that any interaction between H. pylori and NSAIDs would become irrelevant in the era of COX-2-selective NSAIDs. Even among patients who are receiving a COX-2-selective NSAID, however, a large-scale study showed that the ulcer risk is significantly higher in H. pylori-positive patients than in uninfected patients. This finding suggests that the relative importance of H. pylori in ulcer development might increase with a reduced toxicity of COX-2-selective NSAIDs. With an increasing use of low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis, the problem of aspirin-related ulcer disease is expected to rise. Given the significant role of H. pylori in the latter condition, screen-and-treat H. pylori might be a useful strategy for the prevention of ulcer complications in high-risk patients receiving low-dose aspirin in the future.",E,E

It causes dose-dependent inhibition of acid secretion. In 8-week studies, among patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), rabeprazole 20 mg/day or 10mg twice daily was as effective as omeprazole and superior to ranitidine in the healing of GORD. Symptom relief with rabeprazole was superior to that provided by placebo and ranitidine and similar to omeprazole. In long-term trials rabeprazole 10 mg/day was similar to omeprazole 20 mg/day in a 2-year study and superior to placebo in 1-year studies, in both the maintenance of healing and prevention of symptoms in patients with healed GORD. In nonerosive GORD, 4-week studies have shown rabeprazole to be more effective than placebo in relieving heartburn and various other gastrointestinal symptoms. Data among patients with Barrett's oesophagus suggest rabeprazole 20 mg/day may be more effective than placebo in maintaining healing of associated oesophagitis after 1 year of treatment. One-week triple Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy with rabeprazole plus clarithromycin and amoxicillin achieved eradication rates of > or =85%. Rabeprazole is as effective as omeprazole and lansoprazole when included as part of a triple-therapy regimen for the eradication of H. pylori. Eradication rates of >90% were achieved when rabeprazole 20 to 40 mg/day was included as part of a quadruple eradication regimen. As monotherapy for peptic ulcer healing and symptom relief, 4- to 8-week studies have shown rabeprazole 10 to 40 mg/day to be superior to placebo and ranitidine and have similar efficacy to omeprazole. Preliminary 1-year data among 16 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome suggest rabeprazole 60 to 120 mg/day can resolve and prevent the recurrence of symptoms and endoscopic lesions associated with this condition. In clinical trials of up to 2 years' duration the tolerability of rabeprazole is similar to that of placebo, ranitidine and omeprazole. Common adverse events assigned to rabeprazole have been diarrhoea, headache, rhinitis, nausea, pharyngitis and abdominal pain. Histological changes and increases in serum gastrin levels were unremarkable and typical of proton pump inhibitors. No dosage adjustment is necessary in renal and mild to moderate hepatic impairment.; Rabeprazole is a well tolerated proton pump inhibitor. It has proven efficacy in healing, symptom relief and prevention of relapse of peptic ulcers and GORD and can form part of effective H. pylori eradication regimens. It is an important alternative to H(2) antagonists and an additional treatment option to other proton pump inhibitors in the management of acid-related disorders.",E,E

Identified by Marshall and Warren in 1982 [1,2], this bacterium seems aetiologically related to many gastric diseases, previously known as 'acid related diseases'. Compelling evidence demonstrates that Hp is the most important aetiological agent of gastritis [3], the principal causal factor in peptic ulcer [4], contributes to the genesis of gastric cancer [5] and has a critical role in the development of many mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas [6]. Although experimental data have recently provided hard evidence to support the role of Hp in the genesis of gastritis, ulcer and carcinoma [7], a critical argument for Hp generating peptic ulcer disease has been, in fact, the change in the natural history of peptic ulcer that follows the cure of the infection.",E,E

The lesions considered were gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers and erosive gastritis. All patients were candidates for medical treatment. The parameters assessed included: 1) stabilisation of the lesion by repeat endoscopy at 7.0 +/- 3.0 days, 2) bleeding recurrence, 3) duration of stay in the intermediate medical care unit. For erosive gastritis only parameters 2 and 3 were considered. The study was limited to the hospitalisation period. Endoscopic stabilisation rate at 7.0 +/- 3.0 days for duodenal lesions was higher in the omeprazole group (71% vs 37%, p=0.03), but there was no significant difference for gastric lesions (50% vs 54%, NS).

New diagnostic tests for H. pylori infection have been evaluated, and rescue therapies for failed H. pylori eradication have been tested. The causal relationship between H. pylori infection and nonulcer dyspepsia, gastric cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and NSAID-related ulcers remained heated topics of debate. In 2000, landmark clinical trials and meta-analyses were published addressing these issues. The role of endoscopy in managing nonulcer dyspepsia was better defined. The role of H. pylori eradication in NSAID/aspirin users was reexamined in high-risk patients. Clinical benefit was finally confirmed for specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The millennium year turned out to be a very important one in the advancement of knowledge in this field.",E,E

This agent is approved for the short-term treatment of erosive reflux oesophagitis, active gastric ulcer, active duodenal ulcer and the treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. It is also approved for the long-term treatment of healed reflux oesophagitis, healed duodenal ulcer, the treatment of hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and the eradication of Helicobacter pylori as a component of triple therapy with lansoprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin, or dual therapy with lansoprazole and amoxicillin. Its mechanism of action is to selectively inhibit the membrane enzyme H+/K+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells. In clinical trials, lansoprazole is more effective than placebo or histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis. Lansoprazole administered at a dose of 30 mg daily produced faster relief of symptoms and superior healing rates in patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers or reflux oesophagitis than H2-receptor antagonists. A daily dose of 30 mg lansoprazole reduced epigastric pain faster than omeprazole 20 mg daily in patients with peptic ulcer disease but healing rates at 4 and 8 weeks were similar with both agents at these dosages. Lansoprazole was more effective than H2-receptor antagonists in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and produced similar treatment outcome to omeprazole. Lansoprazole in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin produced similar rates of eradication of H. pylori. In clinical trials, lansoprazole is well-tolerated and has a low frequency of side effects similar to that of H2-receptor antagonists or omeprazole.",7,E

Considering the limitations of classifications currently in use, a new classification is proposed that combines three criteria-clinical, endoscopic, and pH-metric-providing a comprehensive and more complete characterization of the disease. The diagnosis begins with the presence of heartburn, acid regurgitation, and alarm manifestations (dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, GI bleeding, nausea and/or vomiting, and family history of cancer). Also, atypical esophageal, pulmonary, otorhinolaryngological, and oral symptoms may occur. Endoscopy is the first approach, particularly in patients over 40 yr of age and in those with alarm symptoms. Other exams are considered in particular cases, such as contrast radiological examination, scyntigraphy, manometry, and prolonged pH measurement. The clinical treatment encompasses behavioral modifications in lifestyle and pharmacological measures. Proton pump inhibitors in manufacturers' recommended doses are indicated, with doubling of the dose in more severe cases of esophagitis. The minimum time of administration is 6 wk. Patients who do not respond to medical treatment, including those with atypical manifestations, should be considered for surgical treatment. Of the complications of gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus presents a potential development of adenocarcinoma; biopsies should be performed, independent of Barrett's esophagus extent or location. In this regard the designation ""short Barrett's"" is not important in terms of management and prognosis.",E,E

Fibrin glue might be an ideal injection agent, based on its physiologic properties, despite its demanding injection technique and high cost. The aim of this study was to determine whether the injection of fibrin glue in combination with epinephrine improves outcome for patients at high risk of recurrent bleeding.; Patients were prospectively randomized to injection of epinephrine alone (n = 70) or epinephrine plus fibrin glue (n = 65). Endoscopy was repeated daily until the ulcer base was clean. All patients were treated with high-dose omeprazole.; Initial hemostasis was 100% in both groups. There was no significant overall difference in rates of recurrent bleeding (24.3% and 21.5%, respectively, for epinephrine and epinephrine plus fibrin). When patients were stratified according to Forrest criteria, no significant difference could be found, although there was a trend toward less recurrent bleeding after fibrin injection of actively bleeding ulcers. There was no significant difference in the proportions of patients who required surgery (10% and 6%, respectively, for epinephrine and epinephrine plus fibrin). Mortality was the same (3%) in each group.; Adding fibrin glue to epinephrine for injection treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers does not improve outcome.

Analysis by gender suggested a statistically significant dyspepsia cost saving in men (27.17 ponds sterling per subject; 95% confidence interval, 50.01 pounds sterling to 4.32 pounds sterling; P=0.02), with no benefit in women (-4.46 per subject; 95% confidence interval, -33.85 pounds sterling to 24.93 pounds sterling). Modelling of these data suggested that population H. pylori screening and treatment for 1,000,000 45-year-olds would save over 6,000,000 pounds sterling and 1300 years of life. The programme would cost 14, 200 pounds sterling per life year saved if the health service dyspepsia cost savings were the lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals and H. pylori eradication had only a 10% efficacy in reducing mortality from distal gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease.; Modelling suggests that population H. pylori screening and treatment are likely to be cost-effective and could be the first cost-neutral screening programme.

Low DU recurrences and reinfection rates were universally described, when treatment was effective. It has been suggested that short-term triple therapy, comprising a proton pump inhibitor plus 2 antibiotics (clarithromycin, amoxycillin or a nitroimidazole), should be used as first choice in treating H. pylori infection. Nevertheless, conflicting results have been reported on using these treatment regimens in different countries. Our aim was to compare cure rates of H. pylori infection, with a 1-week triple therapy versus 10 and 15 day triple schedules, in patients with DU.; A total of 172 patients (91 males, mean age 56.2+/- 3.2 years) were randomly treated with a triple therapy including a standard dose of proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin at a dose of 1 g twice daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day. Sixty-six patients received a 1-week triple therapy (group I), 42 subjects were treated with a 10-day triple therapy (group II) and 64 others with a 14-day triple therapy (group III). H. pylori infection at entry and after eradication, at least 4 weeks after therapy had ended, were assessed by 13C urea breath test and histology on biopsies from the antrum and the corpus.; At the end of the course of treatment, the overall H. pylori eradication rate was 68.2% (45/66) in group I, 76.2% (32/42) in group II and 71.9% (46/64) in group III, without any statistically significant difference between the 3 differing period regimens, although a trend for better results with the 10-day triple therapy was observed.

Our aim was to investigate the effect of community based Hp eradication for patients with chronic peptic ulcer disease requiring maintenance acid suppression. The endpoints used were the patients dyspeptic symptoms and the requirement for the prescription of maintenance acid suppression therapy. The study area covered seven general practices in the Glasgow area. Patients with previously diagnosed peptic ulcer disease receiving prescribed acid suppression therapy were invited to a dyspepsia clinic. Hp status was assessed by Helisal rapid blood test (HRBT). Positive patients received Hp eradication therapy and were reviewed six weeks later. At six months a review of practice records was carried out, and two years after eradication a postal questionnaire was sent to participating patients. A total of 243 patients attended the initial clinic of which 81.9% were HRBT positive. 156 of 196 patients offered Hp eradication re-attended at six weeks. The per protocol eradication rate was 91.7%. After six months patients who had received eradication therapy were less likely to require maintenance acid suppression therapy compared with those to whom eradication was not given. Two years after treatment 76.5% of patients felt their symptoms were improved, but 42.2% were still receiving maintenance therapy. The estimated cost of treatment per month per patient had fallen from 20.23 Pounds to 9.39 Pounds after eradication. In conclusion we felt that community based Hp eradication for patients with chronic PU disease is effective, however it does not completely alleviate dyspepsia. Predictors of symptomatic response or of no longer requiring acid suppression therapy after two years were younger age of onset of PU disease and absence of pre-documented gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or hiatus hernia. Hp eradication improves patients symptoms, reduces the requirement for maintenance acid suppression and is cost-effective after two years follow-up in this targeted group.",3,E

Ablation plus antireflux therapy has recently been advocated to prevent the development of adenocarcinoma or to treat those unfit or unwilling to undergo esophagectomy. The present article, based on a search of Medline/ISI databases and cross-referencing of relevant articles, reviews the literature on this subject. A number of techniques have been used to remove the affected mucosa, including laser, electrocoagulation, argon plasma coagulation and photodynamic therapy but, as yet, none has been shown to be superior. Depending on the method used, ablation results in complete removal of Barrett's esophagus in approximately one third of patients and a partial response in nearly two-thirds. The resultant squamous mucosa is apparently 'normal' but may regress. To promote and maintain regeneration, antireflux therapy must be sufficient to reduce repetitive injury to the esophageal mucosa. Whether ablation reduces the cancer risk or delays its occurrence is unknown, though recent data suggests benefit. Complications are infrequent and usually mild. Regular follow-up endoscopy and deep biopsies continue to be necessary. Careful data from much larger populations with long-term follow-up is required before ablation reaches the stage of broad clinical application.",2,E

Based on their characteristic medical history alone, such patients can usually be presumed to have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In around 30-50% of them, the endoscopic examination will reveal the typical erosions and ulcerations in the esophagus. In addition to the clinical symptoms, endoscopy plays a central role in diagnosing GERD. An endoscopy is always indicated whenever these warnings symptoms are present. In patients with persistent reflux problems, endoscopy is indicated to diagnose erosive reflux esophagitis. This procedure should include a routine biopsy taken distal to the Z-line to enable histological detection of the metaplasia associated with Barrett's esophagus. Although the majority of patients exhibit the classical symptoms and respond to acid suppression therapy, endoscopy may not find erosions (non-erosive reflux disease NERD). In these cases, further diagnostic steps must be taken to verify the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. There are patients, moreover, who exhibit unclear, uncharacteristic reflux symptoms, such as respiratory diseases with bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic cough or ENT problems like posterior laryngitis and globus sensation (a lump in the throat). In these uncertain cases and in patients with NERD, 24-hour pH monitoring can verify and objectify and acid gastroesophageal reflux. An association can then be made between acid reflux and symptomatology. As an alternative, trial therapy with a proton pump inhibitor can help identify patients who have acid-related problems and symptoms. Other functional tests such as radiographic examination, manometry or scintigraphy are less well suited, if at all, for primary diagnostics of gastroesophageal reflux disease.",7,E

In a large well designed 8-week trial in patients (n >5000) with erosive oesophagitis, esomeprazole recipients achieved significantly higher rates of endoscopically confirmed healed oesophagitis than those receiving lansoprazole. Respective healed oesophagitis rates with once-daily esomeprazole 40mg or lansoprazole 30mg were 92.6 and 88.8%. Overall, esomeprazole was also better than omeprazole, although these differences were not always statistically significance. Ninety-two to 94% of esomeprazole recipients (40mg once daily) achieved healed oesophagitis versus 84 to 90% of omeprazole recipients (20mg once daily). Esomeprazole was effective across all baseline grades of oesophagitis; notably, relative to lansoprazole, as baseline severity of disease increased, the difference in rates of healed oesophagitis also increased in favour of esomeprazole. Resolution of heartburn was also significantly better with esomeprazole 40mg than with these racemic proton pump inhibitors. Long-term (up to 12 months) therapy with esomeprazole effectively maintained healing in these patients. Once-daily esomeprazole 20 or 40mg for 4 weeks resolved symptoms in patients with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) without oesophagitis. Symptoms were effectively managed in the long-term with symptom-driven on-demand esomeprazole (20 or 40mg once daily). Eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection is considered pivotal to successfully managing duodenal ulcer disease. Seven days' treatment (twice-daily esomeprazole 20mg plus amoxicillin 1g and clarithromycin 500mg) eradicated H. pylori in >/=86% of patients (intention-to-treat), a rate that was similar to equivalent omeprazole-based regimens. Esomeprazole is generally well tolerated, both as monotherapy and in combination with antimicrobial agents, with a tolerability profile similar to that of other proton pump inhibitors. Few patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-emergent adverse events (<3% of patients), with very few (<1%) drug-related serious adverse events reported.; Esomeprazole is an effective, well tolerated treatment for managing GORD and for eradicating H. pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcer disease. In 8-week double-blind trials, esomeprazole healed oesophagitis and resolved symptoms in patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive oesophagitis and overall, provided better efficacy than omeprazole. Notably, in a large (n >5000 patients) double-blind trial, esomeprazole 40mg provided significantly better efficacy than lansoprazole in terms of healing rates and resolution of symptoms. Long-term therapy with esomeprazole maintained healed oesophagitis in these patients. Esomeprazole also proved beneficial in patients with symptomatic GORD without oesophagitis.

This study was carried out to assess the efficacy and rapidity of once-daily rabeprazole (10 mg or 20 mg) in relieving symptoms in endoscopically negative patients with moderately severe GERD symptoms and to evaluate the safety of these doses over 4 wk.; This placebo-controlled, double blind study enrolled 203 men and women with moderately severe symptoms of GERD. After a 2-wk, single-blind placebo run-in phase, patients were randomized to receive 10 mg or 20 mg of rabeprazole or placebo once daily for 4 wk.; Rabeprazole rapidly and effectively relieved heartburn, with significant improvements on day 1 of dosing. It also improved most other GERD-related symptoms, including regurgitation, belching, bloating, early satiety, and nausea. Both rabeprazole doses were significantly superior to the placebo with respect to time to the first 24-h heartburn-free interval (2.5 and 4.5 days for 10 mg and 20 mg of rabeprazole, respectively, vs 21.5 days for the placebo) and first daytime or nighttime heartburn-free interval (1.5-3 days for rabeprazole groups vs 12.5-15 days for the placebo), as well as to percentage of time patients were heartburn-free and free of antacid use. Both rabeprazole doses were well tolerated.; Based on these findings and prior studies, rabeprazole reliably relieves GI symptoms equally well in both nonerosive GERD and erosive GERD.",E,E

Before the approval, the Japanese guideline of ""Diagnosis and Treatment of H. pylori infection"" was made by the guideline committee of the Japanese Society for Helicobacter Research. Indications for H. pylori eradication therapy were classified into three groups: (A) recommended: gastric and duodenal ulcers; (B) recommended and managed at a specialized institution: low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma; (C) current studies of the significance of the therapy: following endoscopic mucosal resection of early gastric cancer and gastric surgery for gastric cancers, hyperplastic gastric polyp, atrophic gastritis, and nonulcer dyspepsia. The first-line therapy regimen recommended is 1 week of triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor standard dose twice a day, amoxicillin 750 mg bid, and clarithromycin 200 or 400 mg bid. The reasons for preferring this regimen are to avoid extensive use of metronidazole, which is allowed for treatment of Trichomonas infection in Japan, and the low rate of emergence of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori with amoxicillin co-therapy. For second-line therapy patients should be referred to specialists, who can examine the susceptibility of H. pylori isolates against antibiotics and have much experience with this therapy.",7,E

Infection leads to a range of subclinical and clinical outcomes that depend on properties of the infecting strain, the host, and the environment. Eradication therapy is indicated for infected persons who develop peptic ulcer disease or gastric lymphoma or who are beginning long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, treatment may worsen gastroesophageal reflux disease and increase the risk of esophageal cancer. H. pylori infections can be diagnosed noninvasively and can be eradicated with approximately 85% success by a variety of multidrug, 7-14-day regimens. Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is affecting treatment effectiveness in the United States and abroad. A more complete understanding of the variation in H. pylori pathogenesis should lead to clearer recommendations about treatment for infected persons who have neither peptic ulcer disease nor gastric lymphoma.",7,E

Recently, we identified and cloned another component of human colonic mucus, IgG Fc binding protein (Fc gamma BP). Fc gamma BP is immunologically distinct from known Fc gamma receptors and its structure contains repeated cysteine rich unit sequences resembling those present in mucins. In this work, we assessed the tissue distribution of Fc gamma BP, its binding activity in various body fluids, and its ability to inhibit complement mediated haemolysis.; Immunohistochemical localisation of Fc gamma BP, using monoclonal antibodies against Fc gamma BP (K9 or K17) and labelled IgG, was conducted in various mucin producing tissues: colon, small intestine, stomach, gall bladder, cystic duct, choledochus, bronchus, submandibular gland, conjunctiva, and cervix uteri. The binding activity of Fc gamma BP in mucus extracted from colon, gastric juice, bile, nasal discharges, saliva, sputum, and tears was also examined by immunodotblot and immunoprecipitation using these monoclonal antibodies. Inhibition of complement mediated haemolysis by Fc gamma BP was investigated using sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and anti-SRBC IgG.; The immunohistochemical study revealed that mucin secreting cells in the colon, small intestine, gall bladder, cystic duct, choledochus, bronchus, submandibular gland, and cervix uteri contained Fc gamma BP, and immunodotblot and immunoprecipitation analysis using IgG and monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the fluids secreted by these cells were capable of binding IgG. Mucin producing cells of the conjunctiva did not express Fc gamma BP molecules or bind to IgG. The surface mucus cells in the stomach were variably positive for Fc gamma BP. Perhaps because of proteolytic degradation, Fc gamma BP in gut lavage fluid did not have IgG binding activity, although this activity was present in the mucus covering the colon. Fc gamma BP suppressed complement mediated haemolysis of SRBC.; Fc gamma BP is widely expressed on mucosal surfaces and in external secretions. It is functionally intact in several fluids. These findings lend support to the concept that Fc gamma BP is an important component of mucosal immunological defences.",9,E

As fundus relaxing agents may be effective in the treatment of these symptoms, insight into the mediators involved in fundic accommodation and associated perceptual responses is important. Therefore, we studied the effect of nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibition by N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) on fundic tone, postprandial sensations, and gastric perception in healthy volunteers.; Eighteen healthy volunteers participated in a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised study. They underwent a gastric barostat study to evaluate the effect of L-NMMA on meal and distension induced sensations and on fundic relaxation in response to oral meal intake, intraduodenal lipid, and glucagon administration.; Compared with placebo, L-NMMA decreased fundic volume after oral meal intake (438 (55) v 304 (67) ml; n=8; p<0.05) and during intraduodenal lipid infusion (384 (37) v 257 (43) ml; n=10; p<0.05) but not after glucagon injection (570 (62) v 540 (52) ml; n=4; p=0.4). In addition, basal fundic volume was significantly reduced by L-NMMA. Scores for nausea and satiation were decreased by L-NMMA after oral meal intake but not during intraduodenal lipid infusion. Perception scores to gastric distension were not altered by L-NMMA.; NO is involved in maintaining basal fundic tone and in meal induced fundic relaxation in humans, but not in visceral perception.",9,E

Proton pump inhibitors have been shown to increase healing rates and improve clinical symptoms. The objective of this study is to compare gastric ulcer healing rates for patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, or lansoprazole), an histamine 2- receptor antagonist (ranitidine) or placebo.; A literature search was conducted to identify randomized, controlled clinical trials that included a PPI in at least one treatment arm and assessed the gastric ulcer healing rates endoscopically. The healing rates were estimated for each treatment at specific time points, and Rate Ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for each trial.; Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria: four compared a PPI versus placebo, nine compared a PPI versus ranitidine (no trials of rabeprazole versus ranitidine met the inclusion criteria), and three compared a newer PPI (lansoprazole, pantoprazole or rabeprazole) versus omeprazole. In relation to ranitidine, the pooled RR of PPIs (lansoprazole, omeprazole and pantoprazole) was 1.33 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.42) at four weeks. In each trial, greater improvement in the studied clinical symptoms was found with the newer PPIs (rabeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole) when compared to omeprazole.; In this study treatment with PPIs resulted in higher healing rates than ranitidine or placebo. This evidence suggests that the first choice for gastric ulcer treatment for the greater relief of symptoms is one of the newer PPIs.",7,E

The withdrawal of cisapride has created a vacuum in the prokinetic market, with few promising drugs in the pipeline. Reflux inhibitors are being considered for clinical trials, but as of yet are unavailable. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) continue to be the backbone of therapy for acid suppression, providing excellent relief of symptoms and healing of erosive esophagitis. Isomeric technology with esomeprazole as the prototype represents an advance in PPI pharmacology. Antireflux surgery is now more patient-friendly, with shorter hospitalization and less major morbidity compared to open fundoplication, but surgery is at best equal to medical therapy when optimal doses of antisecretory therapy are used. Two endoscopic procedures were recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease: radiofrequency energy delivery to the gastroesophageal junction, and transoral flexible endoscopic suturing. These techniques should be used selectively until we have more data and until results are compared to the safe and highly effective medical therapies.",7,E

Twenty-two patients had respiratory symptoms in addition to the gastrointestinal complaints. PH-recording was normal in 17/67 subjects, slightly pathological in 33 and severe reflux was diagnosed in 13 patients. Histologically, minimal changes associated with GER were diagnosed in 22 and mild esophagitis in 7. Thirty-six patients had been treated with prokinetic drugs. H2-blockers had been used in 24 children and proton-pump inhibitors in 4. After a mean follow-up period of 28 months, only 24% of patients had become symptom-free. Control endoscopy showed no progression of the esophageal inflammation in any of the subjects.; Pathological reflux in children is associated with no or mild esophageal inflammation, which is unlikely to deteriorate. Therefore endoscopic control could be limited to cases with severe esophagitis.",2,E

In order to document dosing patterns, the medication was dispensed in bottles supplied with a Medication Event Monitoring System recording date and time the bottles were opened. There were regular follow-up visits with assessment of symptoms.; Three-hundred patients were eligible for analysis according to 'all patients treated'. A dosing pattern was found of an increased intake mornings and evenings and constant intervals between intakes. Although there was no correlation between oesophagitis grade or initial symptoms and the amount of medication consumed, the patients had significantly fewer reflux symptoms the more medication they consumed. There was no difference in the number of capsules consumed between the lansoprazole (0.73 capsules/day) and omeprazole groups (0.71 capsules/day). Nor was there any difference between the groups in reflux symptoms during the course of the study.; Despite rigorous instructions to take medication on demand, the results suggest that it is patient habits more so than symptoms that determine the frequency and interval of medication intake.

Esomeprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), is the S-isomer of omeprazole. Esomeprazole has FDA-approved labeling for use in the treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), including healing and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and as part of a triple-drug regimen for Helicobocter pylori infection. Esomeprazole is structurally similar to other PPIs but is the first PPI to include only the active isomer, which may lead to improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. Esomeprazole maintains intragastric pH at a higher level and above 4 for a longer period than other PPIs. Clinical studies have shown that esomeprazole is at least equivalent in safety and efficacy to other drugs in the class. Esomeprazole has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of erosive esophagitis, the maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis, and the treatment of signs and symptoms of GERD. Effective dosages are 20 or 40 mg orally every day or as needed. Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin is effective in eradicating H. pylori infection. The potential for interacting with other drugs is limited and is similar to that of omeprazole. The most common adverse effects are headache, respiratory infection, and abdominal symptoms. Esomeprazole has pharmacokinetic properties that may make it more effective than omeprazole in some patients.",7,E

Patients were investigated at baseline (58 H. pylori positive and 17 H. pylori negative) and after treatment with omeprazole with or without additional antibiotic therapy.; Genotyping at baseline was complete in 52 (90%) of the 58 H. pylori positive patients. Multiple genotypes were detected in eight (14%) of these. Genotypes were highly consistent between antrum and corpus biopsy specimens at baseline and in follow-up samples. Genotypes from paraffin sections matched those from corresponding cultured strains in 10 selected cases. In the antrum, the degree of inflammation was associated with vacA s1 and cagA+ genotypes, and the degree of neutrophil activity was associated with the cagA+ genotype. In the corpus, the degree of inflammation was significantly associated with vacA s1, cagA+, and iceA1 genotypes and the degree of atrophy was associated with vacA s1, m1, and cagA+ genotypes, whereas the degree of neutrophil activity was associated with vacA s1 and cagA+ genotypes. vacA s2 and cagA-strains appeared more resistant to antibiotic therapy, irrespective of resistance to clarithromycin.; Our findings confirm the relevance of the H. pylori genotypes for the severity of gastric disease and the efficacy of antibiotic therapy.",4,E

Patients with coagulopathy were excluded from the study. Univariate analysis of the clinical and endoscopic parameters to predict failure in EIT was performed first. A multiple logistic regression was used to develop a scoring system. This scoring equation was further applied to 50 prospective patients with bleeding peptic ulcers to validate its predictive value.; EIT failed to arrest bleeding in 32 (25.6%) patients. Shock, blood transfusion of at least 500 ml, active bleeding, and ulcer size were effective in predicting failure in EIT as calculated by univariate analysis, while multivariate analysis showed shock, active bleeding and ulcer size to be the independent predictors. The scoring equation, defined as -3.14 + 1.29 (shock) + 0.99 (active bleeding) + 0.13 (ulcer size in mm), had a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 76.9% in predicting failure of EIT in the prospective cohort of 50 bleeding patients.; The presence of shock, active bleeding (spurting or oozing hemorrhage) and ulcer size are risk factors of failure of EIT in Taiwanese patients with bleeding peptic ulcers.

Antibiotic susceptibility to metronidazole, amoxicillin, tetracycline and clarithromycin was defined by E-test. Thirty-nine patients received a two-week quadruple culture-guided therapy defined by the protocol, which considered sensitivity data and previous allergies to antibiotics (one culture was contaminated, one patient refused treatment and one was allergic to tetracycline and amoxicillin and was resistant to metronidazole and clarithromycin). Compliance was monitored by pill counting and eradication was defined as a negative urea breath test six weeks after the end of treatment.; Sensitivity data were obtained in 41 patients.

Eighteen strains (43.9%) were resistant to metronidazole, 21 (51.2%) were resistant to clarithromycin and 8 (19.5%) were resistant to both drugs. None of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin or tetracycline. We used mainly two kinds of quadruple therapy in the 39 patients.

Thus, strategies to decrease resource expenditures without impairing patient quality of life are desirable. On-demand therapy (one-dose when symptoms occur) and intermittent therapy (short course of medication when symptoms occur) are attractive since pharmaceutical expenditures may be decreased, and many patients self-employ this strategy. The purpose of this paper was to examine the economic implications of on-demand or intermittent therapy for GORD. A review of selected studies evaluating medication suitable for on-demand or intermittent administration was performed. A complete search for published studies on the cost effectiveness of on-demand or intermittent therapy for GORD was conducted, and the results discussed in detail. Antacids, alginates, topically active agents, histamine(2)-receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors have all demonstrable efficacy compared with placebo when administered on-demand. Proton pump inhibitors constitute the most effective pharmacological means to treat GORD. Although step-up strategies initially using less potent medication may decrease resource use, cost-effectiveness analysis illustrates that on-demand or intermittent therapy with proton pump inhibitors may be reasonable options. Further work that defines quality of life and patient preferences associated with GORD may allow for proper allocation of resources for the management of this condition.",7,E

The question of the development of Barrett's esophagus and the progression to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is addressed by comparison of the data available in the literature. A retrospective review of the literature on the outcome of GERD patients after surgical and medical therapy, is made. Surgical therapy is able to eliminate reflux of gastric and duodenal contents and therefore seems to be superior over medical therapy in the prevention of Barrett's esophagus and its progression to invasive cancer. Surgery should be considered in all Barrett's patients especially in young patients, patients with large hiatal hernia, increasing drug doses or noncompliance to medical therapy.",2,E

Currently, there is no validated instrument that documents symptom severity in LPR. We developed the reflux symptom index (RSI), a self-administered nine-item outcomes instrument for LPR. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the RSI. For validity assessment, 25 patients with LPR were evaluated prospectively before and six months after b.i.d. treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Each patient completed the RSI as well as the 30-item voice handicap index (VHI). For reliability assessment, the study patients were given the RSI on two separate occasions before the initiation of treatment. Normative RSI data were derived from 25 age-matched and gender-matched controls taken from an existing database of asymptomatic individuals without any evidence of LPR. The mean RSI (+/- standard deviation) of patients with LPR improved from 21.2 (+/- 10.7) to 12.8 (+/- 10.0), and the mean VHI improved from 52.2 (+/- 24.7) to 41.5 (+/- 25.0) after 6 months of therapy (p = 0.001 and 0.065, respectively). Of the three VHI subscales (emotional, physical, functional), only the functional subscale improved significantly (p = 0.037). Patients who experienced a five point or better improvement in RSI were 11 times more likely to experience a five-point improvement in VHI (95% confidence interval = 1.7, 76.8). For reliability assessment, the first and second pretreatment RSIs were 19.9 (+/- 11.1) and 20.9 (+/- 9.6), respectively (correlation coefficient = 0.81, p < 0.001). The single-item correlation coefficients ranged from 0.41 to 0.91 (p < 0.05 for all items). The mean pretreatment RSI in patients with LPR was significantly higher than controls (21.2 versus 11.6; p < 0.001). The mean RSI of patients with LPR after 6 months of PPI therapy approached that of asymptomatic controls (p > 0.05). The RSI is easily administered, highly reproducible, and exhibits excellent construct and criterion-based validity.",3,E

A strict correlation between H. pylori infection and gastroduodenal diseases has been demonstrated, including gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Current therapies against H. pylori consist of an antisecretory plus antibiotics. These therapies are effective in 80 - 90% of the cases; presently, no alternative therapies have been shown to give comparable or better results. There are two main reasons for therapy failure: poor compliance, which results in cure discontinuation, and antibiotic resistance. To overcome the drawbacks inherent to any antibiotic therapy, a prophylactic vaccine seems to be the most reasonable approach. Vaccines have been developed based on data obtained in animal models, a number of which are currently in Phase I clinical trials, in some cases giving encouraging data for safety and immunogenicity. In the absence of any immunological correlate of protection against H. pylori, it will be possible to evaluate the efficacy of these vaccines only in large Phase III clinical trials.",7,E

According to some authors, H. pylori infection in humans does not act synergistically with NSAID on ulcer healing, therefore, there is no need to eradicate the germ. This notion is supported by the finding that the eradication of H. pylori does not affect NSAID-induced gastropathy treated with omeprazole and that H. pylori infection induces a strong cyclooxygenase-2 expression resulting in excessive biosynthesis of gastroprotective prostaglandins, which should in turn counteract NSAID-induced gastropathy and heal the existing ulcer. Other investigators claim that H. pylori infection acts synergistically with NSAID on ulcer development, therefore, H. pylori should be eradicated, particularly at the start of long-term NSAID therapy. Maastricht 2-2000 consensus also recommends eradication prior to NSAID treatment, but this eradication does not appear to accelerate ulcer healing or to prevent the recurrent ulcers in NSAID users. Our studies in almost 6,000 dyspeptic patients undergoing upper endoscopy and [(13)C]-urea breath test (UBT) revealed that about 70% of these patients are H. pylori (+) and about 30.6% of these develop gastroduodenal ulcers. Of these ulcers, over 70% were H. pylori (+) positive, 12% NSAID (+), 8% were both H. pylori (+) and NSAID (+), while 22% ulcers were H. pylori (-) and NSAID (-) or ""idiopathic"" ulcers. Basically, our results support Hawkey's concept and this also agrees with our findings in the rat model showing that: (1) there is no synergistic interaction between H. pylori infection and NSAID on gastric ulcer development, (2) H. pylori and NSAID are independent risk factors for peptic ulceration, and (3) NSAID therapy in H. pylori positive patients attenuates the ulcer development possibly due to direct inhibitory action of these drugs on H. pylori.",7,E

However, four thousands a year still died caused by this disease in Japan. Ten to twenty percent of the non-NSAIDs ulcer could be expected to remain after complete eradication of H. pylori; The number could be still 100,000-200,000 a year in Japan. Furthermore, NSAIDs ulcer would not decrease in number in the post-H. pylori era. Recurrence of ulcer is related to the quality of ulcer healing. Deficiency of prostaglandins(PG) in the mucosa is another main reason than H. pylori infection of poor quality of ulcer healing. Therefore, a PG analogue may be a most reasonable tool for treatment of H. pylori-negative PUD including NSAIDs ulcer, but is often poorly tolerated because of diarrhea and abdominal pain. The mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs is also gastric acid-dependent and so, an H2-receptor antagonist is to some extent effective although the efficacy is far behind of that with a PG-analogue. Recently, a proton-pump inhibitor has been reported to exert the same effect as a PG-analogue in healing of gastroduodenal mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs and the superior effect in preventing recurrence of the damage with better tolerance. This results suggest that strong acid inhibition is highly effective for such damage. Whether such strong acid inhibition causes disturbance of absorption of NSAIDs is not clear, which might result in poor antiinflammatory effect. Elderly patients often have tendency of constipation and less possibility of pregnancy. Therefore, a PG-analogue may be not only safe but also more favorable for such patients.",7,E

The second-line treatment is suggested to be PPI-quadruple therapy for a minimum of 7 days. If bismuth compounds are not available, PPI-based triple therapy will have to be used as a second-line treatment only after susceptibility testing.

However, the percentage of H. pylori-positive elderly patients who are tested and treated for their infection remains very low. We now have data that demonstrate the benefit of curing H. pylori infection in elderly patients with H. pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease and severe chronic gastritis. Furthermore, the cure of H. pylori may prevent progression of intestinal metaplasia and gastric atrophy. Studies are needed to clarify the role of eradication for elderly patients who have nonulcer dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease and who use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. H. pylori infection may be easily diagnosed by histological evaluation, rapid urease test or culture performed on gastric biopsies taken during endoscopy. However, the biopsy site must be carefully selected in elderly patients. For noninvasive monitoring of H. pylori infection after treatment, the 13C-urea breath test has significantly higher accuracy than serology in the elderly. The role of the H. pylori stool antigen test in old age still needs to be clarified. One-week PPI-based triple therapy regimens including clarithromycin, amoxycillin and/or nitroimidazoles are highly effective and well tolerated in elderly patients. Low doses of both PPIs and clarithromycin (in combination with standard doses of amoxycillin or nitroimidazoles) are sufficient.

Patients undergoing surveillance for Barrett's oesophagus (n 100), on long-term proton pump inhibitors were randomized into two groups: vitamin C (500 mg twice/d) and vitamin E (100 mg twice/d) for 12 weeks (the supplemented group) or placebo. Those attending for subsequent endoscopy had gastric juice, plasma and mucosal measurements of vitamin levels and markers of DNA damage. Seventy-two patients completed the study. Plasma ascorbic acid, total vitamin C and vitamin E were elevated in the supplemented group consistent with compliance. Gastric juice ascorbic acid and total vitamin C levels were raised significantly in the supplemented group (P=0.01) but supplementation had no effect on the mucosal level of this vitamin. However, gastric juice ascorbic acid and total vitamin C were within normal ranges in the unsupplemented group. Mucosal malondialdehyde, chemiluminescence and DNA damage levels in the comet assay were unaffected by vitamin supplementation. In conclusion, supplementation does not affect DNA damage in this group of patients.

Ulcers with active bleeding or signs of recent bleeding were treated with injection therapy using epinephrine (1/10,000) and 1% polidocanol.; Multivariate analysis revealed that liver cirrhosis, recent surgery, systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, hematemesis, Forrest classification, and ulcer size and site were significantly predictive variables for the recurrence of hemorrhage. Among these, Forrest classification was the most important. The overall accuracy of the predictive model was 71% (95% CI = 63 - 79%). The model showed a better sensitivity of 90% for early rebleeding (< 48 hours) than for late rebleeding (> or = 48 hours) where the sensitivity was 65 %. A prognostic score was obtained and patients were classified into four risk classes: very low (VL), low (L), high (H), and very high (VH).

The diagnosis of GERD in children is made based upon the child's history, and data derived primarily from pH monitoring tests and endoscopy. In those children with confirmed reflux disease, the options for management parallel those recommended in adult patients, with the first step consisting of lifestyle changes. Surgical procedures may also be performed; however, these are rarely recommended prior to an adequate course of pharmacologic therapy, and appropriate case selection is important. Among the current pharmacotherapeutic options available in the US, the prokinetic agents and the acid-inhibitory agents (histamine-2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) are the most widely used. The clinical utility of the prokinetic agents has been limited by the recent withdrawal of cisapride from the US marketplace and the potential for irreversible central nervous system complications with metoclopramide. Numerous clinical studies performed in adults, and several studies involving children, have demonstrated that the proton pump inhibitors are more effective than the histamine-2 receptor antagonists in the relief of GERD symptoms and healing of erosive esophagitis. In children, omeprazole and lansoprazole may be administered as the intact oral capsule, or in those who are unable or unwilling to swallow, the granule contents of the capsule may be mixed with soft foods (e.g. apple sauce) or fruit drinks/liquid dietary supplements prior to oral administration with no detrimental effects on pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, or pharmacodynamics. Studies performed with omeprazole and lansoprazole in children have shown pharmacokinetic parameters that closely resemble those observed in adults. In over a decade of use in adults, the proton pump inhibitor class of agents has been found to have a good safety profile. Studies involving children have also shown these agents to be well tolerated.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most frequent cause of NCCP.; To test the efficacy of a potent acid-suppressing agent as a diagnostic test in the evaluation of NCCP and to compare it with three commonly used tests.; Eighteen men and 24 women, aged 22 to 77 years, who presented with recurrent chest pain complaints of a noncardiac etiology, as determined by rest/stress perfusion imaging with technetium Tc99m sestamibi (MIBI), were enrolled in a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial using high-dose omeprazole. Thirty-seven patients completed both arms of the trial. Findings were compared with those of endoscopy, manometry, and ambulatory 24-hour two-channel esophageal pH monitoring. All patients underwent initial diagnostic upper endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-hour pH monitoring. Patients were then randomly assigned to either placebo or omeprazole (40 mg/d orally twice daily) for 14 days, washed out for 21 days, and then crossed over. Patient's symptoms were determined using a Visual Analogue Scale to measure the severity of chest pain before and after each period.; Seventy-one percent of patients in the omeprazole arm reported improved chest pain, whereas only 18% in the placebo arm did. Abnormal results on manometry (20%), 24-hour pH monitoring (42%), or endoscopy with visual evidence of esophagitis (26%) were found less frequently. Combination of the three tests did not significantly increase their usefulness. In NCCP patients with GERD, as defined by positive results on a 24-hour pH test or presence of esophagitis on endoscopy, omeprazole treatment led to a response in 95% of patients, whereas 90% of GERD-positive patients treated with placebo did not respond. Of NCCP patients determined to be GERD negative, 39% responded to omeprazole.; Omeprazole as a first diagnostic tool in the evaluation of MIBI-negative NCCP is sensitive and specific for determining the cause of NCCP. Endoscopy, manometry, and 24-hour pH monitoring were not only less sensitive in diagnosing NCCP, but they were significantly more expensive.",2,E

Bacterial, host, and environmental factors all have a role in peptic-ulcer disease. Although the prevalence of uncomplicated peptic ulcers is falling, hospital admissions for ulcer complications associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are rising. Evidence suggests that prescription of NSAIDs along with potent antiulcer agents and the use of highly selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors reduce gastroduodenal ulceration. Whether these therapeutic advances will translate into clinical benefits remains to be seen. The interaction between H pylori and NSAIDs is one of the most controversial issues in peptic ulcer disease. With the fall in rates of H pylori infection, the proportion of ulcers not related to this organism and NSAIDs has risen, which will affect the management of peptic ulcer.",7,E

Perhaps the most compelling is the evidence that chronic acid suppression therapy can lead to the development of atrophic gastritis, a premalignant condition, in patients with H pylori infection. Epidemiological data that suggest that H pylori is less prevalent in GERD patients than in control subjects may be susceptible to publication bias, and confounding social and environmental factors may also be involved. Although it has been thought that eradication of the organism might lead to increased esophageal acid exposure, this has not been demonstrated in practice. Studies that appeared to show that GERD could be provoked by antimicrobial therapy of duodenal ulcers also have methodological weaknesses. Underlying GERD symptoms might be unmasked after withdrawal of acid-suppression therapy, for reasons that are unrelated to H pylori. In fact, eradication of the organism has been shown to decrease heartburn in patients with peptic ulcer disease. When H pylori is successfully eradicated in patients with GERD, relapse rates are not increased, and the disease-free interval seems to be prolonged. Eradication of the organism is a wise policy in patients who face long term acid-suppression therapy for GERD.",7,E

The more virulent cagA-positive strains of the organism are also less commonly seen in patients with erosive esophagitis and in those with Barrett's esophagus than in those with less severe forms of GERD. Although the relationship between H pylori and gastric physiology is complex, the organism has little effect on acid secretion in most North American or Western European subjects, and has a net suppressive effect, especially in elderly subjects, in other parts of the world. Thus, the organism has a potential protective effect against GERD, which is exacerbated by gastric acidity. H pylori has no proven effect on other gastric factors that might provoke reflux, including delayed gastric emptying or inappropriate relaxation of the gastric fundus. Two well-designed interventional studies have found that eradication of H pylori either provoked GERD or had no effect. A third smaller study, which seemed to demonstrate that persistent infection was associated with GERD, was flawed, in that the two treatment groups were not comparable. The evidence thus does not support the idea that H pylori infection provokes or aggravates GERD.",7,E

Several of these defects in reasoning are reviewed. For example, it is inappropriate to compare the costs of therapies unless they are equally effective. The relative cost effectiveness of various treatment options is difficult to determine because monetary expenditures and gains in health status cannot easily be measured in commensurate units. Not everything can be translated into incremental cost effectiveness ratios. Two decision analyses from European investigators seemed to show that Nissen fundoplication was more cost effective than long term acid-suppression therapy, but they failed to consider the costs of surgical complications and failures. The most comprehensive decision analysis, employing a Markov chain model, found that the two treatment options were roughly equivalent, at least during the first seven years of follow-up. Decision analyses often do not reflect actual practice patterns and cannot provide solutions to problems that cannot be solved by appropriate medical reasoning. Moreover, results that are reported by specialized surgical centres probably cannot be duplicated by less experienced surgeons. The increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been erroneously attributed to the use of potent acid-suppressant medications, but the actual cause has been shown to be the decreased prevalence of Helicobacter pylori. There are no significant differences in the incidence of this tumour after medical or surgical therapy of GERD. It is unlikely, however, that arguments will convince proponents of one treatment or another to change their opinions.",7,E

Based on the evidence that heartburn cannot be reliably distinguished from other dyspeptic symptoms, the Rome definition appears to be too narrow and restrictive. It is particularly ill suited to the management of uninvestigated dyspepsia at the level of primary care. In patients presenting with uninvestigated dyspepsia, a symptom benefit is associated with a 'test and treat' approach for Helicobacter pylori infection. A substantial proportion of those who do not benefit prove to have esophagitis on endoscopy. In those with functional dyspepsia, the benefits of H pylori eradication, if any, appear to be modest. Hence, a 'symptom and treat' acid-suppression trial with proton pump inhibitors, and a 'test and treat' strategy for H pylori are two acceptable empirical therapies for patients with univestigated dyspepsia.",7,E

By design, approximately half of the patients were naive to bisphosphonates. The primary end point was upper GI tract tolerability based on the incidence of any upper GI tract adverse events. Secondary end points included the number of discontinuations due to drug-related upper GI tract adverse events and the change from baseline in bone resorption, assessed by the urinary N-telopeptide-creatinine ratio at 12 weeks. A subgroup analysis of the primary and secondary end points was performed on the patients stratified by prior bisphosphonate use. The safety and tolerability of the weekly alendronate and placebo regimens were captured as clinical and laboratory adverse events.; A total of 11% of the alendronate patients and 13% of the placebo patients reported an upper GI tract adverse event. Discontinuations due to drug-related upper GI tract adverse events occurred in 3% of alendronate patients and 1% of placebo patients.

To date studies exploring the effect of H. pylori eradication on symptoms have reported conflicting results. Randomised control trials employing validated outcome measures have also been difficult to interpret because of several important issues such as the large placebo response seen in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and both the natural variability in symptoms and symptom severity with time. The association of symptom improvement with resolution of gastritis has meant that the length of follow up employed in most studies has been insufficient. We report the findings of a randomised placebo controlled trial (n = 100), using a validated symptom questionnaire and 5 year follow up to determine the effect of H. pylori eradication on symptoms in nonulcer dyspepsia. In all 64 that were reviewed at 5 years there was a significant difference between patients who were H. pylori negative and those who remained positive with regard to complete symptom resolution, consumption of relevant medications and peptic ulcer disease development, in favour of active treatment. There was a trend for gradual symptom improvement over time irrespective of H. pylori status, which may reflect the natural history of this condition. For those who remained symptomatic at 5 years, there was no difference in symptom severity based on H. pylori status. The findings of this study support the use of H. pylori eradication in symptomatic patients with nonulcer dyspepsia both to induce symptom resolution and to prevent disease progression.",7,E

Clinical symptoms are rather unspecific resulting in a large number of abdominal and extraabdominal diseases that have to be considered regarding the differential diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination, laboratory findings and ultrasound. However it has to be taken into account that a lack of abdominal symptoms and unaltered amylase and lipase levels may be present in spite of overt pancreatitis. As severe pancreatitis is associated with a steep increase in mortality the early identification of severe pancreatitis is crucial. Several prognostic scores like the Ranson-, Glasgow- and APACHE-II score were developed to achieve a higher sensitivity detecting transition to severe pancreatitis. In addition new prognostic serum parameters are applicable. A prophylactic antibiotic therapy is recommended in patients with sterile necrosis whereas an infected necrosis requires organ preserving necrosectomy and retroperitoneal lavage which can be done surgically or referring to new concepts endoscopically. Apart from renal and respiratory failure, necrosis, pseudocysts and pancreatic abscess are the main complications.

While medications can only provide symptom relief, surgery can correct the pathophysiological abnormality of the lower esophageal sphincter. The costs of medical and surgical therapy are much greater than the costs of medication or hospitalization alone. In the case of medical therapy, one must consider the costs of serial monitoring and of failed treatment. The effectiveness of treatment also depends on patient-related factors, including weight, socioeconomic factors, smoking, alcohol use, dietary habits and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgical results depend on the experience and skill of the surgeon, as well as the attributes of the institution in which the procedure is undertaken. Therefore, studies that come from specialized centres may not be applicable to the community. Data from the author's facility indicate that laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is the most cost effective option when it is undertaken by experienced surgeons on otherwise healthy patients who have documented gastroesophageal reflux disease.",7,E

In recent years, the relation between these 2 entities has been investigated and some important conclusions have been reached: in up to half of the cases of GER in infants younger than 1 year, there may be an association with CMA. In a high proportion of cases, GER is not only CMA associated but also CMA induced. The frequency of this association should induce pediatricians to screen for possible concomitant CMA in all infants who have GER and are younger than 1 year. With the exception of some patients with mild typical CMA manifestations (diarrhea, dermatitis, or rhinitis), the symptoms of GER associated with CMA are the same as those observed in primary GER. Immunologic tests and esophageal pH monitoring (with a typical pH pattern characterized by a progressive, slow decrease in esophageal pH between feedings) may be helpful if an association between GER and CMA is suspected, although the clinical response to an elimination diet and challenge is the only clue to the diagnosis. This article reviews the main features of GER and CMA, focusing on the aspects in common and the discrepancies between both conditions.",7,E

This response depends on the pathology treated as well as on the choice of proton pump inhibitor. Here, we identify factors in specific disease therapy and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics that help us achieve this goal. These include differences in PPI bioavailability and acid-suppressive effects. Available data indicate that PPIs appear to have similar potency on a milligram basis, and that omeprazole and lansoprazole are more frequently double dosed than pantoprazole. The lower propensity for double dosing with pantoprazole may also result in lower medication acquisition costs and a reduction in physician visits due to ineffective therapy with the standard dosing of these other agents.",7,E

This study is the second part of a prospective assessment of the quality of life outcome, in a 5-year follow-up of patients who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication or Toupet fundoplication. Data from a 1-year follow-up have been previously published (part I).; Using the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), the quality of life data of 169 consecutive patients who had undergone a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF; n = 104) or a laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication (LTF; n = 65), were evaluated 3 years and 5 years postoperatively. Six patients out of the initial study group (n = 175), including three from each group, were excluded from the main analysis because they had undergone laparoscopic re-fundoplication during the 1-year follow-up. Data from patients with repeat surgery have been analysed separately. In addition to administering the GIQLI, we evaluated patient satisfaction with surgery, possible surgical side effects or recurrent disease-related symptoms, the use of antireflux medication, and also surgical interventions in relation to initial antireflux surgery. In those patients, who were willing (n = 111) we also performed esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring 5 years postoperatively.; At 3 years and 5 years postoperatively, the analysis of quality of life data showed that the GIQLI score remained stable in comparison with the 1-year follow-up data, with mean scores of 121 +/- 8.7 points in the LNF-group and 119.8 +/- 9 points in the LTF-group, at 5 years after surgery. Laparoscopic re-fundoplication was necessary in four patients due to a ""slipping"" Nissen (LNF group n = 1) or recurrent symptoms (LTF group, n = 3). In two patients in the LTF group herniation of a trocar incision was found. No patient suffered from severe surgical side effects. Patient satisfaction with surgery was rated as ""excellent"" or ""good"" in 97.9 % of patients. There were no significant differences between the groups concerning these data. The results of esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring also remained stable and showed normal values in all but two patients (in the LTF group), who suffered from mild and infrequent symptoms of recurrent heartburn without endoscopic signs of esophagitis. The outcome in patients who underwent laparoscopic re-fundoplication is comparable to the outcomes for those with a successful primary intervention.; Both Nissen and Toupet laparoscopic fundoplication can significantly improve patients' quality of life during the 5 years following surgical intervention. Quality of life scores for both surgical groups were almost equal and postoperative outcomes were comparable to values in healthy controls. Patient satisfaction with surgical treatment was very high, even though repeat laparoscopic surgery was necessary in some cases. Patients who had a repeat procedure experienced nearly identical outcomes.",3,E

(OAC, n = 78), or omeprazole (20 mg b.d.), colloidal bismuth subcitrate (120 mg q.i.d.), metronidazole (0.5 g t.i.d.) and tetracycline hydrochloride (0.5 g q.i.d.) (OBMT, n = 71) for 10 days. Patients' symptoms were scored, and compliance and treatment-related side effects were assessed. Endoscopy was performed before treatment and at 10-12 weeks and 12 months after treatment. H. pylori infection and its successful eradication were sought by histology, immunohistochemistry and campylobacter-like organisms (CLO) tests on multiple biopsies taken from the gastric antrum, corpus and fundus. Patients were re-evaluated clinically and underwent a C-urea breath test (UBT) at 21-24 months. Those with dyspepsia and/or recrudescence of H. pylori were re-endoscoped.; Patient groups were comparable for age, sex, smoking, occasional use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and current or past bleeding episodes. Six and seven patients in the OAC and OBMT treatment groups, respectively, were lost to follow-up. Eight patients were non-compliant. Two ulcers in the OAC group and one in the OBMT group did not heal.

References of selected articles were reviewed. A manual search of critical care, surgery, trauma, gastrointestinal, and pharmacy journals was conducted to identify relevant abstracts.; Traditional medications used for stress ulcer prophylaxis include antacids, histamine(2) receptor antagonists (H(2)RAs), and sucralfate. Few studies have evaluated PPIs for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The majority of studies have demonstrated that enteral or intravenous administration of PPIs to critically ill patients elevates intragastric pH and consistently maintains pH > or =4.0. PPIs are safe and seem to be as efficacious as H(2)RAs or sucralfate for prevention of bleeding from stress-related mucosal damage (SRMD) and they may provide cost minimization. The small patient populations limit the results of comparative studies.; Available data indicate that PPIs are safe and efficacious for elevating intragastric pH in critically ill patients. PPIs should be used only as an alternative to H(2)RAs or sucralfate since the superiority of PPIs over these agents for preventing SRMD-associated gastrointestinal bleeding has not been established.

Prolonged intragastric balloon distension might oppose this. The purpose of the study was to investigate the prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux in untreated obese subjects and to study the consequences of weight loss with or without intragastric balloon treatment.; Patients participating in a randomized double-blind, sham-controlled trial received balloon or sham treatment for the first 13 weeks. Thereafter, all subjects received a balloon for the remaining year. Twenty-four-hour pH recordings were made at the start, after 13 weeks of balloon or sham treatment, after 26 and 52 weeks of balloon treatment and 13 weeks after balloon removal.; Group-wise, pH data of 42 untreated patients (BMI 43.4 kg/m2) were highly abnormal. On an individual level, 22 subjects (52%) had some evidence of reflux, 17 patients (40%) showed pathological total reflux times and 8 (19%) had combined total, upright and supine reflux with grade B reflux oesophagitis in only one patient. Albeit poorly, oesophageal acid exposure was related to body weight and visceral fat distribution. A reduction in acid reflux was observed in sham-treated weight-losing subjects, whereas in balloon-treated subjects supine reflux and duration of the longest reflux increased. In the second 13-week period, the initially improved pH values worsened by balloon placement in sham-treated subjects. Values in balloon-balloon-treated subjects stabilized. After 52 weeks, acid reflux levelled off at pretreatment values and further improved after balloon removal. At these times, decreased visceral fat masses correlated significantly with diminished oesophageal exposure to acid.; Obesity predisposed to gastro-oesophageal reflux.

After the treatment period, patients were randomly assigned to receive 20 or 40 mg omeprazole daily for long-term acid suppression. Histological and endoscopic changes were evaluated annually. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to test the following 10 variables as predictors of sustained reversal of Barrett's esophagus at the end of follow-up: age, gender, length of diseased segment, presence of hiatal hernia, circumferential nature of lesion, presence of low-grade dysplasia at initial biopsy, number of coagulation sessions, result of pH monitoring under protein pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment, omeprazole dosage, and initial response to therapy (after 1 month).; The median follow-up period was 36 months (range 12 - 48).

In combination with two antimicrobial agents (most commonly metronidazole, clarithromycin or amoxicillin) for 6-14 days, pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily produced Helicobacter pylori eradication rates of 71-93.8% (intent-to-treat [ITT] or modified ITT analysis) in patients without known antibacterial resistance. Pantoprazole-containing triple therapy was at least as effective as omeprazole- and similar in efficacy to lansoprazole-containing triple therapy in large trials. In the treatment of moderate to severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), oral pantoprazole 40 mg/day was as effective as other PPIs (omeprazole, omeprazole multiple unit pellet system, lansoprazole and esomeprazole) and significantly more effective than histamine H(2)-antagonists. Pantoprazole 20 mg/day provided effective mucosal healing in patients with GORD and mild oesophagitis. Intravenous pantoprazole 40 mg/day can be used in patients who are unable to take oral medication. Oral pantoprazole 20-40 mg/day for up to 24 months prevented relapse in most patients with healed GORD. According to preliminary data, oral pantoprazole 20 or 40 mg/day was effective at healing and preventing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related ulcers, and intravenous pantoprazole was at least as effective as intravenous ranitidine in preventing ulcer rebleeding after endoscopic haemostasis. Oral or intravenous pantoprazole up to 240 mg/day maintained target acid output levels in most patients with hypersecretory conditions, including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Oral and intravenous pantoprazole appear to be well tolerated in patients with acid-related disorders in short- and long-term trials. Tolerability with oral pantoprazole was similar to that with other PPIs or histamine H(2)-antagonists in short-term trials. Formal drug interaction studies have not revealed any clinically significant interactions between pantoprazole and other agents. In conclusion, pantoprazole is an effective agent in the management of acid-related disorders. As a component of triple therapy for H. pylori eradication and as monotherapy for the healing of oesophagitis and maintenance of GORD, pantoprazole has shown similar efficacy to other PPIs and greater efficacy than histamine H(2)-antagonists. Limited data suggest that it is also effective in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and in preventing ulcer rebleeding. Pantoprazole is well tolerated with minimal potential for drug interactions. The availability of pantoprazole as both oral and intravenous formulations provides flexibility when the oral route of administration is not appropriate. Thus, pantoprazole is a valuable alternative to other PPIs in the treatment of acid-related disorders.",5,E

However, in parallel with more effective eradication of H. pylori, the prevalence of H. pylori is changing, and H. pylori-negative peptic ulcer disease appears to be increasing. When making a diagnosis of H. pylori-negative peptic ulcer disease, it is essential to avoid misclassification because of inaccurate diagnosis. In addition, secondary causes may need to be excluded with appropriate investigations. In the absence of H. pylori, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage is the most common cause of peptic ulcer; surreptitious nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage is a cause of unexplained ulcer disease in up to 60% of patients. Hypersecretory syndromes such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, although rare, need to be excluded. Once all known etiological factors are excluded, there remains a group of patients with so-called ""idiopathic ulcers."" The interplay of etiological factors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic peptic ulcer disease is poorly defined but may include a genetic predisposition, altered acid secretion, rapid gastric emptying, defective mucosal defense mechanisms, psychological stress, and smoking. The management of idiopathic peptic ulcers is not defined; they appear to be more resistant to standard therapy, can be associated with more frequent complications, and those that relapse may require long-term maintenance therapy.",7,E

We assessed whether celecoxib would be similar to diclofenac plus omeprazole in reducing the risk of recurrent ulcer bleeding in patients at high risk for bleeding.; We studied patients who used NSAIDs for arthritis and who presented with ulcer bleeding. After their ulcers had healed, we randomly assigned patients who were negative for Helicobacter pylori to receive either 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily plus daily placebo or 75 mg of diclofenac twice daily plus 20 mg of omeprazole daily for six months. The end point was recurrent ulcer bleeding.; In the intention-to-treat analysis, which included 287 patients (144 receiving celecoxib and 143 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole), recurrent ulcer bleeding occurred in 7 patients receiving celecoxib and 9 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole. The probability of recurrent bleeding during the six-month period was 4.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 6.7) for patients who received celecoxib and 6.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.3 to 8.4) for patients who received diclofenac plus omeprazole (difference, -1.5 percentage points; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -6.8 to 3.8).

Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of competing strategies for the posthemostasis management of patients with high risk ulcer stigmata.; Through decision analysis, we calculated the cost-effectiveness of four strategies: 1) follow patients clinically after hemostasis and repeat endoscopy only in patients with evidence of rebleeding (usual care); 2) administer intravenous proton pump inhibitors (i.v. PPIs) after hemostasis and repeat endoscopy only in patients with clinical signs of rebleeding; 3) perform second look endoscopy at 24 h in all patients with successful endoscopic hemostasis; and 4) perform selective second look endoscopy at 24 h only in patients at high risk for rebleeding as identified by the prospectively validated Baylor Bleeding Score. Probability estimates were derived from a systematic review of the medical literature. Cost estimates were based on Medicare reimbursement. Effectiveness was defined as the proportion of patients with rebleeding, surgery, or death prevented.; The selective second look endoscopy strategy was the most effective and least expensive of the four competing strategies, and therefore dominated the analysis. The i.v. PPI strategy required 50% fewer endoscopies than the competing strategies, and became the dominant strategy when the rebleed rate with i.v. PPIs fell below 9% and when the cost of i.v. PPIs fell below 10 dollars/day.; Compared with the usual practice of ""watchful waiting,"" performing selective second look endoscopy in high risk patients may prevent more cases of rebleeding, surgery, or death at a lower overall cost. However, i.v. PPIs are likely to reduce the need for second look endoscopy and may be preferred overall if the rebleed rate and cost of i.v. PPIs remains low.",6,E

Persons who have mutations of both CFTR alleles (one severely and one mildly affected) are especially susceptible to this disease. Because these compound heterozygotes have sufficient residual CFTR function, they do not develop cystic fibrosis lung disease. One PSTI mutation, N34S, independently increases the risk of pancreatitis. Thus, the risk of pancreatitis is greatest among individuals who are CFTR compound heterozygotes and who also have the PSTI mutation. Nonetheless, most people with CFTR and PSTI mutations do not develop pancreatitis. This fact indicates that environmental influences and gene-gene interactions also affect pancreatitis risk. Although CFTR and PSTI genetic testing can identify persons at an increased risk of pancreatitis, there are several reasons why the routine screening of individuals with nonhereditary pancreatitis is not recommended at this time: most disease-associated mutations are not detected by readily available techniques, genetic counselling guidelines do not exist, most patients with mutations do not develop pancreatitis and the results of testing do not affect the clinical management of pancreatitis.",E,E

The key feature of GERD is reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. Medical treatment with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) is well established and is considered the standard treatment. Given the high prevalence of the condition and the excellent response to medical therapy, antireflux surgery is an option for patients with volume reflux that is not properly controlled by medical therapy. Adenocarcinoma is a rare but life-threatening complication of GERD. The only known precursor lesion for esophageal adenocarcinoma is Barrett's esophagus. In recent years, a clearer understanding of the development of Barrett's and of its progression toward invasive cancer has developed. Genetic factors almost certainly determine the individual risk. The length of the Barrett's esophagus segment and the size of a hiatal hernia are associated with the risk of developing high-grade dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma.With regard to the clinical management of GERD patients with Barrett's, endoscopic surveillance at 3-year intervals is now considered appropriate in the absence of dysplasia. In patients with high-grade dyspepsia, the situation is more difficult. While a considerable proportion of these patients may already have invasive cancers, there is also the possibility that there is only focal dysplasia. For this reason, it is justifiable to carry out curative endoscopic resection. Mucosal ablation procedures may also be appropriate, but these still need to be properly investigated in clinical trials.",E,E

Use of PPI medications, pH-metry, manometry, GERD symptoms, and patient quality of life were assessed over a 6-month follow-up period.; At 6 months, PPI use was eliminated in 74% and reduced by > 50% in 10% of patients. The median HRQL score improved from 24.0 pre-implant (baseline off PPIs) to 4.0 at 6 months (p < 0.001). Mean total esophageal acid exposure time was 9.5% pretherapy and 6.7% at 6 months (p < 0.001). Mean LES length increased from 2.0 cm at baseline to 3.0 cm posttherapy (p = 0.003). There were no clinically serious adverse events. Transient mild-to-moderate chest pain commonly occurred after implantation.; The endoscopic implantation of Enteryx is a safe and effective therapy for eliminating or decreasing the need for PPI medications, improving GERD symptoms and patient quality of life, and decreasing esophageal acid exposure among patients suffering from GERD.",3,E

Some clinical studies suggest that surgery could be more effective than medical treatment in preventing BE from progressing to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. However, data from prospective comparative studies are necessary to answer this question.; One hundred one patients were included in a randomized prospective study, 43 with medical treatment and 58 with antireflux surgery. All patients underwent clinical, endoscopic, and histologic assessment. Functional studies were performed in all the operated patients and in a subgroup of patients receiving medical treatment. The median follow-up was 5 years (range 1-18) in the medical treatment group and 6 years (range 1-18) in the surgical treatment group.; Satisfactory clinical results (excellent to good) were achieved in 39 of the 43 patients (91%) undergoing medical treatment and in 53 of the 58 patients (91%) following antireflux surgery. The persistence of added inflammatory lesions was significantly higher in the medical treatment group. The metaplastic segment did not disappear in any case. Postoperative functional studies showed a significant decrease in the median percentage of total time with pH below 4, although 9 of the 58 patients (15%) showed pathologic rates of acid reflux. High-grade dysplasia appeared in 2 of the 43 patients (5%) in the medical treatment group and in 2 of the 58 patients (3%) in the surgical treatment group. In the latter, both patients presented with clinical and pH-metric recurrence. There was no case of malignancy after successful antireflux surgery.; These results show that there are no differences between the two types of treatment with respect to preventing BE from progressing to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. However, successful antireflux surgery proved to be more efficient than medical treatment in this sense, perhaps because it completely controls acid and biliopancreatic reflux to the esophagus.",4,E

Chronic GERD can lead to the development of complications including erosive esophagitis, stricture formation, and Barrett's esophagus, which increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. A trial with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is the quickest and most cost-effective way to diagnose GERD, and is at least as sensitive as 24-hour intra-esophageal pH monitoring. As PPIs only bind to actively secreting proton pumps, they should be dosed 30 to 60 minutes before a meal. Despite these recommendations, a recent survey of over 1000 US primary care physicians found that 36% instructed their patients to take a PPI with or after a meal or did not specify the timing of dosing. The patients who will have the best response to surgical therapy for GERD are those who had clearly documented acid reflux with typical symptoms, and who have responded to PPI treatment. Unfortunately, the same survey found that most physicians recommend antireflux surgery for patients in whom medical therapy has failed.",5,E

It demonstrates pharmacological and clinical benefits beyond those seen with the racemic omeprazole. Esomeprazole has higher and more consistent bio-availability than omeprazole, which results in a greater area under the plasma concentration-time curve. It is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of omeprazole and esomeprazole that determines how much of each reaches the parietal cell, and thus the control of gastric acid secretion that is achieved. Esomeprazole, like other proton pump inhibitors, has a high specificity for the acidic environment of the parietal cell, where it is accumulated, activated and covalently inhibits the proton pump. Proton pumps elsewhere in the body do not achieve the level of acidity needed for accumulation and activation. Esomeprazole, 40 mg once daily, provides more effective control of gastric acid secretion than omeprazole, 20 or 40 mg once daily, and all other proton pump inhibitors given at their standard doses. This translates into greater clinical effect compared with omeprazole, 20 mg once daily, and lansoprazole, 30 mg once daily, in the management of reflux disease. Esomeprazole therapy is well tolerated, with a low adverse events profile, similar to that seen with omeprazole.",E,E

These patients were treated for 14 days with either a dual therapy regime consisting of amoxicillin at 1,500 mg per day and omeprazole at 20 mg per day or a triple therapy regime consisting of the same medications as above plus metronidazole at 1,000 mg per day. Of these 37 patients, 24 patients (64.9%) had successful eradication of the H. pylori infection. The other 13 patients (35.5%) remained infected. Infection by H. pylori was confirmed prior to treatment using conventional microbiological (rapid urease test) and histological tests on biopsy specimens obtained by endoscopy. Four commercially available ELIZA kits (GAP-IgG, Hel-P, Helico-G and HM-CAP) were used to measure the serum levels of IgG antibody against H. pylori before treatment and at 3, 6 and 9 months after treatment. A significant decrease in the IgG titer was observed with the successful eradication of the H. pylori infection.; In patients whom the H. pylori infection was not eradicated, the IgG titer remained the same throughout the testing period. All the kits showed a significant decrease in the IgG levels (approximately 50% at 3 months) with patients that were successfully treated. The HM-CAP kit had the lowest sensitivity at detection the decrease in antibody levels (approximately 42% decrease at 3 months). The GAP-IgG kit was able to detect whether or not H. pylori was eradicated in shortest time period (100% uniformity ratio at 3 months).; The results of this study suggest that monitoring serum IgG levels after treatment may provide an early indicator of the efficacy of therapy in eradicating H. pylori infection. Additionally, the serum IgG level can provide evidence of infection in chronic gastritis patients even when the biopsy specimens are negative by microbiological and/or histological tests.",2,E

Lafutidine is a novel potent H2 receptor antagonist with gastroprotective activities such as enhancement of gastric mucosal blood flow.; 122 outpatients with positive cultures and subsequent successful cultivation of H. pylori for antimicrobial susceptibility tests were randomized to receive a 7-day course of either lafutidine (20 mg twice daily) or lansoprazole (30 mg twice daily), plus clarithromycin (200 mg twice daily) and amoxicillin (750 mg twice daily). Eradication was considered successful if the rapid urease test, culture, histology and [13]C-urea breath test were all negative at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. Cytochrome p450 2C19 genotype status using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was also studied.; On intention-to-treat basis, H. pylori cure was achieved in 52 of 61 (85.2%) patients and 49 of 61 (80.3%) patients for the lafutidine- and lansoprazole-based therapies, respectively. The predicted 95% confidential intervals for the 4.9% of the difference were -1.8-11.6%. Using per protocol analysis, the eradication rates were 88.2% (52/59) and 84.5% (49/58), respectively. The predicted 95% confidential intervals for the 3.7% of the difference were -2.6-10.0%. Adverse events were observed in five and six patients, from the lafutidine and lansoprazole groups, respectively, but they were generally mild. Genetic predisposition of cytochrome p450 2C19 had no significant influence on treatment outcome in both regimens.; The lafutidine-clarithromycin-amoxicillin therapy yielded satisfactory results for eradicating H. pylori, which was comparable with those of the lansoprazole-based regimen with the same drug combination.",E,E

All patients completed a subjective symptom scale (rating laryngeal symptoms and esophageal symptoms) and scoring of flexible fiberoptic examination before treatment and at 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Nonresponders (<50% reduction in symptom score) were recommended to undergo 24-hour dual-probe pH study while on a regimen of 40 mg esomeprazole once a day, to evaluate for the adequacy of acid suppression.; Thirty patients completed the course of therapy. After 4 weeks of treatment, only 8 of 30 patients had significant improvement of their overall symptoms (8 of 30 improved on laryngeal score, and 11 of 18 improved on esophageal score). At 8 weeks of treatment, 19 of 30 patients had significant improvement on their overall symptoms (18 of 30 on laryngeal score, and 13 of 18 on their esophageal score). Five of seven nonresponders who agreed to be tested had positive findings on pH studies (on medication regimen) at 1 cm above the upper esophageal sphincter. Four of 10 nonresponders improved further after increasing their dosage to 40 mg twice a day. Laryngeal examination scores were statistically improved in responders after 8 weeks of treatment.; Laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms require at least 8 weeks of treatment for significant improvement in the majority of patients. Esophageal symptoms improve sooner. Nonresponders at a daily dose of 40 mg should be treated with a dosage of 40 mg twice daily, and pH study on medication reserved for nonresponders at this higher dose.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are extremely effective but expensive, and do not restore the normal antireflux barrier at the gastro-oesophageal junction. Antireflux surgery, even with the laparoscopic approach, has not proven more cost-effective than maintenance therapy with PPIs. Postoperative morbidity is substantial, especially when procedures are done outside expert centres. In the past few years several endoscopic techniques have been developed to treat chronic GORD on an outpatient basis. These techniques include radiofrequency-energy delivery and endoscopic suturing, although other approaches are now under development. STARING POINT: Two prospective open-label studies have recently reported 1-year follow-up of GORD patients treated either by radiofrequency-energy delivery (G Triadafilopoulos and colleagues Gastrointest Endosc 2002; 55:149-56) or endoscopic suturing (Z Mahmood and colleagues Gut 2003; 52:34-39). In a US multicentre trial, Triadafilopoulos and colleagues delivered radiofrequency energy to the cardia and distal oesophagus in patients with chronic heartburn, regurgitation or both (the Stretta procedure). All patients were on continuous acid-suppression therapy, but none had severe oesophagitis or hiatus hernia of more than 2 cm. At 12 months, 94 patients available for follow-up showed significant improvement in GORD symptoms, quality of life, and oesophageal acid-exposure. The need for PPI therapy fell from 98% to 30% of patients. In the Mahmood study, 26 similar patients had endoscopic suturing in a single centre. After 1 year, symptoms and quality of life improved and the need for PPIs was reduced to 36% from 100%. In both studies, only minor complications occurred, none of which required specific therapeutic intervention. WHERE NEXT? An effective outpatient procedure to treat chronic GORD would represent a major step forward. However, further studies are needed before an endoscopic approach can be adopted, as none of the published trials are well-controlled studies. Longer follow-up is needed to ensure that relapses do not occur rapidly, complications do not occur more frequently with less skilled operators, or that endoscopic-induced changes do not complicate or compromise subsequent antireflux surgery. Comparative studies of the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic therapy should also include medical strategies such as intermittent or on-demand PPI therapy.",E,E

Genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 can lead to significant phenotypic variation in the activity of this isoenzyme and thus in the metabolism of PPIs. We systematically reviewed the pharmacogenetic studies of PPIs with respect to the effects of CYP2C19 polymorphism on the clinical outcomes of PPI therapy. We searched MEDLINE (January 1966-August 2002) and EMBASE (January 1988-August 2002) for English-language articles on the pharmacogenetics of PPIs; the search was supplemented by a bibliographic review of all relevant articles. Seventeen pertinent citations were identified, and the quality (level) of evidence for each was categorized according to the rating scale of the United States Preventive Services Task Force. We found that the relationship between CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism and clinical outcomes after PPI therapy has not yet been clearly delineated. Virtually all pharmacogenetic studies of PPIs have been performed in Japanese men; thus, the clinical relevance of CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism in non-Asian patients and women is unknown. Differences among dual- and triple-therapy drug regimens make it difficult to compare H. pylori eradication studies and assess their applicability to current practice patterns. Drug adherence, a pivotal factor in the success of eradication therapy, was addressed in only four trials. Future directions for research include performing more studies with larger sample sizes, particularly in non-Asian populations and women; measuring plasma PPI concentrations to directly correlate H. pylori infection and ulcer cure rates with plasma drug availability; expanding the study population to patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease; and exploring the influence of CYP3A4 in the success or failure of PPI therapy. Although CYP2C19 genotyping is currently only a research instrument, it may be a valuable clinical tool in select patients to ensure optimal PPI therapy.",I,6

Prevention of stress-related bleeding is desirable; however, the optimal use of drugs to prevent gastric bleeding is unclear. Prophylaxis is recommended for surgical patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation or have a coaguloathy. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists and sucralfate will reduce the likelihood of clinically important gastric-bleeding. Sucralfate appears to be less effective than H-2 blockers, but it is associated with fewer side effects such as nosocomial pneumonia. Preliminary studies show that proton pump inhibitors are most effective, have few side effects, but are most expensive. Intravenous proton pump inhibitors may be the drugs of choice for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in high-risk patients.",E,E

All patients completed the questionnaire and underwent gastroscopy. If no abnormalities were found, the patients were prescribed 2 weeks of treatment with omeprazole (20 mg daily). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the overall discriminative value of the questionnaire. Diagnostic test characteristics of both the cut-off score (total diagnostic score) in the questionnaire and the physician's provisional classification were measured using oesophagitis and omeprazole treatment success as the reference tests.; Of the 536 patients included, 515 underwent endoscopy. No abnormalities were found in 286 (55%). Omeprazole treatment success occurred more frequently in patients with a total diagnostic score of > 7 and oesophagitis II-IV in patients with a total diagnostic score of > 9. The diagnostic test characteristics of the questionnaire were comparable with those of the physician's provisional classification. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve did not exceed 0.65. Kappa values for observer agreement with the gold standard were far below 0.4.; The diagnostic performance of this version of the Carlsson-Dent questionnaire was poor.

The most clinically relevant side effects of this toxicity are ulcer complications, including perforation, obstruction, or bleeding. Selective cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors (coxibs) have been proposed as a safer alternative to traditional, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and they are currently widely used in clinical practice. The aim of this review was to analyze the available evidence and then critically evaluate the outcome trials supporting the use of coxibs in terms of their clinical gastrointestinal benefits and global safety.; All published clinical trials on selective COX-2 inhibitors were identified by searching Medline, the World Wide Web (WWW), and abstracts in Congress proceedings. From these, we selected randomized trials that clinically evaluated relevant safety outcome measures. Papers only describing endoscopic evaluation were excluded.; Our search yielded three outcome trials and two pooled safety analyses. The outcome studies supporting the gastrointestinal and global safety of coxibs were found to be biased in their design, analysis, and dissemination, and interpretation of a clinical benefit. Cost considerations would make the use of coxibs acceptable only in patients at high gastrointestinal risk.; The association of the reduced gastroerosive potential of coxibs with improved meaningful outcomes is debatable. Bias in the design of the trials, selection of outcome measures, post-hoc changes in analysis and the variables used, as well as flaws in the publication and reporting of trial results cast serious doubts on the gastrointestinal and global safety profile of coxibs. In addition, their high cost and the lack of clear identification of patients that would benefit most from treatment means the effectiveness of these drugs is uncertain at the moment.",E,E

There are few data on the influence of H. pylori on the rebleeding rate in the acute phase of bleeding however. We therefore prospectively investigated the influence of H. pylori infection on the early rebleeding rate in patients who had undergone successful endoscopic hemostasis treatment for peptic ulcer bleeding.; Between January 1996 and November 2000 all patients with peptic ulcer bleeding were evaluated consecutively. The diagnosis of H. pylori infection was made at index endoscopy, using histology and the rapid urease test. Bleeding activity was assessed using the Forrest classification. After successful endoscopic hemostasis all patients received omeprazole 40 mg or pantoprazole 40 mg, intravenously, twice a day for 3 days. Rebleeding episodes were recorded over 21 days following primary hemostasis.; 344 patients were enrolled into the study. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 62.9 %. A total of 51 patients showed rebleeding (14.8 %), of whom 31 were H. pylori-positive (60 %). There was no statistically significant difference between the H. pylori-positive and -negative patients, however. The rebleeding rate did not differ between patients with H. pylori infection alone and patients also using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. When stratifying patients according to activity of bleeding at index endoscopy, we were also unable to find any significant influence of H. pylori infection on the outcome of Forrest class I and IIa bleedings.; Based on our data, it can be concluded that H. pylori infection does not affect the early rebleeding rate in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding after successful endoscopic hemostasis.",E,E

Patients were identified for inclusion during three 2-week periods in 2000. Medical record reviews were conducted to gather data regarding the costs associated with the administration of SUP drugs and the treatment of any adverse events or therapeutic failures. Decision analysis was used to determine the average cost per patient for each treatment arm. A cost-effectiveness analysis was then conducted to determine which of the SUP agents was associated with the least cost without adversely affecting patient outcomes. A sensitivity analysis was applied to determine the robustness of the data.; Eighty-eight patients were included in the analysis. Five of the patients started on cimetidine experienced therapeutic failure, whereas no patients receiving lansoprazole experienced therapeutic failure. For these reasons, and because lansoprazole is an oral agent, the average costs associated with lansoprazole use were lower than with the use of cimetidine. Lansoprazole was found to be the most cost-effective therapy.; This study showed that lansoprazole is a cost-effective agent for the use of SUP at our institution. However, due to the higher cost of intravenous pantoprazole, the model demonstrates that, assuming equal effectiveness, intravenous pantoprazole would not be cost-effective when compared with cimetidine.",E,E

All patients underwent esophageal motility testing and endoscopy that documented GERD preoperatively, either by a positive 24-hour pH study or biopsy-proven esophagitis. Patients were offered the Stretta procedure if they had documented GERD and did not have a hiatal hernia larger than 2 cm, LES pressure less than 8 mmHg, or Barrett's esophagus. Patients with larger hiatal hernias, LES pressure less than 8 mmHg, or Barrett's were offered LF. All patients were studied pre- and postoperatively with validated GERD-specific quality-of-life questionnaires (QOLRAD) and short-form health surveys (SF-12). Current medication use and satisfaction with the procedure was also obtained.; Results are reported as mean +/- SEM. Seventy-five patients (age 49 +/- 14 years, 44% male, 56% female) underwent LF and 65 patients (age 46 +/- 12 years, 42%, 58% female) underwent the Stretta procedure. Preoperative esophageal acid exposure time was higher in the LF group. Preoperative LES pressure was higher in the Stretta group. In the LF group, 41% had large hiatal hernias (>2 cm), 8 patients required Collis gastroplasty, 6 had Barrett's esophagus, and 10 had undergone previous fundoplication. At 6 months, the QOLRAD and SF-12 scores were significantly improved within both groups. There was an equal magnitude of improvement between pre- and postoperative QOLRAD and SF-12 scores between Stretta and LF patients.

Twenty-two Stretta patients returned for 24-hour pH testing at a mean of 7.2 +/- 0.5 months, and there was a significant reduction in esophageal acid exposure time. Both groups were highly satisfied with their procedure.; The addition of a less invasive, endoscopic treatment for GERD to the surgical algorithm has allowed the authors to stratify the management of GERD patients to treatment with either Stretta or LF according to size of hiatal hernia, LES pressure, Barrett's esophagus, and significant pulmonary symptoms. Patients undergoing Stretta are highly satisfied and have improved GERD symptoms and quality of life comparable to LF. The Stretta procedure is an effective alternative to LF in well-selected patients.",3,E

Lansoprazole fast disintegrating tablet (LFDT)--a new, patient-friendly and more convenient formulation of lansoprazole which can be taken with or without water--is the first PPI to be made available as an orally disintegrating tablet. It represents an innovative drug delivery system, comprising enteric-coated microgranules of lansoprazole compressed with an inactive, rapidly dispersing matrix to form a tablet. When the tablet is placed on the tongue and sucked gently it disintegrates rapidly in the mouth, releasing the enteric-coated microgranules which are swallowed with the patient's saliva without water. Alternatively, the tablet can be swallowed with a drink of water.

They received a once-daily dose of either 40 mg pantoprazole or 40 mg omeprazole MUPS. Healing was determined by endoscopy after 4 weeks of treatment. If patients were not healed, treatment was extended for another 4 weeks. An additional endoscopy was performed in these cases after 8 weeks of treatment. Healing was determined by endoscopy after 4 and 8 weeks. In addition, treatment effect on symptoms was evaluated by the investigator using a questionnaire assessing heartburn, reflux regurgitation and pain on swallowing at each visit, as well as by a self-administered questionnaire comprising further 24 gastrointestinal symptoms. Analyses were performed for the intention-to-treat (ITT) and the per-protocol (PP) population. In addition, patients with high compliance (HC: 90% </=110%) were considered in a separate group. Adverse events and the influence of the Helicobacter pylori status were investigated.; A total of 669 outpatients were enrolled in the study, with 337 patients receiving pantoprazole and 332 omeprazole MUPS. The PP population consisted of 552 patients, 282 treated with pantoprazole and 270 with omeprazole MUPS. The healing rates in both treatment groups were shown to be equivalent and were higher in patients who adhered closely to the administration protocol (HC). According to ITT (ITT(HC)) analyses, healing rates were 65.3% (77.4%) in the pantoprazole and 66.3% (74.7%) in the omeprazole group after 4 weeks. Furthermore, patients infected with H. pylori had slightly but not significantly higher healing rates than those with a negative test result. The safety profile of both treatments was comparable.; Pantoprazole 40 mg and omeprazole MUPS 40 mg were equivalent with respect to healing after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment in patients with reflux esophagitis grade II/III. Overall, HC patients had higher healing rates than the regular compliant patients. Both drugs were well tolerated and safe.",E,E

Patients were interviewed to assess medication compliance and symptom control and to provide education on lifestyle modifications. Interventions with the providers were completed to encourage step-down therapy in appropriate patients.; Two hundred forty-eight patients with active prescriptions for twice-daily lansoprazole were reviewed. Of these patients, 66% (n = 163) did not have an indication compliant with the medical center's guidelines for use of lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily. Of these, 88% (n = 143) had no documented attempt at step-down therapy and 49% (n = 80) had no documented gastrointestinal workup. Interventions for step-down therapy were recommended for 48% (n = 120) of the 248 patients. Forty-six percent (n = 60) of recommendations were accepted, resulting in a cost savings of dollars 85000 per year.; A high rate of clinician noncompliance with the guidelines for appropriate use of lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily was found. These prescribing patterns resulted in significant cost concerns. Our review and interventions led to step-down therapy for almost half of the patients receiving twice-daily lansoprazole.

From 1993 to 2000, expenditures for omeprazole (90% of total market share of PPIs) increased in The Netherlands from 68 million euros to 230 million euros. In 1999, expenditures for pantoprazole accounted for the majority of the rest of the market share for PPIs.; The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and costs of treatment with pantoprazole and omeprazole in The Netherlands.; First, we reviewed clinical studies that compared the efficacy of different dosages of omeprazole and pantoprazole. Second, we analyzed data from a nationwide database of drug prescriptions to determine the dosages used in daily practice in 1999. The data were based on a representative sample of approximately 40% of the Dutch community pharmacies. Third, we modeled the outcome of potential substitution of pantoprazole for omeprazole and the corresponding scenarios for nationwide cost savings using the prescription information from the nationwide database. Potential savings within the Dutch health care system were estimated.; The 1999 prescription data indicated that pantoprazole treatment cost a mean 1.59 euros/d, compared with 2.12 euros/d for omeprazole (1.00 euro = 1.0487 US dollars). The mean cost per defined daily dose of omeprazole was 1.65 euros, compared with 1.59 euros for pantoprazole. Following the summary of product characteristics, treatment with pantoprazole appeared to be less costly for all indications. The projected annual cost savings for substituting pantoprazole for omeprazole on 90% of treatment days were estimated at 40.8 million euros. However, these projected savings may be offset by the costs of switching and the costs of upward dose adjustments that some patients may require.; Based on the available documentation about effectiveness and costs of omeprazole and pantoprazole, pantoprazole may provide a more favorable pharmacoeconomic profile than omeprazole. However, this is only true if the substitution of omeprazole by pantoprazole can be achieved without loss of efficacy or tolerability.",E,E

However, the incidence and severity of GERD in patients with globus sensation without reflux symptoms are unknown. In order to establish the relationship between globus sensation in the jugular fossa and GERD, 20 patients attending our ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinic with globus sensation were investigated with 24-h pH monitoring. A four-channel pH catheter was used with the pH electrodes spaced 5 cm apart in order to detect reflux along the whole length of the esophagus. Fifteen patients complained about globus sensation only; five patients complained additionally about classical reflux symptoms. Thirteen patients showed pathologic reflux measurements. Most of the patients had reflux limited to the distal one-third of the esophagus. Patients with pathologic pH measurements were treated with proton pump inhibitors. Ten out of 13 patients improved with treatment. This study suggests that globus may be associated with reflux, and acidity does not have to reach the pharynx to produce globus sensation.",E,E

Triple therapy (PAC, PCM, PAM) was administered twice daily for 7 days, followed by pantoprazole until the ulcer had healed. Antrum and corpus biopsies were taken to determine the pattern of gastritis, to assess the H. pylori status and to determine the strain susceptibility to antibiotics, and from the ulcer margins and base to exclude malignancy. Scores based on the Sydney system were used to categorize the gastritis phenotypically.; The H. pylori eradication rates for the per protocol (intention-to-treat) analysis were 89% (67%) for PAC, 83% (68%) for PCM and 76% (60%) for PAM, with a significant difference between PAC and PAM. Healing rates after 4 weeks were 91% for PAM, 90% for PCM and 88% for PAC (per protocol analysis). The eradication rates were lower in patients in whom strains resistant to any antibiotic used in the triple therapies were detected. Successful eradication [odds ratio, 5.2 (3.3; 8.3)] and the ulcer size (< 15 mm) were significant predictors for healing after 4 weeks. The regimens showed a comparable safety profile and compliance.; Pantoprazole-based triple therapies are effective in the eradication of H. pylori infection in gastric ulcer patients, as reported in previous similar sized studies in duodenal ulcer patients. Successful eradication and an ulcer size of < 15 mm are the best predictors of gastric ulcer healing after 4 weeks.",6,E

The mean prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with perforated peptic ulcer is of only about 65-70%, which contrasts with the almost 90-100% figure reported in noncomplicated ulcer disease. However, H. pylori infection rates in various studies range markedly from 0% to 100%, suggesting that differences in variables as number and type of diagnostic methods used to diagnose H. pylori infection, or frequency of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug intake, may be responsible for the low prevalence reported in some studies. Recurrent ulcer disease after peptic ulcer perforation mainly occurs in patients with H. pylori infection, which suggests that the microorganism plays an important role in this complication. All patients with perforated peptic ulcer should be treated by simple closure of the perforation and with therapy aimed at healing of the ulcer and eradicating the H. pylori infection, as disappearance of the organism prevents, or at least decreases, ulcer recurrence and ulcer perforation in patients with H. pylori-associated perforated ulcers after simple closure. Therefore, H. pylori eradicating treatment should be started during the immediate postoperative period. The patients with intractable recurrent symptoms of peptic ulcer despite adequate medical treatment, but without H. pylori infection (e.g. a patient using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), is probably the only remaining indication for elective definitive surgical treatment of peptic ulcer disease.",E,E

The analysis demonstrated that the GSFQ questionnaire had excellent psychometric properties shown by the high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha 0.84); that the test-retest reliability was satisfactory (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.64); that there was good evidence that the GSFQ indeed measured what it was intended to measure (validity); and that the GSFQ was highly responsive to change (Guyatt's statistic 1.48).; The GSFQ is a short, self-administered, easy to use, GERD-specific questionnaire which should be considered as a useful assessment tool in the evaluation of patients with GERD and in the assessment of treatment outcomes.",E,E

Traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both isoenzymes, resulting in damage to the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum, but also in cardioprotection. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are less likely to damage the upper gastrointestinal tract, as has been shown by large, randomized, controlled trials. Specifically, the newer agents are superior to ibuprofen and naproxen in this regard, but celecoxib and diclofenac were not significantly different in patients who were not also taking low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. These studies did not include a placebo arm, however, and controlled comparisons of COX-2 inhibitors with placebo have not enlisted enough subjects to demonstrate conclusively that they are equally safe. Selectivity for the COX-2 isoform affords protection against upper gastrointestinal toxicity possibly at the expense of the cardioprotective effect of traditional NSAIDs. This might explain the higher rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients who are given rofecoxib compared with naproxen. A traditional NSAID, combined with either misoprostol or a proton pump inhibitor, is still a suitable alternative to selective COX-2 inhibitors for the treatment of arthritis.",E,E

This article reviews the current state of the art in use of these agents. Lifestyle changes, though sound in their intent and in many cases based on solid laboratory research, can today be considered only adjuncts to pharmacologic therapy. The mainstay of pharmacologic therapy in 2003 is antisecretory therapy. Both H2RAs and PPIs inhibit acid secretion and raise intragastric pH. H2RAs only block one receptor, have limited effect on acid reduction, and are relatively weak inhibitors of meal-stimulated acid secretion. PPIs provide superior control of intragastric pH over a 24-hour period compared with H2RAs and effect greater symptom relief and healing.",5,E

12786613,Review article: management of mild and severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.,Clinical Trials as Topic; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Heartburn; Histamine H2 Antagonists; Humans; Proton Pump Inhibitors,"Tytgat, G N J","Treatment of endosocopy-negative gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (s-GERD) should be directed towards rapid relief of symptoms and then maintenance of relief using minimum yet effective therapy. Responses to proton pump inhibitors are somewhat lower in s-GERD patients compared to GERD with overt erosive damage (e-GERD). The reasons for a lower response rate are not clear but may relate to the inclusion of patients who do not have reflux disease or patients with a lower oesophageal sensory threshold. Also poorly understood is the lower yield of complete heartburn relief when the number of associated dyspeptic symptoms is high. Some form of long-term therapy is needed in the majority of patients. 'On demand' proton pump inhibitor therapy to control reflux symptoms is a new and attractive option. Time to study discontinuation due to insufficient control of heartburn, or any other reason resulting in unwillingness to continue with on-demand therapy, is a pragmatic outcome that is well suited to definition of the efficacy of on-demand therapy. The goals of treatment of e-GERD should be to relieve symptoms and to heal lesions. Symptom severity and much less endoscopic abnormalities drives the therapeutic choices. When symptoms are mild or intermittent and when oesophagitis is of limited degree, standard dose proton pump inhibitor is usually instituted. Fewer and fewer clinicians would still opt for an H2-receptor antagonist. If there is moderate or severe oesophagitis or if symptoms are particularly troublesome, then the patient should start with standard-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy once a day, but not uncommonly a b.d. dosage maybe necessary. Once the dose of the acid suppressant that relieves symptoms is found, this dose should be maintained for a period of 3 months. After this time, an attempt should be made to reduce the dose. If symptoms recur, then the patients should go back to the full-dose proton pump inhibitor and a plan should be formulated for long-term treatment. The long-term treatment options vary between ongoing acid and suppressant therapy, with occasional attempts to reduce the dose, or to go for 'on demand' therapy and (rarely) includes consideration for surgery or endoscopic anti-reflux therapy.",E,E

Current therapy is targeted at acid suppression, to deal with consequences of mucosal injury and afford resolution of symptoms. Given their modest efficacy, there is no longer much support for initial treatment with H2RAs. PPIs have been shown to provide the highest levels of symptom relief and esophageal healing, in addition to preventing relapse and complications. With this class of agents, the clinician is able to prescribe a drug that is as highly effective as surgery for the purpose intended, without worrying about long term sequelae of acid suppression. It appears that patients with extraesophageal GERD must be treated with higher doses of pharmacologic therapy, principally with the PPIs, for longer periods of time to achieve complete relief of symptoms when compared to patients with heartburn and erosive esophagitis. There is still no clear consensus as to whether aggressive acid suppression alters the natural history of Barrett's esophagus. Based on their initial success, it appears that the next generation of evolving medical therapies will continue to play an important role in the management of GERD.

Preliminary clinical data after 6 months of follow-up show good results in more than 80% of the patients, with objective improvement of acid reflux time. Enteryx is effective in the management of GERD, as evidenced by the ability of GERD patients with a history of use of PPIs and other GERD medications to eliminate or significantly reduce use of these medications. Mechanisms of action of Enteryx implantation suggest a change in distensibility of the LES, allowing a greater competency of the cardia. LES pressure and length might be increased after polymer implantation, and further studies are needed to study the effect of Enteryx on transient relaxations of the LES, which is the prevalent mechanism of reflux in patients with mild GERD. Challenges with this procedure include refining technique to deliver adequate volume in each patient and determining if the ring-shaped implant is needed. In addition to acid reflux, another indication for use of this treatment might be biliary reflux in gastrectomized patients; preliminary data suggest that Enteryx may reduce symptoms and improve bile reflux (J. Devi猫re, unpublished observations, 2002). Further studies are needed to definitively establish the safety of the procedure. This is a major point because gastroenterologists are not dealing with ill patients but primarily with individuals who have a good quality of life while taking PPIs. The other area to investigate is the efficacy of the treatment through a sham-controlled study. Finally, this endoscopic technique will have to be evaluated in terms of cost-effectiveness against medical and surgical therapies.",E,E

Diagnosis and causal therapy may sometimes be difficult with gastroenterologic evaluation sometimes revealing no pathologic result. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of 24-hour intraesophageal pH monitoring with 2 channels (gastric and laryngeal) in the diagnosis of reflux-induced otolaryngologic disorders.; This study included 22 patients presenting to the Department of Otolaryngology with symptoms like chronic cough (n = 3), globus sensation and dysphagia (n = 11), heartburn (n = 2), hoarseness and dysphonia (n = 2) or burning sensation of the tongue (n = 1). Three patients had a pathologic formation in the glottic area (leukoplakia, granuloma, polyp). All patients underwent a otolaryngological examination, a gastroenterological investigation and a 24-hour intraesophageal pH monitoring with 2 channels.; All 22 patients showed laryngeal mucosal lesions (posterior laryngitis). The gastroenterological evaluation with esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal in 4 cases. 13 patients showed a hiatal hernia, 4 patients were suffering from a reflux-esophagitis grade I and 2 patients from grade II. One patient had an erythema and 5 patients showed erosions of the gastric mucosa. Seven patients had more than one of the above mentioned diagnoses. Intraesophageal pH-monitoring with 2 channels over 24 hours revealed a gastroesophageal reflux of all 22 patients and a high reflux to the laryngeal level of 21 patients, probably causing laryngopharyngeal symptoms. Therapy of the patients consisted of medical antireflux treatment with proton pump inhibitor esomeprazol (Nexium, 40 mg, 1-0-0). Within 4 weeks 15 of 22 patients had no more laryngopharyngeal symptoms or at least a significant reduction.; Patients with laryngopharyngeal symptoms such as hoarseness, globus sensation or dysphagia can suffer from GERD, even if typical symptoms such as heartburn or retrosternal pain do not exist and gastroesophageal intervention reveals a normal result. The best diagnostic instrument for the diagnosis of reflux-induced otolaryngologic disorders is a 24-hour intraesophageal pH-monitoring with 2 channels (measure-points at the distal esophagus and laryngeal level). Medical antireflux treatment should consist of proton pump inhibitors (e. g. Nexium) in a dose of 40 mg per day over at least 4 weeks.",E,E

The 90% CI were within the predefined range at all time points; thus, equivalence of pantoprazole and esomeprazole was concluded. For pantoprazole, Cmax and AUC were unchanged on day 7 vs day 1, confirming its high and constant bioavailability. For esomeprazole, Cmax and AUC were increased on day 7 vs day 1 by 80% and 50%, respectively, indicating low initial bioavailability. No clinically relevant side effects were seen for either drug.; Pantoprazole and esomeprazole have equivalent effect on oesophageal pH, since no pathological reflux was detected after treatment with either drug. For esomeprazole, the Cmax and AUC increased after multiple dosing; for pantoprazole the pharmacokinetics were predictable and independent of the number of administered doses.",E,E

The disease management program included evidence-based practice guidelines implemented by using physician champions, academic detailing, and multidisciplinary teams. Processes of care, patient symptoms, quality of life, costs, and work days lost were measured 6 months after patient enrollment.; Compared with usual practice, disease management was associated with improvements in Helicobacter pylori testing (61% vs 9%; P = .001), use of recommended H pylori treatment regimens (96% vs 10%; P = .001), and discontinuation rates of proton pump therapy after treatment (70% vs 36%; P = .04). There were few differences in patient quality of life or symptoms between the 2 study groups. Disease management resulted in fewer days of antisecretory therapy (71.7 vs 88.1 days; P = .02) but no difference in total costs.; This disease management program for patients with acid-related disorders led to improved processes of care.

Gastric biopsy samples were obtained before treatment and on completion of (or discontinuation from) the trials. Samples were evaluated for the presence of H. pylori, characteristics of acute gastritis or atrophic gastritis, and enterochromaffin-like cell pathology.; During treatment with esomeprazole, the number of patients with an improvement in gastric histological scores was typically greater than or equal to the number who worsened. Gastric histological scores worsened for each corporal or antral characteristic of gastritis in <6.2% of patients. Histological scores with esomeprazole and placebo were similar throughout the 6-month trials. Only one among 1326 patients treated with esomeprazole (H. pylori negative) had evidence of treatment-emergent atrophic gastritis. On final biopsy, 5-12% of patients had abnormal enterochromaffin-like cell scores (simple, linear, or micronodular hyperplasia). There were no instances of enterochromaffin-like cell dysplasia, carcinoids, or neoplasia.; Patients with healed erosive esophagitis receiving esomeprazole for up to 12 months had minor fluctuations in gastric histological scores, similar to those experienced in untreated populations. Use of esomeprazole did not raise any safety concerns with respect to the development of atrophic gastritis, or cause clinically significant changes in enterochromaffin-like cells.",E,E

The aim of the study was to estimate and compare the prevalence of EED in a population with symptomatic GERD presenting as either erosive reflux disease (ERD) or non-erosive reflux disease (NERD).; Baseline data were collected from a prospective, multicentre, open cohort study (ProGERD) in which patients will be followed for 5 years after initial treatment with esomeprazole. Within the framework of this trial, all patients underwent gastroscopy and filled out a questionnaire designed to assess EED. The influence of potential prognostic factors on the prevalence of EED was analysed by multivariate (stepwise logistic regression) analysis.; 6215 patients (3303 male, 2912 female; mean age 54 years) presenting with heartburn were included. EED was detected in 32.8% of all patients. The proportion was significantly higher (P = 0.0002) in ERD patients (34.9%) than in NERD patients (30.5%). As judged from the multivariate analysis, female gender, age, oesophagitis of LA grade C/D, duration of GERD disease greater than 1 years and smoking were significantly associated with EED. ERD patients with oesophagitis of LA grade A or B did not have a significantly higher risk of EED than patients with NERD.; Patients with GERD have a high probability of experiencing EED, which may be associated with a number of prognostic factors such as duration and severity of GERD.

Celecoxib, a coxib NSAID, has no proven advantages over these other NSAIDs. (2) Rofecoxib is the second coxib to be approved in this indication. The clinical evaluation file shows that the optimal daily dose is 25 mg. (3) A comparative trial in more than 8 000 patients, showed that rofecoxib was no more effective than 1 g/day of naproxen. There are no trials comparing rofecoxib with celecoxib, diclofenac or ibuprofen. (4) In clinical trials the overall frequencies of adverse effects and treatment withdrawals for adverse effects were the same for rofecoxib as for other NSAIDs. In one trial, rofecoxib caused fewer gastrointestinal disturbances, particularly serious ones, than naproxen. But rofecoxib caused more gastrointestinal disturbances than placebo. During postmarketing follow up in the United States, a number of deaths due to gastrointestinal complications on rofecoxib were reported. Rofecoxib carries the same renal risk as other NSAIDs. An excess risk of cardiovascular events cannot be ruled out. (5) In practice, the advent of rofecoxib in no way influences the choice of NSAID for symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",E,E

Particular attention is given to recent evidence relating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori ) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to ulcer recurrence after operative therapy. MEDLINE word searches of the literature from 1966 to 2001 identified 895 articles that cross-reference the terms ""peptic ulcer disease (PUD),"" ""surgery,"" and ""recurrence."" Articles were selected for systematic review of evidence relating incomplete vagotomy, NSAIDs, and H. pylori to postoperative ulcer recurrence and evidence supporting common medical and surgical strategies. The relationship between incomplete vagotomy and recurrent ulcer disease is suggested by randomized controlled trials and well-designed prospective case series. The evidence that NSAID use is an important pathogenic factor in recurrent ulcer disease includes the relationship between NSAIDs and primary PUD, the occurrence of NSAID-induced ulcers in patients taking proton pump inhibitors, and case series demonstrating virulent ulcer disease in patients taking aspirin despite prior acid-reducing operations. The relationship between H. pylori infection and postoperative ulcer recurrence remains uncertain despite multiple controlled trials and well-designed case series that have documented high rates of H. pylori infection in postoperative patients. The initial management of patients with recurrent ulcer disease after acid-reducing operations consists of a protein pump inhibitor or a histamine-2 receptor antagonist and antibiotics directed at H. pylori, if present. Evidence for this regimen includes prospective randomized trials demonstrating the efficacy of cimetidine in healing ulcers after acid-reducing operations and prospective, randomized studies documenting the efficacy of histamine-2 receptor antagonists and protein pump inhibitors in the management of patients with primary PUD. The critical role that H. pylori infection plays in primary PUD and the minimal risks associated with H. pylori eradication strongly support the initiation of antibiotic therapy when H. pylori is present. The principal indication for operative management of recurrent PUD is the occurrence of ulcer complications that cannot be managed by medical or endoscopic means. The operative management of patients with failed acid-reducing operations is based on ulcer recurrence rates and morbidity and mortality rates in randomized and nonrandomized prospective trials of patients with primary PUD and retrospective case series of patients undergoing remedial operative procedures after various failed acid-reducing operations.",E,E

We review here the major current challenges in the field of reflux disease and its complications, and provide some approaches that may be useful in management. The issues to be faced include the very limited comprehension of the reasons behind the increasing prevalence of the disease, difficulties in correlating symptoms with objective data of pathological gastroesophageal reflux and the relatively unsophisticated tools we are employing to investigate the underlying pathophysiology. It is certain that the lack of well-defined and characterized methodologies to compare the effects of therapy require the development of more effective questionnaire-type analytic tools. In regard to treatment, there is little doubt that the widely prescribed proton pump inhibitors have dose-equivalent efficacy and are the most highly effective agents capable of suppressing acid, controlling many of the symptoms of GERD and healing erosions. Nevertheless, many patients continue to experience symptoms on withdrawal or at night. Pharmacological agents that can effectively increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure or promote motility are as yet unavailable. Although the introduction of laparoscopic techniques has resulted in a modest revival in surgical intervention using a variety of 'wrap-type' operations, the indications are few and the procedure is associated with a significant morbidity and even mortality especially if the expertise of the surgeon is an issue. Endoscopic techniques of regulating reflux are at this time experimental and not applicable to the general population. Intestinal metaplasia in the lower esophagus is probably very common. Whether and how to, first, screen for, and then, perform surveillance in Barrett's esophagus remains highly problematic and contentious.",E,E

Research is needed to streamline evaluation to minimize unnecessary invasive testing and costs. Chest pain clinics to assess chest pain patients are popular in the United States and may be of value in reassuring patients and reducing presentation to hospital; however, recently this has been contended [111]. Options for the effective treatment of NCCP are dependent on the risk of an adverse outcome and the cost-effectiveness of the management algorithm that is followed. Most (64%) of those presenting to the emergency department with chest pain are classified as having NCCP [112,113]. GERD is probably the most important cause and application of a test of acid suppression with a high-dose PPI for 1 to 2 weeks seems to be a useful diagnostic tool. In those patients with GERD-related NCCP, short-term and potentially long-term therapy with a PPI (commonly higher than standard dose) is required to alleviate symptoms. Esophageal dysmotility is relatively uncommon in patients with NCCP and evaluation by esophageal manometry might be limited to rule out achalasia. Chest wall syndromes are common but probably often missed. Many patients with NCCP have psychologic or psychiatric abnormalities, as either the cause or an effect of the chest pain, but diagnosis here depends on techniques not applied easily in the acute situation. Pain modulators seem to offer significant improvement in chest pain symptoms for non-GERD-related NCCP. Finally, trials of management strategies to deal with this problem are required urgently, because the earlier discharge of patients with NCCP may exacerbate the problem.

Although clinical tests are available, significant percentages of patients report symptoms of heartburn and reflux despite negative endoscopies, and 24-hour pH tests are not often used by primary-care physicians in diagnosis. Consequently, patient-reported symptoms and health-related QOL (HR-QOL) are important in assessing treatment outcome. HR-QOL is significantly impaired in patients with GORD, and HR-QOL is associated with symptom severity and changes in GORD-related symptoms. The objective of this literature review is to examine the impact of pharmacological treatment on HR-QOL in patients with GORD. Generic and disease-specific HR-QOL measures have been used in clinical trials to evaluate the impact of GORD on patient functioning and well-being. The Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) Index and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) have been used in several clinical trials of treatment for GORD and have consistently shown that HR-QOL improves with successful therapy. These trials have been conducted primarily with two pharmacological agents, omeprazole and ranitidine. On the Heartburn-specific Quality of Life questionnaire, patients treated with ranitidine reported better HR-QOL after treatment compared with placebo therapy. In two clinical trials where omeprazole and ranitidine were compared, patients treated with omeprazole reported significantly better HR-QOL (based on the PGWB Index) than those treated with ranitidine; however, 2 other trials did not detect significant differences between the treatments. Results from clinical trials using disease-specific measures (Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index [GIQLI] and Heartburn-specific Quality of Life questionnaire) demonstrate similar findings, supporting the association between treatment-related symptom resolution and improvements in HR-QOL. The GIQLI was used in a trial comparing pantoprazole and ranitidine, where results favoured pantoprazole therapy. Several studies have demonstrated that resolution of GORD symptoms is associated with improvement in HR-QOL. Although there is evidence that treatment for GORD does improve symptoms and HR-QOL outcomes, further research is needed to more completely understand the value of medical therapy for GORD.",E,E

Most patients with dyspepsia, however, are treated by their primary care physician. This study evaluated the test-and-treat strategy in primary care.; Patients consulting their general practitioners for dyspepsia were randomized to either direct open-access endoscopy with Helicobacter pylori testing or a test-and-treat strategy by H pylori serology. In the 12-month follow-up period, any additional treatment or referral for investigations was left at the discretion of the general practitioner. At the end of the study, data were collected concerning the number of endoscopies, changes in symptom severity and quality of life, patient satisfaction, and the use of medical resources.; Two hundred seventy patients were enrolled (129 who received endoscopy and 141 in the test-and-treat group). The prevalence of H pylori infection was 38.3% and 37.2% in the test-and-treat and endoscopy groups, respectively. In the test-and-treat group, 46 patients (33%) were referred for endoscopy during follow-up. Improvement in symptom severity, quality of life, and patient satisfaction was comparable in both groups. Patients in the test-and-treat group paid more dyspepsia-related visits to their general practitioner (P =.005). Patients in the endoscopy group were more often prescribed proton pump inhibitors (P =.007), whereas patients in the test-and-treat group were more often prescribed prokinetic drugs (P =.005).; The test-and-treat strategy proved to be as effective and safe as prompt endoscopy.

In the absence of an objective marker such as erosions, assessment of treatment efficacy can be based on symptoms and HRQoL.; To evaluate changes in HRQoL during treatment with pantoprazole or nizatidine in patients with GERD.; This was a prospective, randomized, double blind Canadian multicenter study. Patients with GERD, characterized by heartburn that had occurred 4 or more times per week for at least 6 months, were treated for 28 days with either pantoprazole 40 mg once daily or nizatidine 150 mg twice daily. HRQoL assessment was performed before endoscopy (baseline) and on days 7 and 28 after treatment. HRQoL was assessed using 4 domains of the SF-36, the SF-12 summary scales and the gastrointestinal system rating scale (GSRS).; A total of 208 patients (n = 106 pantoprazole treatment group, n = 102 nizatidine treatment group) was available for intention-to-treat analysis. Baseline HRQoL scores were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. After 7 days, treatment with pantoprazole led to a statistically significant greater improvement in HRQoL in 2 SF-36 domains: bodily pain (pantoprazole versus nizatidine, P = 0.0088) and vitality (pantoprazole versus nizatidine, P = 0.0137), and in the GSRS reflux score (pantoprazole versus nizatidine, P = 0.0078). After 28 days of treatment, the changes in scores relative to baseline were still greater with pantoprazole than with nizatidine. The improvement in the 4 SF-36 domains and the GSRS reflux score achieved by pantoprazole after 7 days were also significantly greater than those achieved by nizatidine after 28 days.; HRQoL improves more rapidly and to a greater degree following treatment with pantoprazole than nizatidine. Control of heartburn strongly predicts HRQoL improvement during the acute treatment of GERD. Our data support the approach to use pantoprazole instead of nizatidine as the initial therapy for patients with heartburn in a primary care practice setting.",E,E

In most instances, Hp colonization occurs in early childhood, and correlates with socioeconomic parameters. Helicobacter pylori infection is highly prevalent in many countries, and may cause chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer in adults and in children. Gastritis induced by Hp may be associated with recurrent abdominal pain in children, and eradication of the bacterium may improve the clinical symptoms. AIM The primary aim of this study is to characterize the group of pediatric patients according to the referral patterns and results of 13C-urea breath test (13C -UBT) in our laboratory. The secondary aim is to investigate the result of different treatment combinations for Hp eradication.; The 13C-UBT was performed with 75 mg urea labeled with 13C in 200 mL orange juice. Breath samples were collected at 0 and 30 minutes, and the results expressed as the change in the 13C/12C ratio at T30' minus T0' The cutoff for Hp eradication was 3.5. The physicians who ordered the test completed a questionnaire covering demographic data (age, gender, and origin), indication for the test was use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and type of combination eradication therapy.; The study sample consisted of 1655 children, aged 1 to 18 years, 992 (59.9%) boys and 663 (40.1%) girls, from all parts of the country. The 13C-UBT was positive in 763 (46.1%). The prevalence of positive results was directly correlated with age. History of peptic disease was the main indication for the test, in 1346 (81.4%) cases. Details on eradication therapy were available for 435 children of whom 42.5% had a positive 13C-UBT, indicating a successful eradication rate of 57.5%. Compared with Israeli and American-European origin, children of Asian-African origin had a higher rate of referrals for reason of validation of successful Hp eradication, greater long-term PPI use, and a higher rate of 13C-UBT positivity. No significant difference was demonstrated between the triple therapy regimens used.; 13C-UBT may be performed in children of all age groups. The main indication is a history of peptic ulcer disease. The prevalence of Hp infection increased with age and the only factor associated with increased Hp infection was Asian-African origin. The most frequent eradication therapy used in children is a combination of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin.",E,E

Therapeutic options include lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, laparoscopic antireflux surgery, and three more recent options-injection therapy to the lower esophageal sphincter, endoscopic sewing procedures, and radio frequency ablation therapy. Medical therapy is effective in most patients but not always successful with advanced disease. Up to 70% of subjects do not have adequate nocturnal control of gastric acid secretion with 20 mg of omeprazole given twice per day. Patients who do not tolerate medical therapy, who respond inadequately, or who want to avoid life-long drug therapy are candidates for alternate treatments. Studies on endoscopic procedures such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) injection, the Stretta procedure,and endoscopic suturing techniques all suffer from having small study groups for each procedure,unknown durability, short follow-up, and the absence of randomized, controlled procedures. Limitations on endoscopic techniques are esophageal motility disorders, severe esophagitis, and larger hiatal hernias. Laparoscopic antireflux surgery remains a well-established, durable alternative to long-term medical therapy. It has the benefits of convenience, safety, minimal complications, improved quality of life, and low cost. Alternative methods will have to earn their place against this gold standard.",E,E

Assessments of the clinical and economic effectiveness of PPIs would provide useful tools for decision-making.; The goal of this study was to review the available preclinical and clinical studies comparing esomeprazole with lansoprazole in the healing and maintenance of erosive esophagitis, and to compare the budgeting impact of the 2 strategies. Comparative tolerability was also reviewed.; MEDLINE (1966-September 2002) and EMBASE (1980-September 2002) were searched for abstracts and articles reporting comparative studies of esomeprazole and lansoprazole. The search terms used were gastroesophageal reflux disease, reflux esophagitis, and proton pump inhibitor; all comparisons of esomeprazole and lansoprazole at any dose were considered. The database search was supplemented based on the authors' familiarity with the literature.; The comparative studies that were identified fell into 4 categories: (1) intragastric acid suppression studies; (2) randomized controlled trials in the healing of erosive esophagitis; (3) randomized controlled trials in the maintenance of erosive esophagitis; and (4) health economic analyses. Based on these studies, when healing doses (esomeprazole 40 mg once daily, lansoprazole 30 mg once daily) and low doses (20 and 15 mg once daily, respectively) were compared, esomeprazole was more efficacious than lansoprazole in suppressing acid in the intragastric compartment (both comparisons, P < 0.05). More patients with erosive esophagitis experienced healing at 4 and 8 weeks with esomeprazole 40 mg once daily than with lansoprazole 30 mg once daily (P < 0.001 at 4 and 8 weeks). At 6 months, remission was maintained in more patients receiving esomeprazole 20 mg once daily than in those receiving lansoprazole 15 mg once daily (P < 0.001). No significant differences in tolerability were noted in clinical trials that directly compared the 2 PPIs. When the cost-effectiveness of esomeprazole treatment was compared with that of lansoprazole treatment in the healing and maintenance of erosive esophagitis, the greater efficacy of esomeprazole translated into potential cost savings and better outcomes.; The currently available comparative data for esomeprazole and lansoprazole indicate clinical and cost-effectiveness advantages for esomeprazole in the healing and maintenance of erosive esophagitis compared with lansoprazole.",E,E

To address this challenge, the authors examined the potential influence of development and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) genotype on omeprazole disposition by conducting two pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in children and adolescents (ages 2-16 years) after a single oral 10- or 20-mg dose of the drug. Plasma omeprazole concentrations were determined by HPLC-MS from seven plasma samples obtained over a 6-hour postdose period. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental methods. Subjects were genotyped for CYP2C19 by PCR-RFLP. Data were available from 37 patients (19 female), 10 of whom were < or = 5 years of age. No drug-associated adverse events were observed. The numbers of functional CYP2C19 alleles per subject in the cohort were 2 (n = 25), 1 (n = 11), and 0 (n = 1). Pharmacokinetic parameters (mean +/- SD, range) were as follows: tmax (2.1 +/- 1.2, 1-6 h), Cmax (331.1 +/- 333.6, 20.8-885.8 ng/mL), AUC0-->infinity (809.5 +/- 893.8, 236.9-1330.9 ng/mL.h), t1/2 (0.98 +/- 0.22, 0.7-1.4 h), and CL/F (1.8 +/- 1.4, 0.3-5.8 L/h/kg). Comparison of mean AUC0-->infinity values normalized for dose (i.e., per 1 mg/kg) between subjects with one versus two functional CYP2C19 alleles revealed no statistically significant difference. In addition, the CL/F and apparent elimination rate constant (lambda z) for omeprazole were not significantly different for subjects with one versus two functional CYP2C19 alleles. No association between age and CL/F, t1/2, or lambda z was observed. The range of t1/2 values for omeprazole was similar to those reported in adults (1-1.5 h).; (1) in children ages 2 to 16 years receiving 10 or 20 mg of omeprazole as a single oral dose, the PK are quite comparable to values reported for adults, and (2) in pediatric patients who are CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers, there was no association between genotype and the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole.",E,E

Recently four reports have shown a cure rate of approximately 90% using a four-day quadruple therapy. The objectives of this prospective study were: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of pantoprazole-based quadruple therapy, and 2) to compare the efficacy and tolerability of four-day with seven-day quadruple therapy.; The study was performed in a single centre. The first 56 consecutive patients with nonulcer dyspepsia or peptic ulcer disease and proven H. pylori infection received seven days of quadruple therapy (pantoprazole, bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole). At least six weeks after treatment, endoscopy was repeated with six biopsies of the antrum and corpus for histology, urease test and culture. The next 59 consecutive patients followed the same protocol but received four-day quadruple therapy.; Using an intention-to-treat analysis, the cure rate in the seven-day treatment group was 54/56 (96.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 87.7-99.6%). In the per protocol analysis the cure rate was 53/55 (96.3%, 95% CI 87.5-99.6%). Primary metronidazole resistance was observed in seven patients. All were cured. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, the cure rate in the four-day treatment group was 51/59 (86.4%, 95% CI 75.0-94.0%). In the per protocol analysis the cure rate was 50/58 (86.2%, 95% CI 74.6-93.8%). Primary metronidazole resistance was observed in seven patients, four of whom were cured. In three out of eight patients in whom four-day treatment failed, secondary metronidazole resistance was induced. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. The difference between cure rates of both regimens did not reach statistical significance (p=0.0585).; Routine use of both four-day and seven-day pantoprazole-based quadruple anti-H. pylori treatment is effective and well tolerated. The results of both regimens reach the required eradication standard, but results with the seven-day regimen were slightly but not significantly better. Seven-day treatment may be superior, especially in case of metronidazole resistance, and should be preferred.",E,E

On-demand treatment with proton pump inhibitors or H2-receptor antagonists is safe and cost-effective. Indications are: (a) incidental reflux episodes of short duration, (b) periodic reflux lasting several weeks or months, (c) chronic reflux not requiring continuous treatment. On-demand treatment is unsuitable for patients with reflux disease who either require daily medication or in whom the maximal dosage is insufficient. There are three types of on-demand treatment. Type 1: use of medication only in case of incidental symptoms. Type 2: continuous medication for 2-4 weeks when symptoms appear. Type 3: continuous use because of chronic symptoms, but the interval between doses is determined by the patient on the basis of his symptoms. All antacids can in principle be used for on-demand treatment; for type 3 treatment, antacids with a rapid onset of action are preferred. A favourable response to the two weeks of initial therapy is a good predictor for successful on-demand treatment.",E,E

Pantoprazole inhibits acid more powerfully than histamine H(2) receptor antagonists (H(2)RAs) and omperazole 20 mg and raises median 24-h gastric pH from about 1.5 to 3-4 in healthy volunteers and in duodenal ulcer patients to above 5. Results from studies have confirmed that pantoprazole is superior to H(2)RAs in speed of healing and symptom relief in patients with peptic ulcer. In patients with duodenal ulcer pantoprazole was as effective as omperazole 20 mg and in patients with gastric ulcer pantoprazole was statistically superior to omeprazole 20 mg after 4 weeks. In triple combination therapy of peptic ulcer disease, the mean eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori in data pooled from 32 pantoprazole-based studies was 86% and compliance with treatment was about 90%. Results pooled from 5 large clinical trials of gastroesophageal reflux disease showed healing rates significantly superior to those achieved with H(2)RAs and similar to those of other PPIs at 4 and 8 weeks. Symptom relief was more rapid with pantoprazole and maintenance treatment kept the majority of patients in remission; relapse rates at 1 year were 25-28% on 20 mg daily and 6-22% on 40 mg daily. Maintenance treatment with pantoprazole 40 mg has been shown to keep most patients with aggressive or refractory ulcer and reflux disease in remission for up to 3 years. Pantoprazole was also effective in the management of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In volunteers given aspirin, pantoprazole 40 mg proved significantly superior to ranitidine and placebo in preventing the development of mucosal damage and was significantly better than placebo in preventing gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer in arthritic patients on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance and long-term studies have confirmed that pantoprazole is effective and safe for the short- and long-term management of peptic ulcer and reflux disease, with side effects similar in incidence and type to those of H(2)RAs.",E,E

Previous studies have illustrated the success of step-down from proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to less-expensive therapy once symptoms have abated. This study was conducted to determine whether patients requiring greater than single-dose PPI for initial symptom resolution could be stepped-down to single-dose PPI and whether this intervention decreased costs or adversely affected quality of life.; Consecutive patients in whom greater than single-dose PPI had completely alleviated reflux-type symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation) were recruited through the use of pharmacy records of PPI prescriptions. Eligible subjects completed baseline demographic information and quality-of-life surveys and were stepped-down to single-dose PPI (lansoprazole 30 mg or omeprazole 20 mg daily). Follow-up continued for 6 months or until subjects reported recurrence of reflux-type symptoms, at which point PPIs were reinstituted at the dose that had originally alleviated the subjects' symptoms. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects in whom step-down was successful, defined as no recurrence of reflux-type symptoms on single-dose PPI.; A total of 117 subjects enrolled in the study; all were followed to the primary endpoint. 79.5% did not report recurrent symptoms of heartburn or acid regurgitation during the 6 months after step-down to single-dose PPI. Logistic regression revealed that longer duration of PPI use before study enrollment was associated with greater likelihood of symptom recurrence with step-down. Although quality of life was not significantly altered, dyspepsia (excluding reflux-type symptoms) increased. Overall costs of management were reduced.; The majority of patients rendered asymptomatic on greater than single-dose PPI might be subsequently stepped-down to single-dose therapy without recurrence of reflux-type symptoms. This intervention can decrease management costs without adversely affecting quality of life.",I,4

Currently, three basic techniques are approved for use in the United States. To date, clinical trials have examined either a thermal approach, endoscopic suturing, or injection intervention in the area of the lower esophageal sphincter. However, the trials for each type of endoscopically directed therapy have varied in methodologic design and data analysis. It is important to recognize these differences when attempting to compare the efficacy and outcomes for each endoscopic therapy. Additionally, the risk/benefit profile must be carefully evaluated for each of these interventions before considering it a viable treatment strategy.",E,E

Isolation of H. pylori from the stomach mucosa changed the erstwhile widely held belief that the stomach contains no bacteria and is actually sterile. Once H. pylori is safely ensconced in the mucus, it is able to neutralize the acid in the stomach by elaborating an enzyme called urease. Urease converts urea, of which there is an abundant supply in the stomach (derived from saliva and the gastric juice), into bicarbonate and ammonia, which are strong bases. These bases form a cloud of acid-neutralizing chemicals in the vicinity of the organisms, protecting them from the acid in the stomach. This urea hydrolysis reaction is utilized for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection in the urea breath test (UBT) and the rapid urease test (RUT). In Japan, both invasive tests, such as bacterial culture, histopathology and RUT, and non-invasive tests such as UBT and serology are conducted for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. For confirming the results of eradication therapy, UBT is considered to be the most sensitive and specific. In order to treat H. pylori infection, a new one-week triple therapy regimen (lansoprazole or omeprazole + amoxicillin + clarithromycin) has been approved for use in patients with peptic ulcer disease in Japan. As for H. pylori eradication in the case of other diseases in which the bacterium has been implicated (e.g., chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric MALT lymphoma, gastric cancer, non-ulcer dyspepsia, chronic urticaria, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)), further basic and clinical investigation is required.",E,E

Because either belching or heartburn may result from transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, it has been proposed that belching may be a manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In this retrospective study we evaluated the prevalence of belching in dyspepsia and GERD and the relation of belching to acid reflux events documented by pH monitoring.; We examined the prevalence, frequency, and severity of belching and other GERD symptoms by use of standardized questionnaires in 180 GERD patients (group A) and 78 dyspeptic controls (group B) referred for evaluation at our institution. GERD was defined as either endoscopic esophagitis (or Barrett's esophagus) or positive DeMeester score (>14.2) on pH monitoring or both. Dyspeptic patients had normal endoscopy and pH studies. We also analyzed the relationship of belching to acid reflux events during the 24-h period of pH studies.; Of 180 GERD patients, 132 (70%) reported belching during pH monitoring, versus 63 of 78 dyspeptic patients (80%) (p = ns). Similarly, 163 of 180 GERD patients (90%) reported heartburn versus 64 of 78 of dyspeptic patients (82%) (p = ns). Review of symptom questionnaires revealed no significant difference in belching severity between groups. However, heartburn and acid regurgitation were significantly more severe among GERD patients. There was a significantly higher correlation of both heartburn and belching with acid events in patients with GERD compared with patients with dyspepsia. In addition, although both belching and heartburn were significantly improved in patients with GERD, belching scores remained unchanged after proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in patients with dyspepsia.; Belching is as common and as severe in patients with dyspepsia as it is in patients with GERD. Belching and heartburn in GERD patients are more likely correlated with episodes of pathological acid reflux. Because belching cannot be clinically used as a discriminatory symptom, ambulatory pH monitoring should be considered to elucidate the relationship of belching to acid reflux in patients with dyspepsia or GERD.",E,E

Chronic abnormal gastric reflux results in erosive esophagitis in up to 60% of patients with GERD. Esophageal stricture, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma are the most serious complications of GERD. Although heartburn and acid regurgitation are the most common complaints, extraesophageal symptoms such as noncardiac chest pain, laryngitis, coughing, and wheezing can be manifestations of GERD. Unfortunately, the severity of symptoms is not a reliable indicator of the severity of erosive esophagitis. Endoscopy is the preferred method to diagnose and grade erosive esophagitis, and various classification systems are used to grade disease severity. The Los Angeles Classification is a valid and widely accepted system to evaluate the severity of erosive esophagitis. The immediate goals of treatment are to provide effective symptomatic relief and to achieve healing in patients with esophageal damage. The treatment regimen often begins by prescribing a therapy to reduce gastric acid secretion. A proton pump inhibitor is the preferred agent for many patients. Because GERD is a chronic, relapsing disease, long-term maintenance therapy is usually necessary to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and improve the quality of life in patients with GERD.",E,E

Decision analysis was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of COX-2 therapy. Actual health plan drug claims data were used to determine utilization and prescribing patterns of nonspecific NSAIDs, COX-2 specific inhibitors, and PPIs. Results from the literature from 8 clinical trials were employed to determine the probability of a serious gastrointestinal (GI) event. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was used to determine the cost of each therapy, including the predicted cost to treat a serious GI event in a drug benefit design with PA versus a benefit design without PA.; Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) showed that the cost per success no serious GI event) for Cox-2 specific inhibitors with PA was US dollars 278 versus US dollars 422 without PA.; The one-year model predicted that costs associated with an increase in COX-2 utilization after removal of PA would exceed the costs to administer PA and treat NSAID-related serious GI events in the managed care population. Based upon this CEA, PA appears to be an effective tool to manage COX-2 pharmacy costs. Further examination of the medical claims would be useful to validate the assumed GI event rates with or without PA and to further demonstrate more definitively the value of a PA program for COX-2 drugs.",6,E

This article reviews EER, discussing epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment with a focus on the most studied and convincing EER disorders-asthma, cough, and laryngitis. Although EER comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders, some general characterizations can be made, as follows. First, although GERD's association with extraesophageal diseases is well-established, definitive evidence of causation has been more elusive, rendering epidemiological data scarce. Secondly, regarding the pathogenesis of EER, 2 basic models have been proposed: direct injury to extraesophageal tissue by acid and pepsin exposure or injury mediated through an esophageal reflex mechanism. Third, because heartburn and regurgitation are often absent in patients with EER, GERD may not be suspected. Even when GERD is suspected, the diagnosis may be difficult to confirm. Although endoscopy and barium esophagram remain important tools for detecting esophageal complications, they may fail to establish the presence of GERD. Even when GERD is diagnosed by endoscopy or barium esophagram, causation between GERD and extraesophageal symptoms cannot be determined. Esophageal pH is the most sensitive tool for detecting GERD, and it plays an important role in EER. However, even pH testing cannot establish GERD's causative relationship to extraesophageal symptoms. In this regard, effective treatment of GERD resulting in significant improvement or remission of the extraesophageal symptoms provides the best evidence for GERD's pathogenic role. Finally, EER generally requires more prolonged and aggressive antisecretory therapy than typical GERD requires.",5,E

Simple lifestyle modifications are the first methods employed by patients and, because of their low cost and simplicity, should be continued even when more potent therapies are initiated. Potent acid-suppressive therapy is currently the most important and successful medical therapy. Whereas healing of the esophageal mucosa is achieved with a single dose of any proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in more than 80% of cases, symptoms are more difficult to control. Patients with persistent symptoms on therapy should be tested (preferably with combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH) for association of symptoms with acid, nonacid, or no GER. Long-term follow-up studies indicate that PPIs are efficacious, tolerable, and safe medication. So far, promotility agents have shown limited efficacy, and their side-effect profile outweighs their benefits. Antireflux surgery in carefully selected patients (ie, young, typical GERD symptoms, abnormal pH study, and good response to PPI) is as effective as PPI therapy and should be offered to these patients as an alternative to medication. Still, patients should be informed about the risks of antireflux surgery (ie, risk of postoperative dysphagia; decreased ability to belch, possibly leading to bloating; increased flatulence). Endoscopic antireflux procedures are recommended only in selected patients and given the relative short experience with these techniques, patients treated with endoscopic procedures should be enrolled in a rigorous follow-up program.",5,E

H. pylori target DNA could not be detected in the stools of any of the 24 infected patients. It was concluded that there was no substantial shedding of H. pylori in feces from either group of patients.",E,E

A reappraisal of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and its therapeutic efficacy in acid-related disorders.",2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles; Animals; Anti-Ulcer Agents; Humans; Lansoprazole; Omeprazole; Stomach Ulcer,"Spencer, C M; Faulds, D","Lansoprazole is a benzimidazole derivative that effectively decreases gastric acid secretion, regardless of the primary stimulus, via inhibition of gastric H+,K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). It provides effective symptom relief and healing of peptic ulcer and reflux oesophagitis after 4 to 8 weeks of therapy and appears to prevent recurrence of lesions when administered as maintenance therapy. When administered at therapeutic dosages, lansoprazole produced higher healing rates than ranitidine or famotidine in patients with duodenal and gastric ulcers. Lansoprazole heals duodenal ulcers more rapidly than ranitidine or famotidine. Relief of ulcer symptoms in lansoprazole recipients is at least equivalent to, and tends to be more rapid than, that in patients receiving histamine H2-receptor antagonists. In comparisons with omeprazole 20 mg/day, lansoprazole 30 mg/day produced duodenal ulcer healing more rapidly and reduced ulcer pain to a greater extent at 2 weeks, but overall healing rates were similar after 4 weeks of therapy. At therapeutic dosages, lansoprazole produces superior healing and symptom relief of reflux oesophagitis in comparison with ranitidine, and it tends to relieve heartburn more effectively than omeprazole, although both agents produce equivalent healing. Healing of peptic ulcers or reflux oesophagitis refractory to histamine H2-receptor antagonists occurs after 8 weeks in the majority of patients treated with lansoprazole, and lansoprazole and omeprazole demonstrate similar efficacy in patients with refractory peptic ulcers. In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, lansoprazole effectively controls mean basal gastric acid output. Lansoprazole is generally well tolerated in clinical trials. The incidence of adverse effects is similar to that of omeprazole, ranitidine and famotidine in comparative studies. Combination therapy with lansoprazole and antibacterial agents such as amoxicillin, tinidazole, roxithromycin and/or metronidazole appears to eradicate Helicobacter pylori in 22 to 80% of patients with this organism. Limited data also suggest that lansoprazole may have superior activity against H. pylori in comparison with omeprazole, although the clinical relevance of this preliminary finding requires further confirmation. Thus, lansoprazole may be considered as alternative to existing antisecretory agents available for the treatment of acid-related disorders, particularly because it may provide more rapid healing and relief of symptoms.",E,E

Diagnosis of the condition can often be made on the basis of symptomatology alone. Endoscopy can help in assessing the degree of esophageal damage, influencing the choice of therapy, and should be performed at least once during a symptomatic patient's lifetime to exclude a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus. However, endoscopy is mandatory at diagnosis if alarm symptoms are present. Treatment should aim to provide the lowest degree of acid suppression needed for the control of symptoms. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent the most cost-effective treatment option for the short- and long-term management of GERD. Compared with standard- and high-dose H2-receptor antagonists, PPIs result in superior and faster healing and symptom relief across all grades of esophagitis and are more effective at maintaining patients in symptomatic and endoscopic remission. Treatment with PPIs has also been shown to reduce the rate of recurrent stricture after initial dilatation. PPIs are generally well tolerated, and to date there have been no reports of gastric dysplasia resulting from their long-term use. Anti-reflux surgery should be reserved for patients who are unresponsive to continuous PPI therapy or perhaps for young patients. It will be several years before the impact of laparoscopic fundoplication as a cost-beneficial therapy for GERD can be assessed.; The superior clinical efficacy of PPIs when compared with any other drug regimen for GERD make them the treatment of choice for the short- and long-term management of this troublesome condition.",E,E

All the patients were initially treated with omeprazole (40 mg orally once a day) for four to eight weeks, and healing was confirmed by endoscopy. Participants were then stratified according to their initial grade of esophagitis and randomly assigned to 12 months of treatment with one of the following: cisapride (10 mg three times a day), ranitidine (150 mg three times a day), omeprazole (20 mg per day), ranitidine plus cisapride (10 mg three times a day), or omeprazole plus cisapride.

The multifactorial pathogenesis of GORD prevents medical cure of the disease. GORD is a chronic disease with a high tendency to relapse, requiring a long term treatment strategy in practically all patients. Complete healing of all mucosal lesions is not necessarily the aim of treatment in all patients. In milder forms of reflux disease, symptom relief is the most important goal. Many patients with mild GORD do well on symptomatic self-care with antacids and/or alginate. In addition, lifestyle changes should be advised to all patients: these improve symptoms and enhance the efficacy of therapy. In the acute treatment of GORD the prokinetic drug cisapride has been shown to be effective in relieving symptoms and healing grade I to II oesophagitis. Cisapride decreases symptomatic and endoscopic relapse in patients with mild GORD. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists are effective in relieving reflux symptoms in about 50% of patients, but with regard to healing, H2-antagonists appear to be mainly effective in grades I and II and not in higher grades of oesophagitis. Maintenance treatment with H2-antagonists is mainly symptomatically effective in patients with mild GORD. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) provide significantly higher healing rates of reflux oesophagitis than H2-antagonists, even in the more severe cases of oesophagitis and Barrett's ulcers. PPIs are also effective in patients with oesophagitis refractory to treatment with H2-antagonists. PPIs have become the drugs of first choice in healing of all patients with more severe forms of reflux oesophagitis, and increasingly also for patients with milder forms of oesophagitis, certainly those who fail to respond to other drugs. In maintenance treatment of GORD, PPIs are the most effective drugs, offering the possibility of keeping nearly all patients in remission with adjusted doses. Current patient data of up to 5 years indicate the safety of this strategy for this period, but the exact consequences of strong acid inhibition over a longer period still have to be clarified. At present, all but a few patients with GORD can be managed adequately by medical therapy.",E,E

The case for and against eradication is critically discussed. Eradication of H. pylori should be pursued in all patients with peptic ulcer disease, whether they are using NSAIDs or not. Eradication of H. pylori in the treatment of NUD should be considered experimental. Treatment aimed at the eradication of H. pylori should be considered in all patients with low-grade malignant mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and in all patients with M茅n茅trier's disease. Finally, this treatment should be considered in a subset of H. pylori-infected patients who possibly are at an increased risk of gastric cancer: patients with a strong family history of gastric carcinoma and patients in need of long-term treatment with a proton-pump inhibitor. In view of the importance of patient compliance, the risk of side-effects and the possibility of inducing metronidazole resistance when treatment with a metronidazole-containing regimen is used, treatment aimed at the eradication of H. pylori should be carefully implemented and monitored.",E,E

Flexible endoscopy enables accurate diagnosis of peptic ulcer to be made and its introduction made possible the large number of controlled clinical trials on the use of various agents in peptic ulcer treatment. The histamine H-2 receptor antagonists, which reduce gastric acid output, were the first major group of potent ulcer healing drugs introduced. Subsequently, other ulcer healing agents with different modes of action, e.g. colloidal bismuth, sucralfate, prostaglandin analogues, omeprazole were also shown to be effective. The identification of Helicobacter pylori ten years ago was another major advance in peptic ulcer disease. This bacterium is now thought to be the most important cause of peptic ulcer disease and its eradication cures the disease. There are still unanswered questions regarding varying sequelae of Helicobacter pylori infection, the effect of the infection on gastric acid and gastrin secretion while a convenient and effective treatment regime remains to be developed. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are now thought to be the second most important cause of peptic ulcer disease and a major risk factor for ulcer complications and mortality. While misoprostol and histamine H-2 antagonists can prevent peptic ulcer associated with these substances, indications for prophylaxis have not yet been defined. If Helicobacter pylori infection could be controlled through improved socio-economic standards and possible development of a vaccine, and if anti-inflammatory drugs devoid of gastric side effects can be developed, peptic ulcer may become a less important health problem in the future.",E,E

This method, however, is not generally available.; To determine whether gastroesophageal reflux disease can be diagnosed empirically by acid suppression in patients with normal results of endoscopy.; We studied 33 consecutive outpatients with pathologic findings on pH monitoring who had symptoms compatible with gastroesophageal reflux disease and normal results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, particularly a normal appearance of the esophageal mucosa. The severity of symptoms was graded on a visual analog scale from 1 to 10 by the patient. The patients were treated for at least 7 days with either ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily (patients 1 through 10), omeprazole, 40 mg/d (patients 11 through 21), or omeprazole, 40 mg twice daily (patients 22 through 33). A reassessment of symptoms and second pH monitoring were performed during the last day of treatment.; Omeprazole, 40 mg/d, significantly reduced the severity of symptoms from 7.1 (range, 4 to 9) to 3.7 (0 to 8) and the reflux measure mean acidity from 0.98 mmol/L (0.21 to 76 mmol/L) to 0.02 mmol/L (0 to 0.47 mmol/L). Omeprazole, 40 mg twice daily, significantly reduced the severity of symptoms from 6.8 (3 to 10) to 0.6 (0 to 2) and the mean acidity from 0.38 mmol/L (0.13 to 8.5 mmol/L) to 0.01 mmol/L (0 to 0.14 mmol/L). Both doses of omeprazole were superior to ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily. When a 75% reduction of symptoms was defined as positive, the ""omeprazole test"" with 40 mg twice daily had a sensitivity of 83.3%, whereas the sensitivity with 40 mg/d was only 27.2%.; In practice, the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease can be ruled out if symptoms do not improve with a limited course of high-dose proton pump inhibitors.",I,E

This allowed us to delineate more accurately the patient population that is likely to respond to long-term continuous treatment with low or standard dose cisapride. The analysis revealed that symptom severity may be more useful than endoscopic severity in predicting relapse or in guiding therapy. Reflux oesophagitis outcome is particularly poor in the presence of treatment-recalcitrant symptoms or severe mucosal damage. Analysis showed cisapride to be effective in the maintenance treatment of patients with non-refractory symptoms, irrespective of the initial severity of oesophagitis, the healing agent used, or a history of previous endoscopic relapses.",E,E

Healing with omeprazole is often followed by early relapse. Combination treatment and subsequent maintenance treatment with the prokinetic cisapride may be of benefit in relapse prevention.; Patients with endoscopically proven oesophagitis, grade I (n = 120) or grade II (n = 105), were randomized in an open fashion to receive 8 weeks of healing treatment with omeprazole 20 mg daily (OM) followed by 12 months of follow-up without maintenance treatment, or 8 weeks of combined treatment of omeprazole 20 mg daily plus cisapride 5 mg t.d.s. (OMCIS) followed by 12 months of maintenance treatment with cisapride 5 mg t.d.s. (CIS). Only the patients healed after acute treatment were included in the 12-month follow-up study for evaluation of endoscopic relapse.; In the group of patients with oesophagitis grade I (n = 58 receiving OM, n = 62 receiving OMCIS), healing rates were comparable for both acute treatment regimens. In the group of patients with grade II (n = 54 receiving OM, n = 51 receiving OMCIS), the healing rates were slightly but not significantly in favour of OMCIS after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. During the 12 months of follow-up, CIS maintenance treatment was associated with a significant reduction of relapse. In the group of patients with initial grade I oesophagitis, the relapse rates after 3 months were 20% in the OMCIS group receiving CIS maintenance treatment, compared to 48% in the group healed on OM without further maintenance treatment (P = 0.04). After 6 months, these relapse rates were 31% and 85% respectively (P < 0.001), and after 12 months 40% and 96% (P < 0.001). In the group of patients with initial grade II oesophagitis, they were, respectively, 20% vs. 39% after 3 months (P = 0.056), 41% vs. 78% after 6 months (P < 0.001) and 52% vs. 95% after 12 months (P < 0.001).; The results of this open study indicate that continued treatment with cisapride 5 mg t.d.s. (after initial healing with omeprazole 20 mg daily plus cisapride 5 mg t.d.s.) is beneficial in the long-term management of grade I and II oesophagitis: this treatment approach significantly reduces the high relapse rate observed after stopping healing treatment with omeprazole.",I,E

During the 2-year follow-up period endoscopy including histological examination was performed after 1 and 2 years or whenever symptoms compatible with ulcer relapse occurred. HP eradication was achieved in 82% of the OME + AMX group, but in 0% of the OME group. The cumulative DU relapse rates were 0% after 1 year and 7% after 2 years in 22 patients who became HP-negative. Both HP-negative patients who relapsed in the 2nd year of follow-up were HP-positive again at the time of relapse. Of the 5 patients who were not eradicated after OME + AMX therapy, 2 relapsed within the 1st year (40%) and another 2 within the 2nd year (80%). In the OME group the cumulative relapse rates within 1 and 2 years of follow-up were 52 and 76%, respectively.

NSAIDs reduce endogenous prostaglandins, and this reduction is relevant to their pharmacology and toxicity. The stomach and to some extent the duodenum are the major organs involved in the mucosal toxicity of NSAIDs. With the availability of the synthetic prostaglandin misoprostol, it has become possible to prevent NSAID-induced gastroduodenal ulcers without compromising the beneficial antirheumatic and analgesic effects of NSAID therapy. In fact, misoprostol is the only drug with established long-term efficacy in preventing NSAID-induced gastroduodenal ulcers in rheumatic patients. The purpose of this communication is to critically review the efficacy of gastric antisecretory drugs, mucosal protective drugs and misoprostol when used for the prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers, considering only data from well-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical studies. The histamine H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine has been shown to be effective in preventing NSAID-induced duodenal ulcers, but has no efficacy in preventing NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. In a direct comparative trial with ranitidine, misoprostol (200 micrograms qid) was significantly more effective than ranitidine (150 mg bid) in preventing gastric ulcers in chronic NSAID users. The inactivity of ranitidine in preventing gastric ulcers indicates that the pathogenesis of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers is not related to gastric acid. Limited but conflicting data exist with omeprazole. The mucosal-coating drug sucralfate has not been found effective in preventing NSAID ulcers. In fact, in a direct comparative trial, misoprostol (200 micrograms qid) was significantly more effective than sucralfate (1 g qid) in preventing gastric ulcers in patients receiving chronic NSAID therapy. No meaningful data exist with organic bismuth salts, a group of drugs which has mucosal coating and protective properties. From this brief overview, we conclude: (1) mucosal-coating compounds have no therapeutic role in preventing NSAID-induced ulceration; (2) gastric antisecretory drugs are not effective in preventing NSAID-induced gastric ulcers, and (3) misoprostol is the only antiulcer drug proven to be effective for preventing NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients receiving chronic NSAID. Misoprostol represents a major therapeutic advance for the management of NSAID-induced mucosal injury.",E,E

No maintenance antiulcer therapy was given. Patients underwent a second endoscopy 4 weeks after completion of therapy and were followed for 1 year. Endoscopy was performed again at the end of 1 year. All patients showed ulcer healing 4 weeks after completion of therapy. H. pylori eradication rates were 83% (Group A) and 5% (Group B) (p < .001). Ulcer recurrences were significantly lower in Group A (3/29 or 10%) than in Group B (9/22 or 41%; p < .05). Comparison of Group A patients with eradication and Group B patients without eradication also revealed a significant difference in rates of ulcer relapse (1/24 or 4% versus 9/21 or 43%; p < .01). Rebleeding occurred significantly less often in the dual therapy group than in the omeprazole group (0/29 versus 6/22 or 27%; p < .01). Eradication of H. pylori significantly reduces the rates of ulcer recurrence and rebleeding in patients with duodenal ulcer bleeding. Dual therapy with omeprazole and amoxicillin should be considered in all H. pylori-positive patients with hemorrhage from duodenal ulcers.",E,E

Ulcers in the stomach and duodenum are typically secondary to systemic illnesses or drugs in young children; secondary ulcers do not recur. In contrast, duodenal ulcers in older children and adolescents have a relapsing course that is increasingly recognized to be related to coexisting, chronic, active antral gastritis and Helicobacter pylori infection. Antihelicobacter therapy not only heals duodenal ulcers, but it alters the natural history by reducing the frequency of ulcer recurrences. Not all primary duodenal or gastric ulcers in the pediatric population, however, are related to H. pylori; their cause remains unknown. Treatment for these patients requires either antacids, H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, or ulcer coating agents for 6-8 weeks along with long-term maintenance therapy.",E,E

Complete healing was achieved after 4 and 8 weeks of therapy (protocol-correct) in 69 and 82% (pantoprazole) and 57 and 67% (ranitidine), respectively (p = 0.054 at 4 weeks and p < 0.01 at 8 weeks). The predominant symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, i.e., heartburn and acid eructation, were more effectively reduced in pantoprazole- than in ranitidine-treated patients. The frequency of adverse events was low and did not differ between the two treatment groups. We conclude that pantoprazole is superior to ranitidine in the acute treatment of reflux esophagitis.",I,I

We studied the efficacy of antibacterial therapy without medication to suppress gastric acid for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and gastric ulcers unrelated to the use of nonsteroidal agents.; Patients with gastric ulcers seen on endoscopy and with H. pylori infection confirmed by smear or culture were randomly assigned to receive either a one-week course of antibacterial agents (120 mg of bismuth subcitrate, 500 mg of tetracycline, and 400 mg of metronidazole, each given orally four times a day) or a four-week course of omeprazole (20 mg orally per day). Follow-up endoscopies were performed after five and nine weeks. The patients and their physicians were aware of the treatment assignments, but the endoscopists were not.; A total of 100 patients were randomly assigned to treatment, and 85 completed the trial. At five weeks, H. pylori had been eradicated in 41 of the 45 patients in the antibacterial-treatment group (91.1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 82.9 to 99.3) and in 5 of the 40 in the omeprazole group (12.5 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 22.7; P < 0.001). The gastric ulcers were healed in 38 of the patients treated with antibacterial drugs (84.4 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 73.9 to 95.0) and in 29 of those treated with omeprazole (72.5 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 58.6 to 86.4; P = 0.28). At nine weeks, ulcer healing was confirmed in 43 of the patients receiving antibacterial therapy and in 37 of those receiving omeprazole (P = 1.0). The mean (+/- SD) duration of pain during the first week of treatment was 1.9 +/- 2.6 days in the omeprazole group, as compared with 3.6 +/- 3.0 days in the antibacterial-treatment group (P = 0.004). One year after treatment, recurrent gastric ulcers were detected in 1 of 22 patients (4.5 percent) in the antibacterial-treatment group and in 12 of 23 (52.2 percent) in the omeprazole group (P = 0.001). H. pylori was detected in the 1 patient with a recurrent ulcer who had received antibacterial treatment and in 10 of the 12 patients with recurrent ulcers who had received omeprazole.; In patients with H. pylori infection and gastric ulcers unrelated to the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, one week of antibacterial therapy without acid suppression heals the ulcers as well as omeprazole and reduces the rate of their recurrence.",E,E

One group received psychotherapy; one group was a control group. One hundred patients, aged 17 to 64 years, with duodenal ulcer were selected from March 1989 to May 1991. The main outcome measure was relapse of duodenal ulcer, which was verified by endoscopy. When psychotherapy started after cessation of antiulcer medication, the relapse-free time was significantly shorter in the therapy group than in the controls. When the protocol was modified so that psychotherapy and antiulcer medication were given concomitantly, there was no significant difference in recurrence rate between the groups at 1-year follow-up (84% in the therapy group and 92% in the control group). Symptoms of upper abdominal discomfort/pain, measured every second month, decreased significantly in the therapy group compared to the control group. Psychotherapy led to less neuroticism (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire) and less trait anxiety (Spielberger Trait Anxiety Scale) compared to controls at 4 months. At the 12-month follow-up, most of this gain was lost, but the psychotherapy group had lower scores on ""concern about disapproval"" on the Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale than the control group. There is no beneficial effect of short-term cognitive psychotherapy on the 1-year recurrence rate of duodenal ulcer.",E,E

Ulcer healing was endoscopically confirmed in all but one patient in the second group.; For the first time a promising concept for H. pylori eradication in H. pylori-positive ulcer bleeding is available by using a combined intravenous and oral omeprazole/amoxicillin therapy, which can be started intravenously immediately after an emergency upper GI endoscopy. In addition, these data imply that omeprazole pretreatment may not be wise when H. pylori eradication is attempted.",E,E

Age greater than 60 years, a prior history of ulcer disease, and concomitant corticosteroid use are important risk factors for ulcer development. NSAIDs interfere with mucosal defense via direct toxic effects in addition to cyclooxygenase inhibition and subsequent depletion of endogenous prostaglandins. While all NSAIDs are ulcerogenic, drugs which avoid topical injury and do not inhibit mucosal prostaglandins appear to have lesser risk of toxicity. Although NSAID injury requires luminal acid, prophylactic use of H2 receptor antagonists has been disappointing, preventing duodenal injury only. Greater acid suppression with proton pump inhibition appears promising. Prostaglandins are effective for prevention of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal injury, but are not well tolerated. Recent evidence suggests NSAID ulcers heal rapidly with proton pump inhibitors compared to H2 receptor antagonists in those patients who require continued NSAID therapy.",E,E

It could be due to an imbalance between acid secretion and mucosal defensive and/or protective mechanisms, but the association between Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulceration has questioned this hypothesis. Therefore, drugs inhibiting acid secretion and/or eradicating H. pylori are of major interest. Peptic ulcer disease is often associated with renal failure. For the selection of the proper dosage of these agents their pharmacokinetic properties and alterations in pharmacokinetics in various disease states, including renal failure, should be known. As histamine H2-receptor antagonists and pirenzepine are mainly eliminated by the renal route their elimination is dependent on creatinine clearance. Consequently, their elimination will be impaired in patients with renal insufficiency, which makes dosage reduction mandatory in these patients. No dosage supplementation is necessary after any type of dialysis because the drugs are removed in insignificant amounts by the various blood purification procedures. Misoprostol and proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole, are primarily eliminated by nonrenal routes. Therefore no dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with renal insufficiency. Bismuth salts, sucralfate and antacids should be avoided in patients with renal failure because of the accumulation of their cations and the associated risk of toxic reactions. For most agents more long term experience from comparative and double-blinded studies is needed to define better their clinical efficacy and tolerability in patients with renal failure.",E,E

We sought to examine histologic differences in healing induced by omeprazole and nizatidine. This also entailed assessing interobserver variation in endoscopic diagnosis and the correlation between endoscopic and histomorphologic healing. We treated 31 DU patients for 4 weeks with either omeprazole (20 mg daily a.m.) or nizatidine (300 mg twice daily). The healing rates of both groups showed no significant differences (86.7% versus 81.2%; p = 0.5). Good mucosal repair rates did not differ significantly (38.5% versus 69.2% respectively; p = 0.5). Endoscopists' agreement over scar type was 0.80, with the chance of agreement 0.70 (k = 0.34 +/- -0.08). The correlation between macroscopic and histologic appearance of scars was fair, but fully significant (r = 0.48; p < 0.05). We conclude that the study was too small to detect significant differences in healing patterns between the two drugs.

One hundred untreated adults with biopsy-proven CS, 52 healthy controls, and 57 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, lymphoma of the small bowel, Whipple's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome were investigated. Only JAB and EmA were detected at a similar titer in all patients with untreated CS but in no controls (100% sensitivity and specificity). Sensitivity of AGA was, respectively, 55% for IgA and 78% for Ig class, with a 100 and 82% specificity. The differences in frequencies between both EmA and JAB with IgA and IgG AGA were highly significant. We conclude that JAB and EmA provide a reliable noninvasive screening test for clinically significant gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The lower cost of IgA-JAB is a major advantage, owing to the different availability of the lower third of the esophagus and jejunum from primates. The sensitivity and specificity of the two tests are almost identical, but we find interpreting EmA easier than JAB especially when the titer is low.",I,I

At the single doses of 20 and 40 mg, intragastric pH was continuously monitored in each of two subjects. No abnormal findings definitely attributable to the test drug were observed throughout the study. In the single-dose study, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of TY-11345 increased in a dose-proportional manner. The time to reach Cmax was about 3 h after dosing and plasma concentrations declined thereafter with a half-life of about 1 h irrespective of dose. The effect of food intake on the pharmacokinetic parameters of TY-11345, which was evaluated at the dose of 40 mg in a cross-over design, was not significant. TY-11345 was not detected in urine unchanged, while a main metabolite and its conjugate were identified in urine as 32-38% of the dose. An intragastric pH value over 4 was obtained about 3 h after the administration of 40 mg and maintained for more than 5 h, despite the fall of plasma concentration. This effect was less obvious at a dose of 20 mg. In the multiple-dose study, the pharmacokinetics exhibited no substantial difference between the first and last doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

The present prospective, randomized study was designed to compared the efficacy and safety of amoxicillin and clarithromycin as constituents of omeprazole-enhanced antibiotic therapy of H. pylori infection. Fifty patients with active duodenal ulcer disease and histologically and/or culturally confirmed H. pylori colonization of the gastric mucosa were treated with omeprazole (day 1-14: 40 mg twice daily, day 15-42: 20 mg once in the morning). The patients were randomly assigned to receive either amoxicillin (1 g twice daily; group I: n = 25) or clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily; group II: n = 25) during the first 2 weeks of treatment. The patients of group I and II had comparable demographic and clinical characteristics. One patient of group I was lost to follow-up. H. pylori infection was cured in 87.5% of group I and 84.0% of group II (p = 1.00). All ulcers had healed after 6 weeks of omeprazole treatment. Pain relief occurred within the first day of treatment in the majority of patients of both groups (p = 0.89). Minor side effects were recorded in 6 patients of group I and in 4 patients of group II (25 vs. 16%; p = 0.50). In 1 female patient amoxicillin had to be withdrawn after 3 days because of nausea and emesis.

The pH was monitored over 24-hour periods during fasting in a cross-over, randomised design including a baseline period. With the high omeprazole dose it was possible to maintain a pH > or = 4 in all patients but 1 and 6 of the patients also maintained a pH > or = 6. The lower dose of omeprazole seemed to be somewhat less effective. Continuous infusion of ranitidine was as efficient as the higher omeprazole infusion although with a tendency to decreased pH levels towards the end of the 24-hour period. Thus, in order to obtain consistently high pH levels of 4-6 over a prolonged period a continuous infusion of omeprazole, an 80-mg bolus plus a continuous infusion of 8 mg/h seem to be needed.",E,E

Patients in the omeprazole-treated group were pretreated with 3 days of omeprazole. Eradication of H pylori was assessed by 10 endoscopic biopsies for urease test, histology, and culture 4-6 weeks after treatment. 53 of 54 (98.1%) patients treated with omeprazole were cured compared with 45 of 54 (83.3%) of those not treated (p = 0.02), a difference in efficacy of 14.8% (95% Cl 4.2-25.4%).

Antisecretory agents lower the acidity of the refluxate, thus decreasing its aggressive effect, which favors the mucosal healing process. The greater the acid inhibition, the greater will be the mucosal repair. This is the reason for a therapeutic gain for H2-receptor antagonists over anticholinergics and antacids, and for proton pump inhibitors over H2-receptor antagonists. The most recently developed proton pump inhibitor, lansoprazole, at doses of 15, 30, or 60 mg/day for 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, has proven to be significantly more effective than placebo (one multicenter study involving 292 patients) or ranitidine (three multicenter studies involving 653 patients) in terms of mucosal healing and symptom relief. In two comparative trials with omeprazole 20 mg vs lansoprazole 30 mg (in a total of 349 evaluable patients) healing rates were found to be similar, but in one trial the relief of heartburn proved to be significantly more pronounced in patients receiving lansoprazole who also used fewer antacids. The frequency of adverse events was comparable in the two treatment groups. Reflux esophagitis is a chronic condition and after stopping antisecretory treatment, including lansoprazole, most patients relapse in terms of symptoms and endoscopical lesions, which suggests the need for long-term treatment. However, a strategy for long-term control of reflux esophagitis remains to be defined (lower daily dose, alternate-day standard dose, or concomitant prokinetic drugs?). The safety of proton pump inhibitors given for prolonged periods also needs to be more thoroughly evaluated.",E,E

Recent studies have suggested that the eradication of H. pylori affects the natural history of duodenal ulcer disease such that the rate of relapse decreases markedly. We evaluated the relationship between H. pylori infection and peptic ulcer relapse in a Japanese population following a prospective study. Seven of 18 (38.9%) gastric ulcer patients positive for H. pylori relapsed by the end of 1 year, whereas only 1 of 9 (11.1%) gastric ulcer patients without H. pylori developed ulcer relapse (P < 0.05). Relapse rates of duodenal ulcer patients negative for H. pylori were significantly lower than those positive for H. pylori within 1 year (0% vs 66.7%; P < 0.01).

Although ulcer recurrence and complications can be prevented, many patients with peptic ulcer disease fail to receive the benefits of modern therapeutic regimens. In recent years, eradication of Helicobactor pylori has been promoted as a 'cure' for peptic ulcer disease and, while such claims are premature, there can be little doubt that this treatment--when successful--dramatically improves the medium-term prognosis of ulcer patients. However, in general, clinicians have given this promising therapeutic advance a lukewarm welcome. The aim of this detailed review of the literature is to remove the uncertainty and confusion surrounding many aspects of eradication therapy. Estimates are provided of the eradication rates after either triple therapy or the combination of omeprazole plus amoxycillin, and the sources of variation in published studies are discussed. Problems associated with eradication therapy, including side effects, compliance and re-infection, are addressed in order to ascertain the extent and clinical significance of each factor. In addition, studies reporting the outcome of patients with peptic ulcer disease after eradication are assessed with reference to both ulcer recurrence and complications. The result of the review is to dissipate much of the scepticism concerning eradication therapy. However, whilst acknowledging the efficacy of eradication therapy, its limitations have also to be recognized. By itself, it does not provide the complete answer to peptic ulcer disease. For some ulcer patients, eradication therapy is the preferred option; for others, prophylactic therapy with H2-receptor antagonists is more suitable. Guidelines are proposed for the selection of patients for each alternative therapy. The crucial point is that patients with peptic ulcer--excluding the small proportion with a mild form of the disease--require positive, long-term management consisting of either continuous prophylaxis with H2-receptor antagonists or the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.",E,E

Including the other seven trials did not change the results significantly. Only 18 subjects (95% CI, 14 to 25) needed to be treated to prevent one cardiovascular event (cerebrovascular or cardiac). Twelve trials in primarily younger and middle-aged adults involved approximately 33,000 persons.

In 65 out of 73 patients with duodenal ulcer who could be followed up, H. pylori was eradicated using a combination of amoxycillin, 3 g daily, metronidazole, 1 g daily, and omeprazole, 20 mg daily. Rapid and permanent (6-month follow-up) abolition of both gastroduodenitis activity and lesions of the gastric surface epithelium was observed in these 65 patients. There was also a progressive decrease in total immune-inflammatory cells but without a substantial change in duodenal gastric-type metaplasia. Similar, but transient and quantitatively less prominent, improvements were observed in the antroduodenal mucosa, which had been temporarily cleared of H. pylori by treatment with omeprazole alone. Conversely, increased gastritis activity, epithelial lesions and immune-inflammatory cell scores were found in the short term in the corpus mucosa, which was not cleared of H. pylori after omeprazole treatment. It is concluded that, of the various H. pylori-related mucosal changes, antroduodenitis activity and antral epithelial lesions most closely reflect the severity of mucosal damage and are probably the most important factors in duodenal ulcerogenesis.

However, the relapse rate can be effectively reduced by inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Although many patients can be managed with episodic therapy, controlled either by the patient or doctor, continuous maintenance treatment is often necessary for patients with severe forms of the disease and those at risk of complications (2). Maintenance therapy with single night-time doses of an H2-receptor antagonist reduces relapse rates from approximately 75% to 25% per year (3). As omeprazole is more effective than the H2-receptor antagonists in the acute treatment of duodenal ulcer, healing virtually all patients within 4 weeks (4), it may also be more effective in the maintenance treatment of duodenal ulcer disease. To date, three studies have reported the effect of omeprazole on relapse rates of duodenal ulcer. A Danish multicentre study involved 195 patients, who were treated with omeprazole, either 10 mg once daily, or 20 mg once daily on Friday, Saturday and Sunday (weekend therapy), or with placebo (5). After 6 months, the remission rates were 67% and 70%, respectively, for those patients receiving omeprazole--significantly higher than in those receiving placebo (17% after 6 months). An Italian multicentre study of 81 patients found that omeprazole, both 10 mg once daily, and 20 mg once daily at weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday), was equally effective in preventing relapse.

However, with regard to symptom severity, patients without macroscopic mucosal lesions have been shown not to differ from those with more severe oesophagitis. A number of controlled trials on the efficacy of omeprazole in GORD have included patients with lower grades of the disease. The results show that the differences in efficacy between omeprazole and H2-receptor antagonists, which have been established for the treatment of erosive and ulcerative oesophagitis, also extend to patients with grade I oesophagitis (erythema and friability). In these studies, omeprazole provided more rapid symptom resolution and histological improvement than ranitidine. In one double-blind comparative trial, complete endoscopic normalization of the oesophageal mucosa was observed in 90% of patients with grade I oesophagitis within 4 weeks of treatment with omeprazole, 40 mg once daily, compared with 55% of those treated with ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily; at 8 weeks the mucosa in all patients in the omeprazole group had completely healed at endoscopy, while oesophagitis was still present in 21% of the patients receiving ranitidine.

In patients with reflux oesophagitis, treatment with the acid pump inhibitor, omeprazole, has repeatedly been demonstrated to prevent the recurrence of symptoms and of erosive and/or ulcerative lesions in the oesophagus. Comparative trials have shown that an average of 82% of oesophagitis patients were maintained in endoscopic and symptomatic remission over a period of 12 months when treated with omeprazole, 20 mg once daily. This compares with only 36% of patients in remission when given 'full-dose' H2-receptor antagonist therapy (ranitidine, 300 mg daily). It is interesting to note that, in a recent trial, 62% of reflux oesophagitis patients were in remission after 12 months of treatment with omeprazole, 10 mg once daily, compared with the corresponding figure of 72% among those on 20 mg once daily. In patients poorly responsive to control of oesophagitis with H2-receptor antagonists, omeprazole at a dose of at least 20 mg daily is required to achieve symptom resolution and endoscopic healing--and remission can be maintained for years with continued omeprazole treatment.

Differences are usually made on the basis of the proportion of ulcers healed at varying time intervals. It has been shown by meta-analysis that healing of duodenal ulcers with antisecretory drugs is directly correlated to the degree of acid suppression. More recently, sophisticated meta-analysis of 24-hour intragastric acidity data and clinical trials of antisecretory drugs has demonstrated that the optimal degree and duration of gastric acid suppression for healing duodenal ulcer can be achieved by an aggregate time above pH 3 of 18-20 hours/day. These conditions predict 100% ulcer healing at 4 weeks. Antisecretory drug regimens that approach these criteria should achieve faster healing than other agents, with a concomitant acceleration of symptom resolution. Regression analysis was performed on the healing-time curves for each drug class to determine the rate of ulcer healing per week. The mean proportion of ulcers healed, irrespective of treatment duration, was highest for omeprazole, which also provided a significantly faster rate of duodenal ulcer healing than all other drug classes (p < 0.001). It has recently been shown that healing of erosive oesophagitis with antisecretory drugs is directly correlated with both the duration of acid suppression over the 24-hour period (p < 0.05) and the elevation of intra-oesophageal pH above 4. Furthermore, oesophageal acid exposure time can be normalized by maintaining the intra-oesophageal pH above 4 for at least 96% of the 24-hour period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

Patients with an active duodenal ulcer were treated until healed or for a maximum of 24 weeks. Maintenance therapy was instituted in patients with ulcers that were very slow to heal and in patients with frequent relapses after cessation of treatment. Patients who experienced frequent relapses while receiving maintenance therapy, and those whose ulcer had not healed after 24 weeks of continuous treatment, were defined as candidates for surgery. A statistical model was set up and a random number generator used to generate a sequence of clinical events, month by month, over a 5-year period for each patient in a large cohort. Episodic treatment with omeprazole was shown to be more effective in avoiding maintenance treatment and surgery when compared with episodic treatment with ranitidine.

This study was carried out to assess the pharmacodynamic properties and the possible changes with time of two dose regimens of omeprazole that could be suitable for long-term treatment in duodenal ulcer.; Twenty patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer were studied by means of 24-h gastric pH-metry both in basal conditions and on the 5th day of acute treatment with 40 mg omeprazole in the morning. All the ulcers healed after 4 weeks, and thereafter 10 patients were randomized to receive orally 20 mg omeprazole daily at 0800 h in single-blind fashion (group A) and 10 to receive 20 mg omeprazole every other day (group B) for up to 6 months. At the end of the 1st, 3rd, and 6th month of these maintenance treatments 24-h gastric pH-metry was repeated to assess the antisecretory effect of each regimen over time.

The patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy every 2 months.; Three patients in group B were lost to follow-up for various reasons, and only seven remained eligible for final analysis. The two long-term regimens of omeprazole were able to increase significantly pH values (p < 0.02-0.001) and the times spent at and above pH 3.0 (p < 0.001) over 24 h compared with basal conditions. In group A the 24-h pH value obtained in the 6th month was higher (p < 0.02) than that in the 3rd month of maintenance treatment. In group B the pharmacologic effect tended to decrease on the day without medication compared with the day with medication, but the difference between them was significantly (p < 0.05) only at the 6-month interval.

However, long-term follow-up data on the overall efficacy and safety of these agents in large numbers of patients are lacking. In the current study we examined the long-term efficacy and safety of omeprazole in 116 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated with oral omeprazole at a single centre for up to 114 months (mean +/- S.E.M. = 38 +/- 3 months). The initial omeprazole maintenance dose was established according to the acute upward dose titration method in 89/116 patients (77%). Gastric acid output was effectively controlled using 60 mg of omeprazole once daily in 41/89 patients (46%) and 22/89 patients (25%) required twice daily omeprazole therapy. The mean ranitidine equivalent dose for patients who required 60 mg omeprazole once daily (2.5 +/- 0.2 g/day) was significantly lower than the mean ranitidine equivalent dose for patients who required more than 60 mg omeprazole once daily (4.3 +/- 0.3 g/day). Long-term omeprazole maintenance therapy was discontinued in 36/116 patients (31%) but in no cases was discontinuation due either to drug-induced side-effects or uncontrolled gastric acid output. Fasting serum gastrin levels were significantly elevated above pre-treatment levels at only one time point during follow-up and were likely due to tumour growth rather than a drug effect. The final long-term omeprazole maintenance doses were lower than the initial doses but correlated closely with the pre-omeprazole basal acid output (r = 0.41, P < 0.001) and ranitidine equivalent dose requirements (r = 0.49, P < 0.001). We conclude that omeprazole effectively and safely controls gastric acid hypersecretion in all patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome for up to nine years without evidence by tachyphylaxis.",E,E

One patient intolerant of omeprazole underwent fundoplication and was asymptomatic 6 weeks after surgery. Only 3 patients had esophagitis at entry.; The signs and symptoms of posterior laryngitis improve with the administration of omeprazole and symptoms recur after discontinuation of therapy, suggesting that reflux is the underlying etiology. Patients with refractory symptoms, but intolerant of omeprazole, may benefit from antireflux surgery.

The aim of this study was to find out if the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (20 mg daily) is associated with increased concentrations of potentially carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds in gastric juice. The volume of gastric contents, number of bacteria, and concentrations of nitrates, nitrites, and N-nitroso compounds was determined in gastric aspirates obtained after an overnight fast in 14 healthy volunteers (7M:7F) after one week of treatment with placebo, and one and two weeks' treatment with omeprazole. Median bacterial concentrations were 1.0 x 10(4) (range 5.0 x 10(3)-5.0 x 10(6)) colony forming units (CFU)/ml after one weeks' treatment with placebo and increased significantly to 4.0 x 10(5) (0-3.3 x 10(7)) CFU/ml after two weeks' treatment with omeprazole (p < 0.05). A similar increase was seen in the concentration of nitrate reducing bacteria. There was no difference in the volume of gastric aspirates after treatment with omeprazole when compared with placebo (65 (29-155) ml v 42 (19-194) ml). The concentration of N-nitroso compounds was 0.13 (0-1.0) mumol/l after two weeks of omeprazole, which was not significantly different from that seen with placebo (0.15 (0-0.61) mumol/l). There was also no increase in the concentrations of nitrates or nitrites. It is concluded that omeprazole (20 mg once daily) for two weeks in healthy volunteers is associated with gastric bacterial proliferation but does not increase concentrations of N-nitroso compounds.",E,E

In just one patient with severe oesophagitis, the lesion took more than 6 months to heal. After ulcer healing, patients (98 to date) were treated with pantoprazole (40 mg/day) as long-term maintenance therapy. Eighty-eight of the 98 patients have been taking pantoprazole for 6 months to 3 years. During maintenance therapy, peptic disease was kept in remission in most patients with 40 mg pantoprazole. Twelve patients with oesophagitis and two patients with gastric ulcers needed higher doses (80-120 mg) to control the disease. One female patient developed peripheral oedema which disappeared quickly after stopping treatment. No further drug-related adverse effects were observed. Seven patients withdrew from the study and two patients died, all for non-drug-related reasons. Routine laboratory tests remained without significant changes in all patients. Mean (+/- S.E.M.) serum gastrin levels were already elevated during the initial high-dose ranitidine treatment (128 +/- 23 pg/ml).

Misoprostol is of equal efficacy to H2 antagonists in the healing of ordinary peptic ulcers (not associated with NSAIDs). Misoprostol is superior to placebo in healing NSAID ulcers during continued NSAID treatment but there have been no comparative trials with other ulcer-healing drugs.

Patients were assessed for relapse by endoscopy (with gastric biopsy) at six and 12 months, or in the event of symptomatic recurrence, and serum gastrin was monitored. At 12 months, the estimated proportions of patients in remission (actuarial life table method) were 89% when receiving daily omeprazole compared with 32% when receiving weekend omeprazole (difference 57%, p < 0.001, 95% confidence intervals: 42% to 71%) and 25% when receiving daily ranitidine (difference 64%, p < 0.001, 95% confidence intervals: 50% to 78%).

Data have now been accumulated on lansoprazole treatment of 41 patients (21 treated at the National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, Maryland, USA, and 20 treated at the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris, France). Short-term studies of the inhibitory action of lansoprazole on acid secretion have been carried out in both institutions. Our group first performed a dose-response analysis of the efficacy of lansoprazole in reducing basal acid output (BAO) in four patients with severe Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (mean BAO 52 +/- 9 [SD] mmol H+/h) who had previously been treated with a mean omeprazole dosage of 75 mg/day. The maximum acid inhibitory effect was obtained with lansoprazole 60-90 mg/day. The 40-hour duration of action of lansoprazole appears equivalent to that of omeprazole. In a second study at the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, nine Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients underwent 24-hour intragastric pH monitoring while receiving lansoprazole (mean dosage 80 mg/day, range 30-165 mg/day) or omeprazole (mean dosage 75 mg/day, range 20-180 mg/day). The acid inhibitory activity of the two drugs was comparable. Those patients are currently receiving long-term maintenance treatment with lansoprazole, and satisfactory clinical and biological secretory control has been achieved. The long-term safety and efficacy of lansoprazole administration were studied in the 21 patients followed at the NIH. In those patients the initial maintenance dose was determined using acid inhibition studies; in all patients lansoprazole controlled gastric acid hypersecretion and peptic symptoms in both the short and long term. The mean initial maintenance dose was 60 mg QID, except for two patients who required 60 mg BID. During long-term treatment (mean duration 31 months, range 1-43 months), six patients required a dosage increase within the first year, while the lansoprazole dose could be reduced in six others. The safety profile of lansoprazole has been excellent. Comparable results have been noted in nine Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients during an ongoing evaluation in our institution.

Eradication of H pylori is associated with a highly significant decline in the recurrence rates of DU, indicating that treatments aimed at eradicating H pylori are mandatory in these patients. The novel proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole exhibits a potent antiulcer effect and, in vitro, a direct antibacterial effect against H pylori. Conflicting data have been reported on the question of whether lansoprazole is bactericidal against H pylori in vivo when administered alone. The aim of this double-blind trial was to address this issue further by comparing the effects of two different 4-week regimens (lansoprazole alone or in combination with amoxicillin) on H pylori infection in patients with DU. Patients were assessed before and after the 4-week treatment and 3 months after stopping the study medication. The ulcer healing rates at 4 weeks were similar for the two treatments while there was a trend for higher recurrence rates at 4 months in patients receiving lansoprazole alone. The frequency of high-grade H pylori infection was significantly lower in the lansoprazole and amoxicillin group both at 4 weeks (84% clearing) and 4 months. After 4 weeks of treatment there were no patients with residual H pylori-positive active antral gastritis in the lansoprazole and amoxicillin group compared with 25% in the lansoprazole alone group.

There are few data concerning the role of anti-H pylori treatment in gastric ulcer disease. A total of 83 patients presenting with H pylori positive active gastric ulcer disease were treated with omeprazole and antibiotics (amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, roxithromycin) in seven different clinical protocols, each of which included the attempt to eradicate H pylori infection and to evaluate the post-therapeutic course of ulcer disease. The overall proportion of H pylori eradication was 67.9% (53 of 78 patients available for follow up). Best results were obtained with two week treatment regimens comprising omeprazole 20 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 500 mg four times a day or 1000 mg twice daily (eradication > 80%). Eradication of H pylori speeds up ulcer healing, with a six week healing rate of 84.9% compared with 60% in patients with persistent H pylori infection (p = 0.0148). In a subgroup of 11 patients with refractory ulcers, H pylori eradication (n = 10) was associated with ulcer healing on continued acid suppression in nine cases. One male patient with chronic antral ulcer did not respond to treatment within the next six months (H pylori and ulcer persistence), and in one female patient a resistant body ulcer was identified as gastric lymphoma. Fifty patients with healed ulcers were followed up for one year. Patients with (n = 32) and without (n = 18) bacterial eradication had similar demographic and clinical characteristics. H pylori eradication was associated with a statistically significant reduction of ulcer recurrences (3.1 v 55.6%, p<0.001). This study concludes that H pylori eradication considerably changes the natural history of H pylori associated gastric ulcer disease. In addition, H pylori eradication speeds up ulcers healing and is associated with healing of previously refractory ulcers. Thus, treatment aimed at bacterial eradication should be considered in all patients with gastric ulcers severe enough to contemplate further treatment options.",5,E

The bacterial content of duodenal juice of patients treated with omeprazole was therefore examined in a controlled prospective study. Duodenal juice was obtained under sterile conditions during diagnostic upper endoscopy. Aspirates were plated quantitatively for anaerobic and aerobic organisms. Twenty five outpatients with peptic ulcer disease were investigated after a 5.7 (0.5) weeks (mean (SEM)) treatment course with 20 mg (nine patients) or 40 mg (16 patients). The control group consisted of 15 outpatients referred for diagnostic endoscopy without prior antisecretory treatment. No patient in the control group had duodenal bacterial overgrowth. In the omeprazole group bacterial overgrowth (> or = 10(5) cfu/ml) was found in 14 (56%) patients (p = 0.0003). The number of bacteria (log10) in duodenal juice in patients treated with omeprazole was distinctly higher (median 5.7; range < 2-8.7) when compared with the control group (median < 2; range < 2-5.0; p = 0.0004). As well as orally derived bacteria, faecal type bacteria were found in seven of 14 and anaerobic bacteria in three of 14 patients. Bacterial overgrowth was similar with the two doses of omeprazole. These results indicate that duodenal bacterial overgrowth of both oral and faecal type bacteria occurs often in ambulatory patients treated with omeprazole. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings, particularly in high risk groups during long term treatment with omeprazole.",E,E

Three of these drugs are now available (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) and more are being developed. Proton pump inhibitors share the same core structure, but differ in terms of substituents on this core. The substitutions are able to modify some important chemical properties of the compounds. For example, pantoprazole is significantly more acid-stable than omeprazole or lansoprazole. E3810 is significantly less stable than the other compounds. We present an explantation for this finding that depends on the relative pK values for the pyridine and benzimidazole nitrogens, especially the former. Pantoprazole formulated in an enteric-coated tablet displays high bioavailability and linear pharmacokinetics whether on single or multiple dose regimens. Although all three proton pump inhibitors provide a similar chemical conversion to sulphenamides, which are highly reactive cysteine reagents, these reagents derivatize different cysteines in the extracytoplasmic or membrane domain of the pump and inhibit the pump at different rates. Whereas the differences in chemical reactivity can be explained by the solution chemistry of the compounds, selective derivatization of different cysteines on the protein argues for an involvement of pump structure in response to the presence of the proton pump inhibitor on its luminal surface. This suggests that the proton pump inhibitors, which were originally designed to take advantage of only the highly acidic space generated in the parietal cell by the production of the sulphenamide, are made even more selective by the protein they target. Pantoprazole is metabolized by a combination of phase I and phase II metabolism, and has also been shown to have a very low potential for drug interaction. Studies of acid secretion in man have shown this compound to be an effective and long lasting inhibitor of acid secretion. The pharmacodynamics explain the cumulative effect of repeated doses and maximal acid secretory capacity with a once daily dosage.",I,E

Two hundred and seventy-six protocol-correct patients received either pantoprazole 40 mg (n = 185) or omeprazole 20 mg (n = 91), once daily for 2 or 4 weeks, depending on the progress of ulcer healing.; Rates of complete ulcer healing after 2 weeks were 71% in patients given pantoprazole and 74% in patients given omeprazole. After 4 weeks the figures were 96% and 91%, respectively. These differences were not significant. There was no significant difference in ulcer pain prior to treatment, and 85% of the pantoprazole group and 86% on omeprazole were pain-free after 2 weeks (not significant). The time until complete pain relief with pantoprazole or omeprazole, based on data from diary cards, was not significantly different (P > 0.05, Uleman's U-test). Both treatments were equally well tolerated. Changes in routine laboratory parameters were minimal in both groups.; Pantoprazole was shown to be a highly-effective and well-tolerated treatment for acute duodenal ulcer.

The aim of this study was to examine intrathecally administered opioid agonists against colorectal distention in conscious rabbits.; Rabbits were equipped with a subcutaneous intrathecal injection system. Colorectal distention was induced by inflation of a balloon inserted into the descending colon. The test parameter was the pressure eliciting a characteristic visceromotor response. Examinations were performed before and after administration of the following drugs: morphine, U50488H, [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE), naloxone, MR2266, naltrindole, saline, and acidified saline.; The visceromotor response to colorectal distention was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by intrathecal opioids acting as agonists at all three types of opioid receptors. Morphine was antagonized more effectively by intrathecal than intramuscular naloxone. U50488H and DPDPE were equally antagonized by the specific antagonists MR2266 and naltrindole. Electrical thresholds in the lumbar region were increased, although they remained unaltered in the cervical region after administration of all three agonists.; Intrathecal administration of different opioid agonists produces a dose-dependent spinal effect.

Subsequently, patients with healed duodenal ulcer were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: OM 20 mg once daily for 12 months, OM 20 mg alternate days for 12 months, and no treatment. Endoscopy was performed at entry, at 4 wk, and after 4, 8, and 12 months. Two biopsy specimens from antrum, body, and fundus were taken for histology and search for H. pylori. One hundred and eighty patients with active duodenal ulcer were admitted. Ninety-one were treated with OM 20 mg once daily and 89 with OM 40 mg for 4 wk.; The results at 4 wk show 92.8% patients healed with OM 20 mg and 95.1% at 40 mg (NS). In the second part of the study, 96 of the patients who healed at 4 wk (45 with OM 20 mg, and 51 with OM 40 mg) entered the long-term study. Thirty-six patients received OM 20 mg daily for 12 months, 35 OM 20 mg on alternate days for 12 months, and 25 patients no treatment. The results show a healing rate of 100%, 100%, and 95% with OM 20 mg daily, of 97%, 95%, and 93% with OM 20 mg on alternate days, and of 81%, 50%, and 40% (p < 0.01) with no treatment at 4, 8, and 12 months, respectively. H. pylori that was found in 97% of patients at entry, at 4 wk was found in 92.8% of patients treated with OM 20 mg and in 97.5% of patients treated with OM 40 mg (NS). In one-third of the patients, H. pylori disappeared from the antrum but was found in the fundus. A 30% reduction in the presence of H. pylori was seen in the group treated with 20 mg daily for 12 months.; We conclude that both continuous and alternate-day long-term OM treatment at 20 mg are similarly efficacious in the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Healing active duodenal ulcers with 20 or 40 mg does not influence subsequent treatment. Long-term OM at 20 mg daily for 12 months suppresses H. pylori temporarily in one-third of the patients. In these patients however, H. pylori reactivates after the end of treatment.",E,E

The primary objective of the present study was to elucidate the role of the duration of treatment in the cure of H. pylori infection.; Forty consecutive patients with H. pylori-positive peptic ulcer disease were randomly allocated to four study groups. The groups were treated with a 14-day course of 20 mg omeprazole b.i.d. orally combined with 2 g amoxicillin t.i.d. intravenously for 1 day (n = 10; six women, age range 40-84 yr), for 3 days (n = 10; five women, age range 29-74 yr), for 5 days (n = 10; five women, age range 21-82 yr), for 7 days (n = 10); five women, age 42-82 yr), respectively. Initially, a standardized clinical evaluation of symptoms and and upper GI tract endoscopy were performed for assessment of H. pylori infection of the gastric mucosa (biopsy urease test, specific culture, and histology). At least 4 wk after cessation of omeprazole medication, H. pylori eradication was evaluated either as described or with the help of the 13C-urea breath test.; H. pylori eradication, defined as negative bacterial findings in urease test, culture, and histology or 13C-urea breath test at least 4 wk after discontinuation of omeprazole therapy, was achieved in one of 10 patients (10%) in the one-day group, none of 10 patients (0%) in the 3- and 5-day groups and six of 10 patients (60%) in the 7-day group.; We conclude that short-term therapies with the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole and the antibiotic amoxicillin must be considered completely ineffective if performed as a short-term therapy for up to 5 days. A therapy duration of 7 days seems to mark a turning point in antibiotic effectiveness, with a rapid increase in eradication rates.",3,E

The duodenal ulcer healing rates were generally over 90% and the H. pylori eradication rates about 80% (range 59% to 100%). In one comparative study, the 4-week duodenal ulcer healing and H. pylori eradication rates of sucralfate-containing triple therapy were not distinguishable from those of omeprazole-containing triple therapy.; It is concluded that sucralfate is an effective mediating agent for the eradication of H. pylori in patients with duodenal ulcer.",E,E

The causal relationship is based on the strong association of peptic ulcer with H. pylori-induced gastritis, the improved rate of healing with H. pylori suppression, and markedly low recurrence rates for ulcer after H. pylori eradication. The ideal regimen for H. pylori eradication should be simple, inexpensive, free of side effects, and effective in at least 90% of patients. Triple therapy involving bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline or amoxicillin results in the best and most consistent eradication data, but there is a significant incidence of side effects and problems with compliance. Acid suppression with ranitidine or omeprazole combined with antibiotics is effective but expensive with variable results in clinical trials. Sucralfate may also reduce H. pylori density and enhance the action of antibiotics used in eradication regimens. Studies reported in this Journal suggest that sucralfate can be successfully substituted for bismuth in triple therapy regimens with documented efficacy and few side effects. Considerable progress in developing newer regimens to eradicate H. pylori has been made. However, the development of an ideal drug or regimen remains a challenge.",E,E

The purpose of this review was therefore to assess what conclusions could be drawn about eradication therapy, subsequent reinfection with Helicobacter pylori and ulcer recurrence.; Data were extracted from published papers and abstracts and entered into a dedicated database for appropriate subset analyses.; Despite problems of patient compliance and metronidazole resistance, triple therapy with either a bismuth salt or an antisecretory agent plus two antibiotics appears to provide the most effective eradication of H. pylori (< 80%). Dual therapies such as omeprazole plus amoxycillin are less effective (mean 59%, range 0-92%). Reinfection rates over one year vary between countries from 3% in Australia and the USA to 35% in Ireland.

Evidence for the efficacy of different regimens is often derived from small series in clinical trials but there is little reporting of everyday practice with unselected patients. Freedom from ulcer relapse has been demonstrated, but not whether this equates with clinical success.; We report on a series of 706 patients with H. pylori infection who, between January 1991 and April 1995, received eradication therapy followed by assessment of H. pylori status. Two-hundred and seven of these patients were followed-up by postal questionnaire, validated by parallel questionnaires to their general practitioners, covering clinical outcome measures.; The overall eradication rate was 81.7%, and a 1-week course of omeprazole plus two antibiotics was significantly better than a 2-week course of standard triple therapy (85.0% vs. 78.0%, P < 0.05). Amongst 21 first-time failures, a 7-day course of a clarithromycin-containing triple therapy succeeded in 18. The questionnaire replies indicate that, following successful H. pylori eradication, ulcer patients are less likely to consult with ulcer symptoms (P < 0.0005), take medication (P < 0.0005), require further prescription (P < 0.0005), or lose work-time because of their ulcer (P < 0.005). They are more likely to have a subjective sense of ulcer cure (P < 0.0005).; In addition to clear cost savings, social benefits are now demonstrated when H. pylori is eradicated. A well-tolerated 1 week regimen is genuinely effective in everyday practice.",E,E

In this randomized, prospective, open clinical trial we have compared the effects and outcome of omeprazole versus ranitidine in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer. Of 219 consecutive patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 51 (23.2%) had an ulcer with endoscopic predictors of rebleeding at the time of diagnosis. These 51 patients were selected at random to receive either omeprazole (80 mg bolus and 40 mg/12 h i.v.) or ranitidine (50 mg/4 h i.v.). No endoscopic therapy was performed at the time of diagnosis. Twenty of these patients with duodenal ulcer (n = 10 omeprazole, n = 10 ranitidine) underwent 24-h gastric pH monitoring. Both groups were homogeneous in all clinical and endoscopic parameters. No differences in blood transfusion units, time of hospitalization, the lowest hematocrit measured, and mortality rates were observed between the groups. However, omeprazole reduced the number of rebleeding episodes (p = 0.1) and the need for surgery (3.8% vs. 22.7%; p = 0.05). Omeprazole also reduced the amount of time the gastric pH was < 6 (15.3 +/- 5.9% vs. 61.8 +/- 5.6%, p < 0.0001).

The meta-analysis included a quality assessment for each trial. The main criterion chosen for the meta-analysis was the endoscopic healing rate at 4 weeks; other criteria were the healing rate at 2 weeks and the absence of pain at 2 and 4 weeks. Statistical methods used were the Der Simonian and Laird method and the method of Peto et al. A sensitivity analysis was performed according to the H2 blocker type (famotidine or ranitidine). Odds ratios against histamine-receptor blockers were used to compare lansoprazole indirectly with omeprazole and other drugs.; Five double-blind trials were identified including 848 patients. The mean 4-week healing rate in patients treated with lansoprazole was 85%, which was significantly higher than the healing rate in patients treated with H2-receptor blockers (75%).

The precise regimen that should be used for eradication of the infection remains uncertain because of the variety of regimens described, variable results with the regimens, and difficulties in predicting drug compliance outside clinical trials.; A decision analysis tree was developed with three regimens that are widely used regimens for the eradication of H. pylori: 1) 2-wk triple drug therapy (metronidazole, bismuth, tetracycline with H2 receptor antagonist), 2) 2-wk omeprazole and amoxicillin, and 3) 2-wk omeprazole and clarithromycin. Traditional H2 receptor antagonist therapy was used for comparison. A 2-yr time period was chosen for study to allow sufficient time for relapse and to evaluate its effect on the treatment strategy. Probabilities for eradication, compliance, and metronidazole resistance were determined from published data, and assumptions were tested by sensitivity analysis.; Standard 2-wk triple drug therapy was the least expensive strategy ($720), and conventional H2 receptor antagonist therapy was the most expensive ($1791). Costs with 2-wk therapy with omeprazole and clarithromycin ($768) were lower than with omeprazole and amoxicillin ($1028).; Treatment to eradicate H. pylori in infected patients with duodenal ulcer is a less expensive strategy than traditional therapy with H2 receptor antagonists. Triple drug therapy is the optimal regimen in areas where metronidazole resistance rates are < 36% and compliance is > 53%. Omeprazole and amoxicillin is not cost-effective unless eradication rates are greater than 74%.

We compared the effects of two proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), lansoprazole and omeprazole, and an H2 blocker, ranitidine, on gastric secretion in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion in 200 adult patients of ASA physical status I undergoing elective surgery. The patients were divided into eight groups (n = 25 each) according to their premedication. The patients received lansoprazole-lansoprazole (Group L-L), lansoprazole-placebo (Group L-P), placebo-lansoprazole (Group P-L), omeprazole-omeprazole (Group O-O), omeprazole-placebo (Group O-P), placebo-omeprazole (Group P-O), placebo-ranitidine (Group P-R), or placebo-placebo (Group P-P), as the first and second medications. The dose of the study drug was 30 mg for lansoprazole, 150 mg for ranitidine, and 80 mg for omeprazole. The first medication was administered orally at 9:00 PM on the night before surgery and the second at 5:30 AM in the morning on the day of the surgery. Each patient fasted overnight and took the drug with 20 mL of water. After tracheal intubation, gastric fluid was aspirated via an orogastric tube and the volume and pH of the aspirate were measured. The pH of the aspirated gastric fluid was higher in Groups P-R, L-L, P-L, O-O, and O-P than in Group P-P (P < 0.05). The volume of the gastric contents was similar in Groups P-0 and P-P, and the other groups had smaller gastric volume than Group P-P (P < 0.05). Gastric fluid from patients in Group P-R was the least acidic (pH 6.1 +/- 1.2) and had the least volume (0.09 +/- 0.06 mL/kg). Group L-L was comparable with Group P-R in both pH and volume, whereas Groups P-L and O-O were similar to Group P-R only in volume.

Because there are 150,000 admissions per year in the United States for peptic ulcer bleeding, the total hospital cost can be estimated to be $750 million. The actual cost may be higher because our 30 patients had minimal complications and were discharged on average in less than 4 days. The majority of hospital cost is incurred by the intensive care unit or the hospital nursing floor. There is a close to linear relation between the length of stay and the total hospital cost. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a major advance in the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding. It can provide significant cost savings by identifying some patients with bleeding peptic ulcers who have clean bases on endoscopy who are then eligible for prompt discharge from the hospital. In addition, endoscopic thermal therapy (with multipolar electrocautery or heater probe) and injection therapy cost less than $50 in incremental cost and can reduce further bleeding by 43%, reduce the need for urgent surgery by 63%, and reduce the mortality rate by 60%. Some patients still require urgent surgical intervention, which is substantially more costly than endoscopic hemostasis but is highly effective. Preliminary studies show promise in predicting further bleeding, with clinical scoring systems such as the Baylor Bleeding Score and with the use of Doppler ultrasonography. Better prediction of further bleeding should guide the choice of durable hemostasis early in the hospitalization. Additional studies should clarify the role of NSAID avoidance and H. pylori eradication in the long-term prevention of recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding.",I,E

Pirenzepine has been reported to inhibit gastrin secretion. This study was carried out to examine the effects of additional pirenzepine treatment on the hypergastrinemia and gastric acid suppression induced by omeprazole. Concentrations of serum gastrin and plasma somatostatin were measured in 28 peptic ulcer patients before treatment, after omeprazole treatment (20 mg/day) for 2 weeks, and after omeprazole and pirenzepine (100 mg/day) treatment for 2 weeks. The acid inhibitory effect of pirenzepine treatment in addition to omeprazole was evaluated by 24-h intragastric pH measurement in six healthy volunteers. Serum gastrin level was increased significantly, to 2.4-fold the pretreatment level, by omeprazole treatment. Additional treatment with pirenzepine suppressed serum gastrin level to 0.6-fold the omeprazole-treatment level. The serum somatostatin level was not altered significantly either by omeprazole treatment or by omeprazole and pirenzepine treatment. In healthy volunteers whose pH 3 holding time on 24-h intragastric pH monitoring was 70% by omeprazole treatment, omeprazole and pirenzepine treatment markedly increased the pH 3 holding time, to 89%. These findings suggest that pirenzepine is useful in reducing the undesirable effects of omeprazole-induced hypergastrinemia, i.e., the excessive trophic effect of omeprazole on the acid-secreting part of the stomach and the overstimulation of acid secretion. The additional pirenzepine treatment is also effective in suppressing acid secretion.",E,E

I present data on the therapy of patients with GERD and offer a practical approach to their management. The goals of management of GERD are relief of symptoms, healing of esophagitis, prevention of complications, and maintenance of remission. Simple lifestyle changes may control GERD in up to 20% of patients. Promotility therapy addresses the pathophysiology of this disorder, but the best results are only 50 to 60% control using cisapride, whereas the older agents (metoclopramide and bethanechol) are limited by side effects. Acid suppression using histamine receptor antagonists controls GERD in 50 to 60% of patients, whereas proton pump inhibitors offer the most effective control (80-100%). A surgical approach (especially using newer laparoscopic techniques) will provide effective therapy of GERD in a high percentage of patients, but further careful comparisons are needed to define the long-term efficacy and cost issues associated with both surgical and chronic medical therapy of GERD. Despite this lack of long-term data, we know that GERD is a chronic, often lifelong illness, and maintenance therapy should be offered to most patients.

Study data were collected in a large independent practice association model health maintenance organization in Gainesville, Florida, from prescription records maintained in a computerized database and from patient medical records. Patients had to be started on a histamine2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) or the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole between 1992 and 1994. A total of 113 patients qualified for inclusion in the study; 57 received H2RAs, 27 received omeprazole, and 29 received combination therapy. The costs of procedures, physician visits, and drug therapy were considered in the economic evaluation. Costs were evaluated using two methods: the capitation total cost (CTC) and the fee-for-service total cost (FSTC). The mean CTC and FSTC for managing a patient with acid peptic symptoms for 6 months were $382 +/- 356 (range, $14 to $1820) and $456 +/- 368 (range, $52 to $1925), respectively. Drug costs represented 52% of the total FSTC and 62% of the total CTC. Drug costs were followed by the costs for encounters with primary care physicians, endoscopy, referral to specialists, and upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract procedures. Documented outcomes were available for 85 patients. Compared with patients receiving H2RAs (n = 41), patients receiving omeprazole (n = 18) had significantly lower FSTCs ($317 +/- 219 compared with $423 +/- 307, respectively); diagnostic testing costs (for endoscopy, $0 compared with $44 +/- 119, respectively; for UGI procedures, $22 +/- 42 compared with $55 +/- 54, respectively); physician encounter costs ($66 +/- 40 compared with $86 +/- 38, respectively); and referral to specialist costs ($0 compared with $18 +/- 60, respectively). Patients receiving omeprazole also had more positive clinical outcomes than patients receiving H2RAs (78% compared with 49%, respectively), resulting in a more favorable cost of producing a successful outcome compared with patients receiving an H2RA. The cost of success was $407 for patients treated with omeprazole compared with $869 for patients treated with H2RAs. The findings of this analysis conducted under actual clinical conditions support findings of randomized clinical trials showing the cost-effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors.",I,E

Seventeen (19%) demonstrated abnormal gastric acid secretion (percentage time gastric pH < 4 > 50%). The 17 omeprazole failures (OF) were compared with: 1) 19 randomly selected patients with GERD (also studied on omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. and 2) 19 normal volunteers studied on both placebo and omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d..

8771431,How to achieve a near 100% cure rate for H. pylori infection in peptic ulcer patients. A personal viewpoint.,Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bismuth; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Humans; Peptic Ulcer,"de Boer, W A","Infection with Helicobacter pylori is the main etiological factor in duodenal and gastric ulcer disease, and eradication of the organism cures peptic ulcer disease. Cure of the infection therefore has become the ultimate treatment goal in ulcer patients. Only therapies that achieve a > 90% cure rate should be used in clinical practice and, as in any other disease, the therapy with the highest cure rates should be used. Bismuth-based triple therapy is considered the gold standard; it has been used successfully in many studies, usually with good tolerability on the part of patients. Many physicians have been hesitant to prescribe this therapy. The regimen is complex, and it is thought to have many side effects. Several groups have shown that concomitant therapy with a proton pump inhibitor increases efficacy and lessens side effects. Moreover, it has become clear that the duration of treatment can be decreased to just 7 days. With this adjustment it now seems sensible to use this short 7-day quadruple therapy, which at present has superior cure rates when compared with any other anti-Helicobacter therapy. This article is a plea for the use of this regimen and gives practical advice about how to employ therapy in general practice. Suggestions are made about how to motivate a patient to comply with the therapy prescribed. If these suggestions are followed, good compliance seems possible, and a near 100% cure rate will be within reach.",E,E

Lansoprazole and omeprazole are proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). These agents bind covalently to hydrogen/potassium-exchanging adenosine triphosphatase in gastric parietal cells, rendering the molecule nonfunctional and inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid. The bioavailability of lansoprazole is 85%; that of omeprazole is 54%. Although lansoprazole and omeprazole have a plasma half-life of less than 2 hours, the duration of action is more than 24 hours. Clinical trials have shown lansoprazole and omeprazole to be effective in the treatment of duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers, peptic ulcer disease involving Helicobacter pylori infection, recurrent ulcers, ulcers induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, reflux esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In many cases, these PPIs were more effective than histamine H2-receptor antagonists or worked when the latter failed. Lansoprazole and omeprazole have similar adverse-effect profiles and are well tolerated in both long- and short-term therapy. The dosage and duration of therapy vary with the condition being treated or the individual patient. Dosage adjustments should be considered only in the case of lansoprazole in patients with severe liver disease. Lansoprazole and omeprazole are highly specific in blocking a critical step in gastric acid production and have been found to be safe and effective in the treatment of many acid peptic disorders.",E,E

However, measurement of symptomatic outcome is difficult because it is as the patient perceives it to be and not ""objective."" This creates a need to develop a simple and understandable instrument to measure symptomatic outcome.; All patients referred for evaluation of GERD were eligible for this prospective study. During the initial visit, patients were asked to complete the Gastroesophageal Reflux Data Sheet. This ten-item questionnaire included an overall assessment of satisfaction; the best possible score was 0, and the worst was 45. The evaluation included history, physical examination, and additional studies, including upper gastrointestinal series, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring as indicated. Initial treatment was medical with histamine2-blockers, omeprazole, cisapride, or both. If a patient was dissatisfied with medical treatment and had both a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter and abnormal results of the 24-hour pH monitoring, then operative treatment with either laparoscopic or open Nissen or Toupet fundoplication was offered. After approximately three months of medical treatment or one month after operative treatment, patients were asked to complete the questionnaire again. Data were analyzed using nonparametric tests and linear regression analysis.; A total of 72 patients were assessed, and 100 percent of them completed the questionnaire. Patients who were satisfied with their condition had a median health-related quality of life (HRQL) score of five, and those who were dissatisfied had a median score of 26 (p < 0.000001). Patients who ultimately chose surgical therapy had a median preoperative score of 28, compared with 15 for patients who chose to continue medical therapy (p = 0.0001). The change in HRQL score from before treatment to after treatment for surgical patients was 27 compared with 11 for medically treated patients (p < 0.002). Items 1 through 6 of the questionnaire were individually sensitive to the effects of treatment. However, there was no correlation between HRQL and the composite pH score or with the lower esophageal sphincter pressure.; This HRQL score has advantages over standard health status instruments for GERD including simplicity for patients (and therefore a high compliance rate), ease of understanding for physicians, and sensitivity to the effects of treatment. In addition, it may help determine, early in the course of treatment, patients who may ultimately require surgical therapy, thereby avoiding prolonged, but futile, medical therapy.",E,E

Thus, fewer than 10% of identified citations are discussed.; Controlled therapeutic trials were emphasized. The validity of pathophysiological observations and uncontrolled trials were critiqued by the author.; Esophagitis is typically a chronic, recurring disorder treated with long-term antisecretory therapy, titrated to disease severity. Laparoscopic [correction of Laparascopic] antireflux surgery is an alternative strategy, but neither long-term efficacy data nor an appropriate controlled trial comparing it with proton pump inhibitor therapy exists. The main risk of esophagitis is adenocarcinoma arising from Barrett metaplasia, the incidence of which is increasing. Strong evidence suggests that both reflux-induced asthma and otolaryngological complications (subglottic stenosis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, or cancer) can occur without esophagitis. While the otolaryngological manifestations usually respond to antisecretory medications, reflux-induced asthma responds convincingly only to antireflux surgery.; Although esophagitis and GERD symptoms predictably respond to antisecretory medicines, the risk of adenocarcinoma from Barrett metaplasia dictates that if heartburn is refractory to treatment, chronic (>5 years), or accompanied by dysphagia, odynophagia, or bleeding, it should be evaluated by endoscopy. Thereafter, patients with Barrett metaplasia require surveillance endoscopy to control the cancer risk.

At least 5-6 weeks later, endoscopy was repeated with 10 biopsies for urease test, histology and culture to establish cure of infection.; None of the 54 patients included was lost to follow-up but two had a 14C-urea breath test instead of endoscopy. Side-effects did not interfere with compliance. Forty-nine out of 54 patients (91%; 95% CI: 80-97%) were cured. Metronidazole susceptibility data were available from 43 pre-treatment isolates. Of these 38/40 (95%) with a metronidazole-sensitive strain, and one of three with a metronidazole-resistant strain were cured.; Four days of quadruple therapy after omeprazole pre-treatment is a feasible, well tolerated, and effective treatment for H. pylori infection, especially in those carrying a metronidazole-sensitive strain. It seems that in quadruple therapy, cure rate and treatment duration have a non-linear relation. Our results need confirmation, but for patients suffering from side-effects with the 7-day regimen stopping treatment after 4 days is justified.",E,E

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of timing of the 40 mg omeprazole once daily regimen.; We evaluated the difference in effect of 40 mg omeprazole, given as a morning or evening dose, in 17 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Gastric and oesophageal pH was recorded by portable 24-h two-channel pH-metry in a cross-over design of 14 days of morning and 14 days of evening administration.; In five patients pathological reflux was abolished by both regimens, four only during morning dosage, and three only during evening dosage. In the remaining five patients abolition of pathological reflux was not achieved. The therapeutic outcome and patient preference for morning or evening administration were closely related to the individual oesophageal pH curves. Patients with reflux induced by physical activity had a clear preference for morning dosage, patients with nocturnal reflux showed a clear preference for evening dosage. Gastric pH profiles showed a high inter-individual variation; paired statistics, however, revealed a significant impact of dosage timing on the gastric pH profile. After morning dosage the work-day part (the first 7 h) of the gastric pH profile is 0.72 +/- 0.91 (mean difference of pairs +/- s.d.) higher than after evening dosage (P < 0.01). After evening dosage the gastric pH during the supine period is 0.64 +/- 0.83 (mean difference of pairs +/- s.d.) higher than after morning dosage (P = 0.02).; The timing of a 40 mg omeprazole dosage regimen has a clinically significant impact on the 24-h pH profile, and that--by relating to the patient 24-hour oesophageal pH-metry in combination with the patient symptomatology--the timing of this dosage is highly important for therapeutic efficacy.",E,E

The following characteristics appear to be exhibited by patients who are at high risk for developing corticosteroid-induced ulcers: corticosteroids coadministered with NSAIDs, a total dosage greater than 1000 mg of prednisone equivalent, a duration of therapy longer than 30 days, and a history of PUD. Further prospective research examining the association of corticosteroids and PUD in conjunction with other contributing factors is needed. The role of prophylactic therapy to prevent corticosteroid-induced ulcers is not well established. Even though a small study in liver transplant recipients, who are already at increased risk for GI ulceration, has suggested beneficial effects with prophylactic regimens, generalization of these results to all corticosteroid-treated patients would be inappropriate. Large prospective trials to determine the most efficacious prophylactic regimen (e.g., histamine2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, cytoprotective agents [misoprostol]) for corticosteroid-induced ulcerations are not currently available. We suggest that most prophylaxis currently performed is unnecessary. In high-risk patients, however, prophylaxis appears to be prudent until further information is available.",3,E

Eighty patients with duodenal ulcer (62 males and 18 female patients, 16-65 years old) were evaluated for mycotic infection before and after 6 weeks of therapy (cimetidine, 20 patients; famotidine, 40 patients; omeprazole, 20 patients). Mycotic infection was diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy from the ulcer edge subjected to smear, culture, and histopathology and by endoscopic brush samples and gastric aspirate. On the basis of these studies, patients were categorized as having no fungal growth, saprophytic growth, or significant fungal growth. Thirty-five (43.8%) patients had evidence of fungus before ulcer therapy, and 16 of the 35 (20%) had significant fungal growth. The fungal isolation rate was higher in older patients (> and = 45 years of age) and in those with an ulcer size > and = 2 cm. While there was no significant increase in the total number of patients with evidence of fungus after therapy (n = 36), there was a significant increase in those with significant growth (n = 27, p < 0.05) compared with pretreatment status.

The inhibition of H. pylori urease by the novel proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole, was investigated kinetically. It was found to act as an irreversible noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The inhibitory potency of rabeprazole was dependent on the pH of reaction mixture and its Ki values were 0.14 microM (pH 5.0), 0.34 microM (pH 7.0) and 6.10 microM (pH 8.5). Progressive inactivation of urease by rabeprazole initially proceeded according to pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the remaining enzymatic activity at pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C, with a second-order rate constant of 0.0017 microM-1 s-1. When the inactivation half-life was plotted versus the reciprocal of the rabeprazole concentration, a straight line was obtained with a slope of -3.12. From an Arrhenius-plot of the temperature-dependence of the inactivation (over the range of 5-37 degrees C), an activation energy of 13.2 kcal/mol was calculated. Recovery of activity was incomplete for H. pylori urease inhibited by rabeprazole, suggesting that the rabeprazole-urease complex is very stable.",I,E

The pathogenesis of these disorders involves an imbalance between acid secretion and gastric mucosal defenses. Pharmacologic treatment of acid peptic disorders has focused on correcting this imbalance by either improving mucosal defenses with drugs such as sucralfate, bismuth, and prostaglandin analogs, neutralizing acid with antacids, or decreasing acid secretion with histamine2 (H2)-receptor antagonists, or, more recently, proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors are more potent inhibitors of acid secretion than H2-receptor antagonists. In clinical comparisons, proton pump inhibitors were shown to be more effective in the treatment of acid peptic disorders than H2-receptor antagonists. Helicobacter pylori infection is a factor in 85% to 100% of duodenal ulcers and 70% to 90% of gastric ulcers; eradicating this organism results in a considerable decrease in the recurrence of ulcers. Current management of peptic ulcer disease includes the use of combination antisecretory and antibiotic therapy for acute treatment of H pylori-associated disease. Patient self-medication with over-the-counter products, including H2-receptor antagonists, may have an impact on the potential for reducing the recurrence of peptic ulcer disease in patients with H pylori infection. Patients with recurrent disease should be informed of the need to seek medical treatment through aggressive education at the point of sale for over-the-counter drugs.",E,E

Only antibiotic regimens that achieve a 90% cure should be used to treat this infection. Antimicrobial susceptibility is the main determinant in the success of therapy; cure rates are usually lower in resistant strains. As in any other infectious disease it is essential in treatment studies to stratify results according to pretreatment bacterial susceptibility. Cure-rates have to be reported separately for sensitive and resistant strains. It must be realized that a study achieving a high cure rate with a certain regimen can either have included few patients with resistant strains or, alternatively, the regimen tested can have a high efficacy in resistant strains. This issue is fundamental and only if that information is available, do we know whether or not we can reproduce the results reported in that particular study in a different population. We have reviewed all Helicobacter studies that tested pretreatment bacterial susceptibility. The results achieved with dual therapy, bismuth triple therapy, proton pump inhibitor triple therapy and quadruple therapy in sensitive and resistant strains are discussed. Based on these data, treatment recommendations are made for empirical treatment in areas with low resistance rates and those with high resistance rates.

Symptoms were assessed at clinic visits and using daily diary cards, with patient-completed questionnaires providing additional data on symptoms and on psychological disturbance.; On completion, symptom relief favoured omeprazole: 57% of patients on omeprazole were free of heartburn (vs. 19% on placebo), 75% were free of regurgitation (47%) and 43% were completely asymptomatic (14%), each with P < 0.0001. Fewer patients in the omeprazole group required alginate/antacid relief medication (P < 0.05).

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of proton pump inhibitors on duodenal bacteriology, carbohydrate absorption and bowel habit.; Small bowel bacterial overgrowth and xylose absorption were measured by culture of aspirated duodenal fluid and a combined 1 g 14C-D-xylose absorption-metabolism test in 20 patients with peptic ulcer disease. Tests were repeated after 4 weeks of treatment with omeprazole 20 mg daily. Intestinal transit was assessed by recording interdefecatory intervals and stool form.; All patients showed an increase in duodenal bacterial counts following treatment, geometric mean counts increasing from 330 to 95000 CFU/mL. The geometric mean of the difference was 290 CFU/mL (95% CI, 110-720 CFU/mL; P < 0.0001). No changes were noted in the xylose absorption or metabolism tests. Mean interdefecatory intervals decreased by 32% from 31.7 to 21.6 h, the mean difference being 10.1 h (95% CI, 1.6-18.5 h: P = 0.01).

Omeprazole inhibits acid secretion more effectively than cimetidine and might therefore more frequently cause bacterial overgrowth.; This controlled prospective study compared the incidence of gastric and duodenal bacterial overgrowth in patients treated with omeprazole or cimetidine.; 47 outpatients with peptic disease were randomly assigned to a four week treatment regimen with omeprazole 20 mg or cimetidine 800 mg daily. Gastric and duodenal juice were obtained during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and plated for anaerobic and aerobic organisms.; Bacterial overgrowth (> or = 10(5) cfu/ml) was present in 53% of the patients receiving omeprazole and in 17% receiving cimetidine (p < 0.05).

The nitrate, nitrite, and nitrosamine values in gastric juice did not increase after treatment with either cimetidine or omeprazole. Serum concentrations of vitamin B12, beta carotene, and albumin were similar before and after treatment with both drugs.; These results show that the incidence of gastric and duodenal bacterial overgrowth is considerably higher in patients treated with omeprazole compared with cimetidine. This can be explained by more pronounced inhibition of gastric acid secretion. No patient developed signs of malabsorption or an increase of N-nitroso compounds.

In controlled clinical trials, pantoprazole (40mg once daily) has proved superior to ranitidine (300mg once daily or 150mg twice daily) and equivalent to omeprazole (20mg once daily) in the short term (< or = 8 weeks) treatment of acute peptic ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. Gastric and duodenal ulcer healing proceeded significantly faster with pantoprazole than with ranitidine, and at similar rates with pantoprazole and omeprazole. The time course of gastric ulcer pain relief was similar with pantoprazole, ranitidine and omeprazole, whereas duodenal ulcer pain was alleviated more rapidly with pantoprazole than ranitidine. Pantoprazole (40mg once daily) showed superior efficacy to famotidine (40mg once daily) in ulcer healing and pain relief after 2 weeks in patients with duodenal ulcer in a large multicentre nonblinded study. In mild to moderate acute reflux oesophagitis, significantly greater healing was obtained with pantoprazole than with ranitidine and famotidine, whereas similar healing rates were seen with pantoprazole and omeprazole. Pantoprazole showed a significant advantage over ranitidine in relieving symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation. Reflux symptoms were similarly alleviated by pantoprazole and omeprazole. Preliminary results indicate that triple therapy with pantoprazole, clarithromycin and either metronidazole or tinidazole is effective in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-associated disease; however, these findings require confirmation in large well-controlled studies. Pantoprazole appears to be well tolerated during short term oral administration, with diarrhoea (1.5%), headache (1.3%), dizziness (0.7%), pruritus (0.5%) and skin rash (0.4%) representing the most frequent adverse events. The drug has lower affinity than omeprazole or lansoprazole for hepatic cytochrome P450 and shows no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions at therapeutic doses with a wide range of drug substrates for this isoenzyme system. In conclusion, pantoprazole is superior to ranitidine and as effective as omeprazole in the short term treatment of peptic ulcer and reflux oesophagitis, has shown efficacy when combined with antibacterial agents in H. pylori eradication, is apparently well tolerated and offers the potential advantage of minimal risk of drug interaction.",E,E

Initial therapy includes lifestyle modifications, avoidance of certain medications, and use of antacids, alginic acid preparations, and over-the-counter histamine2 (H2) receptor antagonists. Escalation of therapy for acute disease relies primarily on H2 receptor antagonists given in conventional dosages. Although H2 receptor antagonists remain the cornerstone of therapy, sucralfate and promotility agents, especially cisapride, may offer alternatives. Most cases of GERD that are resistant to these therapies can be reliably healed with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Patients whose GERD is healed with one of the aforementioned agents often relapse unless they receive further therapy. For patients with mild disease, H2 receptor antagonists, cisapride, or a combination of the two may prevent recurrent symptoms. In severe disease, PPIs are the agents of first choice, but concerns about the safety of long-term use must be considered. In selected patients, surgery offers an option for long-term control of GERD. With present surgical techniques, symptom relief can be obtained with little risk of complications.",E,E

Those patients will remain at risk of developing a potentially fatal complication of peptic ulcer disease. Therefore, a new attempt to cure H. pylori infection after initial failure of therapy is indicated. We studied the efficacy of three retreatment regimens after initial failure of omeprazole-amoxicillin dual therapy.; Fifty-three patients whose treatment failed were randomly assigned to receive retreatment with the same regimen of omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. (group I) or omeprazole 40 mg t.i.d. (group II) plus amoxicillin 750 mg t.i.d. for 14 days. Forty patients in whom the omeprazole-amoxicillin retreatment failed were assigned to receive omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 750 mg t.i.d., and metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d. for 14 days (group III) or omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. plus clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. for 14 days (group IV). H. pylori infection was assessed by culture and histology of gastric biopsies before and 4-6 wk after cessation of therapy. Susceptibility of H. pylori to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole was determined by the E test.; In groups I (n = 28) and II (n = 25), cure of H. pylori infection was achieved in 21% and 28% of patients, respectively (not significant). In groups III (n = 20) and IV (n = 20), H. pylori infection was cured in 75% and 70%, respectively.; Retreatment with an identical omeprazole-amoxicillin dual regimen is of limited benefit, a result that is independent of the omeprazole dose.

However, the optimum regimen for the eradication of H. pylori remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the eradication rate of H. pylori, the side effects, and the patients' compliance with regard to various drug regimens. We also analyzed factors influencing the eradication of H. pylori. One hundred and eighty patients were included and divided into four groups: 42 patients (Group I) received tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (240 mg b.i.d.), metronidazole (250 mg t.i.d.) and amoxicillin (500 mg t.i.d.) for 14 days; 55 patients (Group 2) received omeprazole (20 mg b.i.d.) and amoxicillin (1000 mg b.i.d.) for 14 days; 36 patients (Group 3) were treated with omeprazole (20 mg b.i.d.), metronidazole (250 mg t.i.d.) and amoxicillin (500 mg t.i.d.) for 14 days; and 47 patients (Group 4) received omeprazole (20 mg q.d.) and amoxicillin (500 mg t.i.d.) for 14 days and then tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (240 mg b.i.d.) and nizatidine (150 mg q.d.) for 14 days. The diagnosis of H. pylori was made by histology. The eradication of H. pylori was defined both by histology (H&E and Giemsa stain) and by rapid urease test (CLOR) showing negative for H. pylori 4 weeks after the completion of therapy. Of the 180 patients, 95 patients had non-ulcer dyspepsia, 40 patients had gastric ulcer and 45 patients had duodenal ulcer. The eradication rate of H. pylori was highest (89.3%) in Group 3, as compared with Group 1 (68.9%), Group 2 (65.4%), and Group 4 (48.9%). The eradication rate was significantly higher in Group 3 than in Groups 2 and 4 (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the eradication rate among clinical diagnosis, sex and age. But, in the conventional triple therapy (Group 1), the eradication rate was higher in male (78.6%) than in female (46.2%). The side effects in order, were nausea (22.1%), dizziness (19.5%), abdominal pain (11.6%) and diarrhea (97%), and there was no difference among the drug regimens. The compliance of the patients was good (more than 80% irrespective of drug regimen). On the basis of these findings, the side effects of the drugs seemed minimal, and the compliance of patients was good irrespective of the drug regimen. In conclusion, the triple therapy with omeprazole, metronidazole and amoxicillin was the most effective regimen and could be recommended for H. pylori eradication.",E,E

The pharmacokinetic parameters for prednisolone, including the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax), terminal-phase half-life (t1/2), and area under the concentration-time curve, were comparable for the three regimens. Adverse events (AEs) rated as possibly or probably drug related were reported by 50%, 24%, and 47% for subjects in the lansoprazole, omeprazole, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Headache was the most common drug-related AE. No serious AEs were reported, and no subject withdrew from the study because of an AE. Concomitant administration of lansoprazole or omeprazole does not affect the absorption, biotransformation, or disposition of a single dose of prednisone.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of these factors on parameters of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.; Prevalence of H. pylori was determined by biopsy and antibody testing in 84 patients. The influence of H. pylori status on clinical and laboratory parameters of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome was evaluated. Seroconversion after surgery was assessed retrospectively in infected patients.; The prevalence of H. pylori exposure was 23% (10% with active infection). Acid output was higher in H. pylori-negative patients, but other clinical and biochemical parameters did not differ. Parameters were also similar for patients determined to be H. pylori positive by histology or antibody testing alone. Seroconversion rates did not differ between those rendered or not rendered disease free despite a significant reduction in acid output.; H. pylori infection is not a risk factor for peptic ulceration in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The prevalence is lower than in the general population and much lower than for patients with idiopathic peptic ulcer disease. Long-term omeprazole therapy in H. pylori-positive patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may-lead to a reduction in parietal cell mass.",E,E

H pylori was eradicated in 6 of 19 patients in the OAM group (32%); 8 of 18 in the RAM group (44%), 4 of 15 in the OC group (27%); none of 18 in the OP group (0%). [< P0.005 for OAM, RAM, OC vs OP; P = N.S. between OAM, RAM, OC]. Overall metronidazole resistance was unexpectedly high at 58%. Eradication rates in metronidazole sensitive patients were 71% (5/7) and 100% (3/3) for OAM and RAM respectively. In conclusion, H pylori eradication rates using high dose ranitidine plus amoxycillin and metronidazole may be similar to that of low dose omeprazole in combination with the same antibiotics for omeprazole with clarithromycin. Overall eradication rates were low due to a high incidence of metronidazole resistance but were higher in metronidazole-sensitive patients. Even high dose ranitidine with two antibiotics achieves a relatively low eradication rate. These metronidazole-based regimens cannot be recommended in areas with a high incidence of metronidazole resistance.",E,E

Cytotoxicity of DSS towards intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte hybridomas or fresh intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes seems to have concentration, time, and cell type dependency with increasing concentrations and time causing increased cytotoxicity.; Integrin alpha 4 expression was marginally down regulated by 0.5% of DSS, while alpha M290 expression was up regulated. DSS inhibits the binding of 9.1 gamma delta cells to both extracellular matrix (ECM) and epithelial cells. Conversely at high concentrations it increases binding to all ECM except poly-L-lysine. Various cytokines including TGF beta, interleukin 2, and tumour necrosis factor alpha as well as prostaglandin alter the expression of the integrin alpha 4 and M290 subunits at the cell surface, and also alter the adhesion of 9.1 gamma delta cells to epithelial monolayers. The expression of a large number of cell adhesion molecules expressed on intraepithelial lymphocytes is affected by a combination of the abundant gut cytokine TGF beta and DSS, suggesting that DSS induced colitis may ultimately arise from a combination of gut cytokine and DSS. DSS also triggers intraepithelial lymphocyte aggregation on all ECM coated plate tested.; These data suggest that the potential roles of DSS induced colitis may be: (a) direct cytotoxicity; (b) interference with the normal interaction between intestinal lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and ECMs; (c) aberrant modulation of the expression of the integrin beta 7 receptors, other cell receptors, and their functions.",5,E

The appropriate medical therapy should be individualized to the severity of symptoms, the degree of esophagitis and the presence of other acid-reflux complications. Lifestyle changes should form the basis of any therapeutic approach. In patients with mild to moderate disease, initial therapy with histamine H2-receptor antagonists in conventional dosages is suggested. Prokinetic agents are potentially useful in patients with impaired esophageal or gastric motor function, but their efficacy as single agents does not appear to surpass that of standard doses of H2 blockers. Sucralfate, a cytoprotective agent, is an additional therapeutic option. For patients with more severe disease, omeprazole and lansoprazole provide unequaled healing rates and accelerated symptom relief. In most patients, maintenance therapy is vital.

Because scleroderma is a multisystem disease and complications do occur, however, careful antenatal evaluations, discussion of potential problems, and participation in a high-risk obstetric monitoring program is very important to optimize the best outcome. Because women with diffuse scleroderma are at greater risk for developing serious cardiopulmonary and renal problems early in the disease, they should be encouraged to delay pregnancy until the disease stabilizes. All patients who become pregnant during this high-risk time should be monitored extremely carefully. Although there are some suggestions that there are increases in infertility and miscarriages before disease onset, recent studies show that these issues probably do not have major impact for women with established scleroderma who plan to become pregnant. The high risk of premature and small infants may be minimized with specialized obstetric and neonatal care, however. Renal crisis in scleroderma is the only truly unique aspect of these pregnant, which, unlike blood pressure elevation in nonscleroderma pregnancies, must be treated aggressively with ACE inhibitors. Other pregnancy problems may not be unique to scleroderma, but because it is a chronic illness, any complication carries higher risks for both mother and child. Careful planning, close monitoring, and aggressive management should allow women with scleroderma to have a high likelihood of a successful pregnancy.",E,E

As expected healing rates were high and comparable (75 vs. 85%), however, Hp-eradication was zero in both groups. In the subsequent second part of the trial group A (n = 19) received omeprazole (20 mg bid) for 2 weeks + amoxicillin (CAS 26787-78-0) tablets (1 g bid only 2nd week). Accumulated healing rate increased to 95% but Hp-eradication was 37%. From group B only 8 patients participated in a second 4-week course of monotherapy with TDB. Whereas healing occurred in all individuals, Hp-eradication was still low (12.5%). In addition plasma levels (omeprazole, Bi) and urinary excretion (Bi) were monitored to test whether drug interaction and/or noncompliance of the patients could help to explain the clinical findings. Systemic availability of Bi was increased by the coadministration of omeprazole and plasma levels of omeprazole were in general higher in Hp-positive patients if compared to those of Hp-negative patients. The following conclusions could be drawn from the 4 parts of the study: Treatment of peptic ulcer disease with omeprazole either alone or in combination with TDB is effective for ulcer healing but not for eradicating Hp. Omeprazole seems to decrease the Hp-eradicating potential of Bi probably due to a drug interaction. A second treatment course with TDB is apparently not of much benefit. One week pretreatment with omeprazole does not affect healing but might attenuate Hp-eradication rate of subsequent combined treatment with amoxicillin. One week coadministration of amoxicillin is not sufficient. The magnitude of omeprazole's plasma levels has no effect on Hp-eradication rates. As the numbers of patients in this study was relatively small these conclusions need to be confirmed by larger trials.",E,E

Serum gastrin levels, antral gastrin cells, fundic argyrophil cells, parameters of gastritis, and H. pylori infection were evaluated regularly.; In nonantrectomized patients, serum gastrin levels increased from a median of 76 pg/mL to 163 pg/mL within 3 months. Antral gastrin cell density increased from 175 to 267 cells/mm2 (P < 0.001), and fundic argyrophil cell density increased from 83 to 149 cells/mm2 (P < 0.001). Chronic inflammation, activity, and atrophy of the oxyntic mucosa worsened exclusively in patients with H. pylori infection. Linear and/or micronodular argyrophil cell hyperplasia was diagnosed in 2.6% of patients before lansoprazole and in 29.2% after 5 years treatment. These changes were significantly related to serum gastrin levels, H. pylori infection, chronic inflammation, and atrophy of the oxyntic mucosa.; H. pylori represents an important factor for the progression of fundic gastritis and the development of argyrophil cell hyperplasia during long-term treatment with lansoprazole.",I,E

The aim of this study was to search for signs of complement activation in human liver allografts and evaluate their relationship to cell injury and leukocyte sequestration.; In 33 postreperfusion biopsy specimens, 9 preoperative specimens, and 10 intraoperative specimens, the cytolytic membrane attack complex of complement was localized, expression of complement inhibitors was evaluated, and intragraft accumulation of leukocytes and platelets was quantitated.; In control samples and preoperative biopsy specimens, the membrane attack complex was detected only in extracellular deposits, associated with its soluble inhibitors clusterin and vitronectin. Comparable observations were performed in 14 postoperative specimens. In the remaining 19 postoperative specimens, membrane attack complex decorated a variable proportion of hepatocytes. The extent of membrane attack complex deposition correlated with the increase in postoperative aspartate aminotransferase levels in serum (P = 0.002) and the decrease in postoperative factor V levels in serum (P = 0.002).

All patients had been medically treated prior to referral, although 84 per cent had heartburn and 2 per cent had laryngitis despite 20 to 40 mg/day of omeprazole. Fifteen per cent of patients were intolerant of or would no longer take omeprazole. Patients were evaluated by esophageal manometry (in 100%) and 24-hour pH studies (in 66%). Seventy-six per cent of patients had lower-esophageal sphincter pressure <15 mm Hg. Five patients had low esophageal body peristaltic pressures (<35 mm Hg).

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of esophageal acid control on the symptoms of reflux disease, healing of erosive esophagitis, change in length of Barrett's epithelium, and the appearance of squamous islands.; Thirteen of 27 patients on 60 mg lansoprazole underwent ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring while on therapy. Symptoms were recorded, and the length of Barrett's epithelium was measured, photographed, and biopsied every 6 months over an average of 5.7 yr.; Eight of 13 patients had a normal 24 h pH (group I, mean pH < 4, 0.8%), five patients had abnormal results (group II, mean pH < 4, 10.6%). Symptoms improved in all patients, and there was complete healing of erosive esophagitis in all patients. An increase in the number of squamous islands was noted in 62.5% of patients in group I and in 80% of patients in group II. The mean length of Barrett's epithelium at baseline and study completion in group I was 5.6 and 5.0 cm, respectively (mean decrease, 0.6 cm), and for group II was 4.2 and 4.2 cm, respectively (mean decrease, 0 cm). There was no significant difference in the change in length between the two groups (p = 0.494).; Although symptoms improved, erosive esophagitis healed, and squamous islands increased, there was no significant decrease in the length of Barrett's esophagus.

However, there is no clear evidence that acid-suppressing drugs have beneficial effects in peptic ulcer haemorrhage. Endoscopic haemostatic treatment provides important reduction in morbidity and may be more efficient when a neutral intragastric pH is maintained.; We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study of intravenous infusion of omeprazole (80 mg as bolus, followed by 8 mg/h) or placebo for 72 h. All patients received 20 mg omeprazole orally from day 3 until follow-up on day 21. Only patients with ulcer haemorrhage, endoscoped within 12 h after admission, and with a history or signs of circulatory failure and spurting bleeding, oozing bleeding, visible vessel, or clot, were included. Endoscopic intervention was aimed at when spurting bleeding, oozing bleeding, or a visible vessel was observed. The primary efficacy measure was the worst ranking on an overall outcome scale (5 = death, 4 = surgery, 3 = additional endoscopic treatment, 2 = more than 3 units of blood, and 1 = no more than 3 units of blood transfused). Base-line prognostic factors of treatment success by day 3 and of other binary outcomes were considered in a logistic regression model.; Two hundred and seventy-four patients were randomly assigned to omeprazole (134 patients) or placebo (140 patients). The number of patients included in the 'intention-to-treat' analysis was 130 in the omeprazole group and 135 in the placebo group.

Over long-term follow-up, objective group patients had less recurrent dysphagia (p = 0.02) and required fewer redilation sessions (p < 0.05). Overall, the pill test correlated with the presence or absence of dysphagia (P < 0.001). Predictive value of passing the pill 1 week after dilation for the absence of dysphagia was 100%, but of failing the pill test and the presence of dysphagia was only 18%.; Achieving an objective end point reduces stricture recurrence and the need for subsequent dilation.

The rates per 100,000 population in the catchment areas were calculated.; Antireflux surgery almost always implied fundoplication. During 1993, 784 fundoplications and 43 other antireflux procedures were performed in Finland (total population around 5 million). The fundoplication rate per 100,000 population rose from 8.8 to 15.4 between 1988 and 1993. The increase was minimal (8.1-8.2) in 1990-91 when the first proton-pump inhibitor, omeprazole, was introduced, but remarkably greater (12.8-15.4) in 1992-93, when the laparoscopic technique became popular. Differences in fundoplication rates were six to tenfold between health service districts and even larger between hospitals.; The numbers of antireflux operations in Finland were almost static when proton-pump inhibitors were introduced, but rapidly increased after the advent of the laparoscopic technique.

For each drug class, linear regression analysis estimated the average percentage of patients who were healed and heartburn free per week.; Mean overall healing proportion irrespective of drug dose or treatment duration (< or =12 weeks) was highest with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs; 83.6% +/- 11.4%) vs. H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs; 51.9% +/- 17.1%), sucralfate (39.2% +/- 22.4%), or placebo (28.2% +/- 15.6%). Correcting for patients without baseline heartburn, the mean heartburn-free proportion was highest with PPIs (77.4% +/- 10.4%) vs. H2RAs (47.6% +/- 15.5%). PPIs showed a significantly faster healing rate (11.7%/wk) vs. H2RAs (5.9%/wk) and placebo (2.9%/wk). PPIs provided faster, more complete heartburn relief (11.5%/wk) vs. H2RAs (6.4%/wk).; More complete esophagitis healing and heartburn relief is observed with PPIs vs. H2RAs and occurs nearly twice as fast.

For all other patients, providing maintenance PPI after a patient experiences two recurrences is the least costly but least effective approach. The other two approaches prevent more recurrences: waiting to initiate maintenance therapy until symptoms recur once requires an additional $73 for each recurrence prevented whereas maintenance PPI from the outset requires an additional $819 for each recurrence prevented. Maintenance therapy from the outset is cost effective if symptoms of esophagitis cause a 22% or greater decrement in quality of life (using $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained as a cost-effectiveness definition). However, withholding maintenance until the time of a first recurrence is cost effective if symptoms cause a 2% or greater decrement in quality of life.; For grades 2 and 3 esophagitis, providing maintenance therapy after a patient experiences a further recurrence is a preferred option that appears cost-effective across a wide array of assumptions.

Recent advances in the understanding of peptic ulcer disease indicate that infection with Helicobacter pylori and ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the cause of almost all gastric and duodenal ulcers. Our therapy, therefore, is in a state of transition: the old acid-suppressive temporary therapy that allows frequent ulcer recurrences and complications is being replaced by curative therapies. The old therapy, by reducing gastric acid secretion or enhancing gastric mucosal defenses, inhibited the cofactors needed for ulcer development. Acid suppression relieved symptoms and healed ulcers, while defense enhancers, such as prostaglandin analogs healed and prevented acute NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. These benefits were maintained, however, only as long as acid-reducing agents or mucosal defense enhancers were continued. On the other hand, curative therapies (such as eradicating H. pylori infection and/or stopping the use of NSAIDs) eliminate the causes of ulcer. Curative combination regimens consisting of antibiotics, ranitidine bismuth citrate, bismuth, and proton pump inhibitors have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. These new regimens can cure benign gastric ulcer. Unfortunately, we cannot always determine which gastric ulcers are benign, and concern about gastric cancer remains. All gastric ulcers therefore still require biopsy and histological examination. With new treatment regimens, the time may be rapidly approaching when ulcer disease will be ""history.""",E,E

The European Helicobacter Pylori Study Group therefore organised a meeting in Maastricht of H pylori experts, primary care physicians and representatives of National Societies of Gastroenterology from Europe to establish consensus guidelines on the management of H pylori at the primary care and specialist levels, and to consider general health care issues associated with the infection. As in previous guidelines, eradication therapy was recommended in all H pylori positive patients with peptic ulcer disease. Additionally, at the primary care level in dyspeptic patients < 45 years old and with no alarm symptoms, diagnosis is recommended by non-invasive means (13C urea breath test, serology) and if H pylori positive the patient should be treated. Moreover, at the specialist level the indications for eradication of H pylori were also broadened to include H pylori positive patients with functional dyspepsia in whom no other possible causes of symptoms are identified by the specialist (after a full investigation including endoscopy, ultrasound and other necessary investigations), patients with low grade gastric mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (managed in specialised centres) and those with gastritis with severe macro- or microscopic abnormalities. There was consensus that treatment regimens should be simple, well tolerated and achieve an eradication rate of over 80% on an intention to treat basis. It was strongly recommended, therefore, that eradication treatment should be with proton pump inhibitor based triple therapy for seven days, using a proton pump inhibitor and two of the following: clarithromycin, a nitroimidazole (metronidazole or tinidazole) and amoxycillin.",3,E

Symptoms were controlled with acetaminophen and antacids.; Of 100 consecutive patients with endoscopically established duodenal ulcer, 97 with positive rapid urease test on antral biopsy specimens were admitted into the study and 81 completed the trial. Of these, 40 were randomised to receive antibiotics and 41 to receive placebo. Treatment with antibiotics resulted in 92.5% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 84.3-100) healing at four weeks and 100% at eight and 12 weeks; the corresponding healing rates for placebo treatment were respectively, 36.6%, 61%, and 63.4% (95% CIs 21.8-51.3, 46.0-75.9, and 48.7-78.2 respectively).

It has proved effective in combination regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori and as monotherapy to heal and relieve symptoms of gastric or duodenal ulcers and gastro-oesophageal reflux. After initial healing, it may be used to prevent recurrence of oesophageal erosions or peptic ulcers in patients in whom H. pylori is not the major cause of ulceration and to reduce basal acid output in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Usual dosages are 15 to 60 mg/day, although dosages of < or = 180 mg/day have been used in patients with hypersecretory states. In patients with duodenal or gastric ulcer, short term lansoprazole monotherapy was similar to omeprazole and superior to histamine H2 receptor antagonists in achieving healing rates > 90%. Lansoprazole was as effective a component of H. pylori eradication regimens as omeprazole, tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (colloidal bismuth subcitrate) or ranitidine. Lansoprazole was superior to ranitidine in symptom relief and healing of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and tended to relieve symptoms more rapidly than omeprazole, although initial healing was similar. As maintenance treatment, lansoprazole was similar to omeprazole and superior to ranitidine in relieving symptoms and preventing relapse. Lansoprazole was also superior to ranitidine in healing and relieving symptoms of oesophageal erosions associated with Barrett's oesophagus; healing was maintained for a mean of 2.9 years in > or = 70% of patients. Lansoprazole was also superior to ranitidine in prophylaxis of redilatation of oesophageal strictures. After > or = 4 years of use in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, lansoprazole 60 to 180 mg/day effectively controlled basal acid output. Dosages may be reduced in some patients once healing and symptom relief has been achieved. Preliminary studies of lansoprazole in patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia or stress ulcers show promise. Although studies show lansoprazole is potentially effective in treating gastrointestinal bleeding, future studies should assess patients' H. pylori status. Lansoprazole has been well tolerated in clinical trials, with headache, diarrhoea, dizziness and nausea appearing to be the most common adverse effects. Tolerability of lansoprazole does not deteriorate with age and the drug is well tolerated in long term use (< or = 4 years) in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or reflux disease. Thus, lansoprazole is an important alternative to omeprazole and H2 receptor antagonists in acid-related disorders. In addition to its efficacy in healing or maintenance treatment, it may provide more effective symptom relief than other comparator agents.",E,E

In poor metabolizers, the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve [AUC(0-8)] of (+)-omeprazole was larger and that of the 5-hydroxy metabolite of this enantiomer was smaller than the AUC(0-8) values in extensive metabolizers (p < 0.001). The mean AUC(0-8) of the (-)-enantiomer of omeprazole was also higher in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers, but only 3.1-fold compared with 7.5-fold for (+)-omeprazole. The rate of formation of the hydroxy metabolite from (-)-omeprazole was low and not significantly different in poor and extensive metabolizers. These results show that (+)-omeprazole is to a major extent hydroxylated by CYP2C19. Also (-)-omeprazole may partly be metabolized by this enzyme but is mainly metabolized by another enzyme, presumably CYP3A4, to the achiral sulfone metabolite. The plasma concentration ratio of omeprazole to 5-hydroxyomeprazole obtained 3 hours after the drug intake has been used to distinguish between extensive and poor metabolizer phenotypes. With use of the ratio between the (+)-enantiomers of the parent drug and the metabolite, a better discrimination between phenotypes was obtained. The ratio between the (-)-enantiomers also separated the phenotypes but was less discriminatory. For the future, measurement of total concentrations will suffice for phenotyping.",I,E

An 820 bp amplified fragment of the ureC gene was digested with the restriction enzymes Sau3A and Hhal. Fourteen different Sau3A patterns and 15 different Hhal patterns were identified among the pretreatment isolates. In combination, 42 different RFLP types were identified. Comparison of isolates before treatment with those after treatment showed that five of ten patients on clarithromycin-omeprazole dual therapy had the same RFLP type and that all 12 patients on omeprazole therapy alone had the same RFLP type. All isolates were susceptible to clarithromycin prior to treatment, while seven of ten patients on clarithromycin-omeprazole therapy had H. pylori that was resistant to clarithromycin after therapy and 11 of 12 patients on omeprazole therapy had isolates susceptible to clarithromycin after treatment. In addition to PCR-RFLP typing, the presence of the cytotoxin-associated gene (cagA) and the vacuolating gene (vacA) was determined; 79% of the isolates were cagA-positive and all were vacA-positive.

In the absence of drugs that adequately correct the motility defects of GERD, treatment is directed towards decreasing gastric acidity. Oesophageal healing is related to control of 24-h intragastric acidity, the degree of acid suppression and duration of treatment. H2-receptor antagonists are generally less effective in GERD than in peptic ulcer disease. While providing symptomatic relief in non-erosive GERD, they are often ineffective in healing erosive oesophagitis. Proton pump inhibitors provide more rapid and complete healing and symptom resolution. They are superior to H2-receptor antagonists in the long-term management of erosive oesophagitis and in reducing recurrence of oesophageal stricture following mechanical dilatation. In Barrett's oesophagus, high-dose proton pump inhibitors in combination with laser/photodynamic ablation therapy can produce metaplastic regression, although this does not preclude future emergence of adenocarcinoma. Surgical morbidity and mortality rates in GERD generally remain higher than those associated with long-term pharmacotherapy. However, direct comparisons between laparascopic anti-reflux surgery and proton pump inhibitor maintenance therapy remain to be performed. Although there is no evidence that H. pylori infection worsens the severity of oesophagitis or that H. pylori is carcinogenic in the metaplastic oesophageal mucosa. It has been suggested that H. pylori-positive patients requiring long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy receive bacterial eradication therapy to reduce the risk of developing atrophic gastritis.",E,E

However, eradication rates are highly variable, especially if a proton pump inhibitor is used with amoxycillin. Therefore it is important to define factors/predictors of the clinical outcome.; In a single-blind study, 60 H. pylori-positive patients prospectively matched for diagnosis (erosive gastritis, duodenal and gastric ulcer), age (above and below 50 years) and smoking habits were randomly treated (each group n = 20) for 2 weeks with amoxycillin (1 mg b.d.) and either omeprazole (20 mg b.d.), lansoprazole (30 mg b.d.) or ranitidine (300 mg b.d.). Intragastric pH and plasma levels of the administered drugs were monitored over a dosing interval of 12 h.; The overall eradication rates were 45% (intention-to-treat, ITT, 27/60) or 47% (per protocol 27/58); they did not differ (ITT) between omeprazole (50%), lansoprazole (40%) and ranitidine (45%). Median pH and time at which intragastric pH was above 4 was slightly lower for ranitidine (4.0 +/- 1.7; 51 +/- 25%) than for omeprazole (5.4 +/- 1.1: 77 +/- 25%; P < 0.05) or lansoprazole (4.4 +/- 1.6: 68 +/- 32%). Plasma concentrations of amoxycillin were comparable in all three treatment groups. Post-treatment H. pylori status was not dependent on those levels, or the drug-induced extent or duration of increased intragastric pH. However, H. pylori-eradicated patients were significantly (P < 0.05) older (56 +/- 13 years) than patients still H. pylori-positive (47 +/- 14 years).

However, information about long-term effects on intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin response with such drug regimens is scarce.; Sixteen healthy subjects (11 men, 5 women, mean age 29 years) randomly received either 20 or 40 mg of omeprazole once daily (at 08.00 h) for 3 months. Gastric pH was recorded every 6 s for 24 h from noon to noon under standardized conditions, and blood samples were collected hourly in order to determine the 24-h plasma gastrin response on day 0 (pre-entry), day 7, day 28 and day 90.; From day 0 to day 7, 24-h median pH increased from 1.7 to 4.6 and mean percentage of time at pH < 4 decreased from 89% to 35% with omeprazole 20 mg. Respective values with omeprazole 40 mg were 1.9 to 4.3, and 89% to 34%. Inhibition of gastric acidity remained unchanged during the 3 months of treatment. Despite similar effects on the basis of 24-h analysis, the decrease in daytime acidity was slightly higher with omeprazole 40 mg than with omeprazole 20 mg. Twenty-four-hour integrated plasma gastrin significantly increased with both drug regimens between day 0 and day 7 (P < 0.01), and between day 7 and day 28 (P < 0.01) with omeprazole 40 mg; there was no significant increase between day 28 and day 90 with either of the drug regimens.; Omeprazole 20 and 40 mg/day provides long-term stable acid suppression with a progressive increase in gastrin response, stabilizing after 2 months of treatment.",E,E

Symptoms and quality of life were assessed at 4 weeks. Patients still experiencing heartburn continued therapy for a further 4 weeks and the assessments were repeated.; At 4 weeks, heartburn was resolved in 65% (95% CI: 57-73%), 56% (48-64%) and 41% (32%-49%) of patients treated, respectively, with omeprazole 20 mg and 10 mg once daily, and cisapride. Both omeprazole doses were significantly more effective than cisapride (P < 0.01). The same order of efficacy was observed regardless of the presence of erosive oesophagitis. Regurgitation and epigastric pain also improved to a greater degree with omeprazole than with cisapride. Quality of life was improved in all treatment groups, and the improvement in the reflux dimension of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) score was significantly different between groups (P = 0.002).; Omeprazole 20 or 10 mg once daily is significantly more effective than cisapride in the resolution of heartburn, regardless of the presence of erosive oesophagitis, and this is accompanied by an improvement in patient quality of life.",I,E

Four biopsy samples were taken, each from the greater curvature of the antrum and body of the stomach. Biopsies were histologically investigated by ELISA to determine the density of H. pylori, the degree of neutrophil infiltration and the IL-8 concentration in the mucosa.; In the gastric mucosa of H. pylori-negative subjects, no IL-8 and hardly any neutrophil infiltration were observed. In contrast, enhanced IL-8 production and increased neutrophil infiltration were present in those infected with H. pylori. In H. pylori-positive patients, a significant correlation was observed between the IL-8 concentration and the degree of neutrophil infiltration, but no correlation was found in the body mucosa of those with DU. Twelve of 20 DU patients demonstrated hardly any neutrophil infiltration, despite the increased mucosal IL-8 content in the body. The administration of omeprazole in DU patients markedly increased mucosal neutrophil infiltration even though it did not cause any significant change in the H. pylori density and IL-8 concentration in the body. Although the effect of omeprazole was transient, a significant increase in neutrophil infiltration continued in comparison with the status before omeprazole administration in those subsequently undergoing maintenance treatment with H2-blockers.; In H. pylori-positive chronic gastritis, IL-8 concentration is enhanced in the mucosa of the body, and is associated with increased neutrophil infiltration. However, in DU patients, despite increases in body IL-8 concentration, neutrophil infiltration is reduced and the gastritis may be localized in the antrum.",E,E

So far, only low response rates to medical and surgical therapy of GERD have been reported. However, the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors, to date the most effective medical therapy for GERD, has never been evaluated in this population. Our purpose, therefore, was to study the effect of omeprazole on healing and symptom relief in the intellectually disabled.; The treatment scheme was as follows: omeprazole 40 mg was given once daily (o.d.) as a healing dose for 3 months, and omeprazole 20 mg o.d. was given as a maintenance dose for another 3 months, to intellectually disabled subjects with endoscopically proven esophagitis, grades I-IV, according to Savary-Miller classification. After 3 and 6 months, the result of this treatment was evaluated by symptom scoring and/or endoscopy. In case of relapse, the dose was increased.; At the first endoscopy, 40 of 107 patients (37%) had grade I, 36 (34%) grade II, 18 (17%) grade III, and 13 (12%) grade IV esophagitis. In 92 of 104 patients (88%), the treatment scheme was effective in healing the esophagitis and keeping patients in remission, independent of the severity of esophagitis. In 11 of 104 (11%) patients, a symptomatic relapse was observed after the dose was decreased to 20 mg o.d. However, all of these patients became symptom free again after the dose was increased to 40 mg o.d., and all were healed endoscopically at the end of the study. One (1%) patient needed omeprazole 60 mg o.d. for healing, but in this patient, no relapse was seen while on a maintenance dose of omeprazole 40 mg o.d. Marked improvement of persistent vomiting, hematemesis, regurgitation, food refusal, iron deficiency anemia, and depressive symptoms was seen at the end of the study.; This study indicates that omeprazole is highly effective for all grades of esophagitis in the intellectually disabled. The dose needed to maintain them in remission can be titrated according to the reflux symptoms.",3,E

The proton pump inhibitors lansoprazole and omeprazole produce faster rates of healing and greater symptomatic relief in patients with acid-related disorders than histamine2-receptor antagonists, are well tolerated, and are associated with few adverse events. Compared with omeprazole, which interacts with diazepam, warfarin, and phenytoin, lansoprazole produces only a minor increase in theophylline clearance. Proton pump inhibitors in combination with antibiotic therapy can eradicate Helicobacter pylori, the main risk factor in the recurrence of peptic ulcer disease, obviating the need for maintenance therapy. Long-term acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors may be necessary to prevent the recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The safety and efficacy profile of these agents makes them ideal for the treatment of acid-related diseases in elderly patients.",E,E

Gastric acid hypersecretion can be observed in patients with head trauma or neurosurgical procedures. Gastric mucosal ischaemia due to hypotension and shock is the most important risk factor for stress ulcer bleeding. Preventive strategies aim to reduce gastric acidity (histamine H2 receptor antagonists, antacids), strengthen mucosal defensive mechanisms (sucralfate, antacids, pirenzepine) and normalise gastric mucosal microcirculation (sucralfate, pirenzepine). However, the most important prophylactic measure is an optimised resuscitation and ICU regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation. All drugs approved for stress ulcer prophylaxis in Europe (H2 antagonists, antacids, pirenzepine, sucralfate) have been shown to be effective in prospective controlled randomised trials. However, due to insufficient clinical data, prostaglandins and omeprazole cannot be recommended for this use. Stress ulcer prophylaxis is indicated only in patients at risk, and not in every ICU patient. The selection of drugs today depends not only on efficacy but also on possible adverse effects and on costs. In this regard, the most cost-effective drug is sucralfate. The clinical relevance of nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric bacterial overgrowth has decreased during the past decade due to several changes in the management of critically ill patients.",E,E

Although protrusion of parietal cell cytoplasm is believed to be associated with omeprazole therapy and has been implicated in the histogenesis of fundic gland polyps, we have observed it in a wide variety of different conditions unrelated to peptic ulcer disease or omeprazole therapy. To establish the incidence of PCP and analyze its relationship to gastritis, gland dilatation, cystic change, and fundic gland polyps, we studied 400 gastric mucosal biopsy specimens from gastric ulcer patients who were not receiving omeprazole therapy and who did not receive any medications for at least 2 weeks. Severity of each of these changes was graded on a scale of I to III. PCP was observed in oxyntic mucosal biopsy specimens from 60 (15%) patients and was associated with varying grades of chronic superficial or interstitial gastritis in 25 (Helicobacter pylori was identified in 12). Although chronic atrophic gastritis, cystic change, or fundic gland polyps were not identified in any of the cases with PCP, gland dilatation was present in 25 of 60 (42%) biopsy specimens. No consistent linear correlation was observed between increasing grades of PCP and gastritis or gland dilatation. Our findings of PCP in 15% of gastric ulcer patients who were off all medications for 2 weeks indicate that PCP is not always related to omeprazole usage. It appears to be a change encountered in a wide variety of diverse settings and, therefore, should not be used to monitor omeprazole therapy. In gastric ulcer patients, there is no linear correlation between PCP and gland dilatation or severity of gastritis. The lack of association of PCP with such cardinal features of fundic gland polyps as gland dilatation and cystic change suggests that PCP per se has little if any role in the development of such polyps. The exact clinical and functional significance of PCP remain to be established and merits further investigation.",E,E

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg of rabeprazole once daily during the first treatment period and 40 mg once daily during the second treatment period, or 40 mg during the first treatment period and 20 mg during the second treatment period. The primary efficacy variable was oesophageal acid exposure determined by 24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring. Acid-reflux time was defined as the percentage of time over 24 h that oesophageal pH was < 4. A dosage was considered effective if reflux time was reduced to < 6%, a number which has been our internal laboratory reference.; Both rabeprazole 20 mg and 40 mg, given once daily, normalized reflux time, with decreases of 79% and 92% in acid exposure by day 7. Both dosages also decreased the mean total number of reflux episodes and the number of episodes lasting > 5 min, with no significant differences between dosages for any reflux parameter. Mean gastric pH increased with 20 mg from 1.86 at baseline to 3.71 on day 1 and 4.17 on day 7. Rabeprazole 40 mg once daily increased gastric pH from 2.01 to 4.37 on day 1, and to 4.65 on day 7. Safety analyses revealed no significant acute side-effects for either dosage.; Pathological oesophageal acid exposure was normalized with both 20 mg and 40 mg dosages of rabeprazole, and the effects of these two doses did not differ. Rabeprazole was well-tolerated in this short-term study.",I,E

Omeprazole can suppress gastric acid remarkably and may be beneficial for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding.; Fifty-two patients with a non-bleeding visible vessel at the ulcer base were enrolled and randomized into four groups (N = 13 in each group). In the cimetidine group, the patients received cimetidine 300 mg i.v. bolus followed by 300 mg i.v. every 6 hr during hospitalization. In the heater probe thermocoagulation + cimetidine group, the patients received heater probe thermocoagulation and cimetidine 300 mg i.v. bolus followed by 300 mg i.v. every 6 h during hospitalization. In the omeprazole q.d. group, the patients received omeprazole 40 mg i.v. bolus followed by 40 mg i.v. daily for two days. In the omeprazole q 12 h group, the patients received omeprazole 40 mg i.v. bolus followed by 40 mg i.v. every 12 h for two days. A 24 hr intragastric pH was recorded for every case.; The mean 24 hr intragastric pH were higher in the omeprazole q.d. (mean 5.8) and the omeprazole q 12 h groups (mean 6.4) than in the cimetidine (mean 4.3) and the heater probe thermocoagulation + cimetidine groups (mean 4.9) (p < 0.05). Rebleeding occurred in 5, 2, 2 and 2 patients in the cimetidine, heater probe thermocoagulation + cimetidine, omeprazole q.d., and omeprazole q 12 h groups, respectively (p > 0.05). Volume of blood transfusion and number of days in hospital were not statistically different among the four groups.; Omeprazole can remarkably suppress gastric acid when it is compared to that of the H2 receptor blocker. Patients with a non-bleeding visible vessel using omeprazole do not exhibit a decrease in the rebleeding rate as compared with those patients using cimetidine.",E,E

Fortunately, many groups are now addressing GER specifically in relation to children. Abnormalities in gastrointestinal motility are described in gastroesophageal reflux GER, and there are several new studies looking at this issue in infantile GER. An international working group has put together recommendations for management of infantile GER. The results of a large pediatric study using omeprazole and a review of the use of the prokinetic cisapride in pediatrics are summarized. Several papers review recent experiences with laparoscopic fundoplication. New diagnostic modalities used to investigate GER in infants and children are discussed. These studies aid in both our understanding of possible pathogenesis of GER as well as treatment of the young patient with GER.",E,E

Patients with reflux esophagitis grade 0 or 1 were included in the study and were randomized to double-blind treatment with either 40 mg omeprazole or placebo o.m. The effect of treatment was evaluated after 1 and 2 wk with a symptom questionnaire with a four-grade Likert scale, and symptomatic response outcome was compared with the results of 24-h pH-metry.; Ninety-eight patients were included; however, 13 were excluded from the final analysis because of protocol violation. Of the remaining 85 patients, 54 had no signs of esophagitis at endoscopy, and 31 had esophagitis grade 1. The pH registration showed pathological gastroesophageal reflux in 47 patients (55%). Forty-one patients were randomized to treatment with omeprazole and 44 to placebo.

The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of H. pylori eradication in the large cohort of asymptomatic patients receiving maintenance antisecretory therapy for a previously documented peptic ulcer disease.; A decision analytic model estimated the clinical and economic effects of two management strategies for asymptomatic patients receiving maintenance antisecretory therapy for a previously documented peptic ulcer: strategy 1-immediate H. pylori eradication therapy and cessation of maintenance therapy, and strategy 2-continued-maintenance antisecretory therapy, with H. pylori eradication therapy reserved for the first symptom recurrence.; At 1 yr, the model estimated that immediate H. pylori eradication therapy (strategy 1) led to 22% fewer months with ulcers (28.7 vs. 36.8 ulcer months/100 patient years), 10% fewer months with ulcer symptoms (21.0 vs. 23.1 symptom months/100 patient years), and 24% lower per-patient expenditures ($587 vs. $767/patient year) than maintenance antisecretory therapy and symptom-based H. pylori eradication (strategy 2). Immediate H. pylori eradication, however, resulted in 14% more months with upper gastrointestinal symptoms from all causes (37.9 vs. 33.2 symptom months/100 patient years) than strategy 2, because maintenance antisecretory therapy was effective in treating symptoms due to causes other than peptic ulcer disease.; Ulcer-related outcomes of asymptomatic patients receiving maintenance antisecretory agents for peptic ulcer disease can be improved with immediate H. pylori eradication at reduced cost. Therefore, H. pylori eradication should be aggressively pursued in all patients-symptomatic or not-with previously documented peptic ulcers, who are receiving maintenance antisecretory therapy.",I,E

Analyses were performed using (1) both evaluable patients (n = 1527) and all randomized patients (n = 1655) (assuming that patients lost to follow-up were treatment failures); (2) all studies and a subset of studies that received high methodologic quality scores; and (3) fixed-effects, random-effects, and Bayesian statistical models. In all cases, lansoprazole was associated with a significantly higher rate of endoscopic healing at both 4 and 8 weeks compared with the H2RAs. When the most conservative Bayesian statistical model and intent-to-treat analysis were used, lansoprazole was associated with a 33% higher healing rate at 4 weeks (risk ratio = 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to 1.49) and a 12% higher healing rate at 8 weeks (risk ratio = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.19) than were the H2RA agents. Similar results were obtained when the meta-analysis was performed on evaluable rather than all randomized patients and using the three different analytical techniques noted above. Slightly lower, though still highly significant, improvement in ulcer healing rates was obtained when the meta-analysis was performed using a subset of six studies that received high methodologic quality scores. These results support the conclusion that lansoprazole heals ulcers more quickly than do the H2RAs and also achieves higher overall rates of healing.

Testing for cure was done by endoscopy in study 1 and by breath test in study 2.; Cure rates per protocol were 31 of 31 (100%) in study 1 and 30 of 32 (94%) in study 2. Intention-to-treat cure rates were 31 of 35 (89%) in study 1 and 30 of 32 (94%) in study 2. Cured overall were 32 of 34 with a metronidazole sensitive strain and 3 of 3 with a metronidazole-resistant strain. Data on side effects were collected from 51 patients. Twelve (21%) had no side effects, 27 (53%) had mild side effects, 10 (20%) had moderate side effects, but only 2 (4%) had severe side effects. Side effects, never were the reason that a patient stopped taking the medication.; The results with lansoprazole-quadruple therapy are comparable to the historic control group treated with omeprazole-quadruple therapy. The cure rare is very high, and although mild to moderate side effects occurred in many patients, everybody finished the treatment regime.",I,E

In these patients symptom relief and patient satisfaction with therapy are of fundamental importance. Cisapride has well-documented prokinetic effects and may be well suited for long-term therapy of GORD, but its effectiveness in purely symptomatic treatment is unknown. We therefore compared two dosage regimens of cisapride with placebo over a period of 6 months in patients with evidence of gastrooesophageal reflux, initially treated with antisecretory medication, with regard to maintaining symptom relief and satisfaction with treatment.; Five hundred and thirty-five patients with reflux oesophagitis grade 1 (n = 293) or 2 (n = 124) or with no reflux oesophagitis but pathologic 24-h pH-metry (n = 118) achieved satisfactory symptom relief with an H2-receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor within 4-8 weeks. In a double-blind randomized, parallel-group study, they were then treated with cisapride, 20 mg at night or 20 mg twice daily, or placebo and followed up for a maximum period of 6 months. Relapse was defined as dissatisfaction with therapy or an average consumption of more than two antacid tablets a day.; Median time to relapse was 63 days for cisapride, 20 mg twice daily; 59 days for cisapride, 20 mg at night; and 49 days for placebo. Time to relapse was not significantly different (P = 0.09). Presence and grade of oesophagitis at base line, type of therapy before randomization, and pattern of non-reflux symptoms at base line did not influence these findings significantly.; The study indicates that cisapride is of limited value in maintenance therapy of GORD in patients in whom symptom relief has been accomplished with potent antisecretory medication. This 'step-down' approach to therapy seems disadvantageous in the long-term therapy of GORD.",3,E

If maintenance therapy must be provided, the most cost-effective treatment strategy should be established. We evaluated the costs and benefits associated with three treatment strategies: 1) maintenance therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) strategy, 2) maintenance therapy with a high-dose histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) strategy, and 3) maintenance therapy with a standard-dose H2RA. If patients experience a symptomatic recurrence on the H2RA strategies, they then receive PPI maintenance.; We used a cost-effectiveness model with a 1-yr time frame; data were obtained from randomized trials of lansoprazole and ranitidine, from case series, and expert opinion.; In most situations, the high-dose H2RA strategy is the most costly, yet it is less effective than the PPI strategy. Among the remaining two options, the PPI strategy is more costly and more effective than the standard-dose H2RA strategy, requiring an additional $52-688 per recurrence prevented, depending on drug acquisition costs. The greater the degree to which esophagitis decreases quality of life, the more cost effective is the PPI strategy. For example, with a $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year cost-effectiveness threshold and a market-weighted average of drug costs, the PPI strategy appears cost effective for those patients who report that symptoms of esophagitis cause greater than a 9% decrement in quality of life.; The high-dose H2RA strategy is not preferred in terms of either costs or benefits. The PPI strategy appears cost effective relative to the standard-dose H2RA strategy in the following situations: when patients are significantly bothered by esophagitis and in institutional settings where the difference in drug costs between PPIs and H2RAs is small.",I,E

According to their data, H. pylori infection is quite frequent among patients with a variety of gastric conditions, including adults (43%-92%) and children (6%-100%). Levels of specific IgG antibodies to H. pylori are also elevated among patients with duodenal ulcers (100%) and gastritis (86%) as well as asymptomatic adults (75%). Combination therapy with three (but not two) drugs has been proved effective, with clinical improvement, ulcer cure, and H. pylori eradication occurring in well-controlled studies. Available evidence suggests that antibiotic resistance is not a major problem in treatment. The H. pylori reinfection rate is low (4.2% per year), suggesting that combination therapy with three drugs constitutes a cost-effective alternative for treating colonized symptomatic patients. Concurrent preliminary studies revealed that antibodies to VacA but not CagA proteins correlate with disease severity in Chilean patients. It can be concluded that local research assists local administrators of health resources to implement adequate policies to prevent, control, and treat H. pylori-related pathologies.",E,E

The standard dose of clarithromycin is 250 mg twice daily.; In a prospective study designed to evaluate the helicobactericidal efficacy, patient acceptability, and ulcer healing efficacy of a triple therapy regimen incorporating high dose clarithromycin, 100 consecutive patients with H. pylori-positive peptic ulcer received omeprazole 20 mg twice daily in combination with metronidazole 400 mg twice daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for seven days. H. pylori status was assessed before and at least 4 weeks after therapy by rapid urease test and histology. Adverse events and compliance were assessed by direct questioning.; Only two patients failed to attend for repeat endoscopy, leaving 98 evaluable patients. Of these, 94 were H. pylori-negative after therapy, giving an intention-to-treat eradication rate of 94% (95% confidence interval, 89%-99%). The ulcer healing rate was 92% (86%-98%), and ulcer healing was significantly associated with H. pylori eradication (p < 0.01). Adverse events were reported by 33% of patients of which nausea was the commonest (14%). Noncompliance with therapy was significantly associated with H. pylori treatment failure (p < 0.001).; Seven day triple therapy incorporating high dose clarithromycin effectively eradicates H. pylori and heals ulcers, but it is disadvantaged by a relatively high rate of adverse events. In view of these findings and the fact that no direct comparison to date has shown increased efficacy from high dose clarithromycin, we would recommend continued use of low dose clarithromycin when combined with omeprazole and a nitroimidazole.",E,E

Ranitidine use was associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk of developing any infectious complication (37 of 47 vs. 26 of 47; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 2.28). Infectious complications totaled 128 in the ranitidine-treated group and 50 in the sucralfate-treated group (p = 0.0014). These differences remained after excluding catheter-related infections (p = 0.0042) and secondary bacteremia (p = 0.0046).; Ranitidine use in severely injured patients is associated with a statistically significant increase in overall infectious complications when compared with sucralfate. These results indicate that ranitidine should be avoided where possible in the prophylaxis of stress gastritis.",E,E

However, the optimal therapeutic combination has not yet been identified. Bismuth-containing regimens have the advantage of requiring only one antibiotic. It has been suggested that high doses of omeprazole improve the bactericidal efficacy of antimicrobial regimens against H. pylori. We evaluated the efficacy of two 1-wk triple-therapy regimens for H. pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer healing.; On an intention-to-treat basis, 182 patients with H. pylori-associated duodenal ulcer were randomized. Group OCB patients (n = 91) were given omeprazole 40 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and colloidal bismuth subcitrate 120 mg q.i.d. for 7 days. Group OCA patients (n = 91) were treated with omeprazole and clarithromycin at the same doses plus amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d., also for 7 days. Endoscopies were performed at entry and at 4 wk after the end of treatment. The presence of H. pylori was assessed by urease test, histology, Gram stain, and culture. No patient received follow-up treatment.; H. pylori eradication rates achieved in the OCB and OCA groups were similar whether by intention-to-treat (82.4% vs 88.9% ;p = 0.21) or per protocol analysis (83.3% vs 89.9%; p = 0.19). Duodenal ulcer healing rates also were the same for OCB and OCA in intention-to treat (91.2% vs 91.1%) and per protocol analysis (92.2% vs 92.1%), respectively (p = 0.98).; High rates of H. pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer healing were obtained with both short-treatment regimens, which were safe and well-tolerated. Colloidal bismuth subcitrate seems to be a good alternative to amoxicillin in the triple-therapy combination with omeprazole and clarithromycin. The omeprazole dose does not seem to play a major role in H. pylori eradication in these therapeutic combinations.",E,E

Amongst the races, Chinese and Indians had similar rates of seropositivity (34.3% and 33.6%) while in Malays it was significantly lower (13.7%; P < 0.05). H. pylori infection is associated with peptic ulcer disease (both duodenal and gastric ulcer) as well as gastric cancer [adenocarcinoma, early gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoma of T cell type (MALT) lymphoma]. Its role in non-ulcer dyspepsia is controversial. H. pylori was found in 31% of non-ulcer dyspepsia patients in Singapore compared with 28% in normal healthy controls. Gastric emptying test using indigestible solids shows that gastroparesis per se, H. pylori in the presence of gastroparesis (but not H. pylori alone) are related to dyspeptic symptom. H. pylori plays a synergistic role with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in causing bleeding in gastric ulcer but not in duodenal ulcer. Invasive and non-invasive methods are available for diagnosis of H. pylori and should be used to establish the aetiology of gastro-duodenal disease. Currently two groups of therapeutic regimes with eradication rates of 90% are available: bismuth containing regimes and proton-pump inhibitors based regimes. Triple therapy for one week (using three drugs effective against H. pylori) is currently the treatment of choice.",E,E

Adverse effects of this regimen were observed in 5 (2.9%) of the 173 patients. Diarrhea was observed in 3 patients and eruption in 2. These adverse effects disappeared within a few days after only AMPC was withdrawn. Therefore, these may be caused by AMPC. The eradication rate of H. pylori depends on the period of AMPC treatment. This regiment, AMPC (1.5g/day) + omeprazole (20mg/day) + plaunotol (240mg/day), is safe and well tolerated for eradication of H. pylori.",E,E

Unfortunately such an approach does not necessarily identify the therapeutic option which provides the greatest benefit from available resources in real life situations. To make an informed choice requires a recognition that the costs and benefits of therapy in practice may differ from those identified in trials.; To evaluate, based on a retrospective prescription database analysis, the cost effectiveness of alternative treatment options for patients with uncomplicated GORD. The analysis assesses health service resource use during the first six months of treatment in three groups of patients initially prescribed cisapride (CIS), ranitidine (RAN), or omeprazole (OME).; The MediPlus UK database was used to identify all health care resources consumed by patients in the three treatment groups during their first six months of treatment. Patients with more complicated GORD, as indicated by initial referral to a specialist or outpatient hospital visit (< 13%), were excluded from the analysis.; The average cost per patient for the initial six months of treatment for CIS, RAN, and OME based therapies was 136 Pounds, 177 Pounds, 189 Pounds per patient, respectively. A major element underlying this cost variation was the acquisition cost and quantity of antireflux medication required by patients. The average number of one month equivalent prescriptions consumed during this six month period was 1.85 (CIS), 2.57 (RAN), and 2.96 (OME) with associated costs of 49 Pounds (CIS), 67 Pounds (RAN), and 105 Pounds (OME). Antacid and alginate/antacid use was higher in the CIS and RAN groups (about 1.0 antacid prescription per patient versus 0.4 for OME), but their contribution to the total cost per patient was less than 2%. The number of general practitioner consultations over the six month period for each treatment group was 2.4 (CIS), 2.9 (RAN), and 2.6 (OME) with associated costs of 60.31 Pounds (CIS), 73.06 Pounds (RAN), and 65.52 Pounds (OME). The average number of non-drug interventions (referrals, outpatient visits, endoscopies, barium meals, or x rays) was 0.34 in the RAN group compared with less than 0.2 in the CIS and OME groups. The costs associated with such interventions were 23.80 Pounds (RAN), 9.60 Pounds (CIS), and 11.10 Pounds (OME) per patient.; The data indicate that the ""step up"" approach, starting with a prokinetic or H2 receptor antagonist, represents the most cost effective initial therapeutic strategy for a primary care physician to adopt when faced with a patient with first diagnosis of uncomplicated GORD.",E,E

In vitro animal experiments have indicated that the inhibition of the proton pump by rabeprazole is partially reversible. Rabeprazole has 2- to 10-fold greater antisecretory activity than omeprazole in vitro. However, it dissociates more readily from H+,K(+)-ATPase than omeprazole, resulting in a shorter duration of action. In comparative clinical trials rabeprazole was significantly more effective than placebo, famotidine or ranitidine and as effective as omeprazole in the treatment of patients with erosive or ulcerative gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or gastric or duodenal ulcers. Healing rates with rabeprazole were independent of Helicobacter pylori status. Rabeprazole in combination with either clarithromycin and metronidazole or clarithromycin and amoxicillin or amoxicillin and metronidazole or clarithromycin for 7 days produced eradication of H. pylori in 100, 95, 90 and 63% of patients.

Until now, shorter regimens have scarcely been investigated. Azithromycin is a new generation macrolide antibiotic with unusual and favorable pharmacokinetics, and seems to be a very promising agent for innovative anti-H. pylori regimens. We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of a new 4-day low dose triple therapy in comparison with a well established 1-wk triple therapy in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.; One hundred-sixty consecutive patients with biopsy-proven H. pylori infection were randomized to receive lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. on days 1-4, azithromycin 500 mg u.i.d. on days 2-4, and tinidazole 2000 mg u.i.d. on day 3 (LAT group), or 7 days of triple therapy of omeprazole 20 mg u.i.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.i.d., and tinidazole 500 mg b.i.d. (OCT group). Patients with gastric or duodenal active ulcer received proton pump inhibitors for an additional 4 wk. H. pylori eradication was defined as negative of both rapid urease test and histology on biopsies taken from the gastric body and antrum at least 1 month after the end of treatment.; Seven patients in the LAT group and four in the OCT group were lost to follow-up. No significant difference in either efficacy or tolerability was observed between the two regimens. Active ulcers healed in 97.8% of cases with LAT and in 100% of cases with OCT. The eradication rate was 80.8% in the LAT group and 85.5% in the OCT group, considering the per-protocol results, and 73.3% and 81.2%, respectively, considering the intention-to-treat results. Side effects occurred in one LAzT patient and in two OCT patients; they were mild and did not interfere with compliance.; The new proposed ultrashort triple therapy, including lansoprazole, low dose azithromycin for 3 days, and a single dose of tinidazole, appears to be a very effective anti-H. pylori regimen, a simpler, cheaper, well-tolerated, and equally effective alternative to 1-wk triple therapy.",E,E

We found that whether or not antibody to H. pylori was present, pepsinogen I and II levels and the I/II ratio rose significantly in lansoprazole-treated patients. Patients with stomach-body ulcers showed smaller increases in both pepsinogens than did those with ulcers in the gastric angle/antrum or in the duodenum. In conclusion, lansoprazole increases serum levels of both pepsinogens I and II, although a larger increase in pepsinogen I elevates the pepsinogen I/II ratio. The relatively small increases seen in patients with stomach-body ulcers suggest atrophic changes in the gastric mucosa in patients with stomach-body ulcer.",E,E

One month later, all received four weeks treatment with omeprazole 40 mg/day for one month followed by 20 mg/day for six months. Serum gastrin concentrations were measured before and following each treatment.; In the patients randomised to anti-H pylori treatment, eradication of the infection lowered median fasting gastrin by 48% and meal stimulated gastrin by 46%. When gastrin concentrations one month following anti-H pylori/symptomatic treatment were used as baseline, omeprazole treatment produced a similar percentage increase in serum gastrin in the H pylori infected and H pylori eradicated patients. Consequently, in the patients in which H pylori was not eradicated, median fasting gastrin concentration was 38 ng/l (range 26-86) at initial presentation and increased to 64 ng/l (range 29-271) after seven months omeprazole, representing a median increase of 68% (p < 0.005).

In each of the three 7-day treatment periods either omeprazole (20 mg), lansoprazole (30 mg) or pantoprazole (40 mg) in therapeutically recommended doses was administered once daily, and the pharmacokinetics of the proton pump inhibitors as well as the rate of caffeine metabolism was measured on days 1 and 7.; In the EMs there was an increase in AUC from day 1 to day 7 for omeprazole. In the PMs the AUC of both omeprazole and lansoprazole was unchanged during repeated dosing, while for pantoprazole there was a tendency to a slight decrease. The AUC at steady state was for all three proton pump inhibitors 5 fold higher in PMs compared with EMs, indicating that the same proportion of the dose, irrespective of compound, is metabolized by CYP2C19. No induction of CYP1A2 was evident for any of the compounds in either EMs or PMs.; The approximately 5 fold difference in AUC between EMs and PMs indicates that approximately 80% of the dose for all three proton pump inhibitors is metabolized by the polymorphically expressed CYP2C19. None of the three proton pump inhibitors, administered in therapeutically recommended doses, is an inducer of CYP1A2--neither in PMs nor in EMs.",E,E

The subjects were 364 patients aged between 18 and 64 years who had been prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) by general practitioners in Oxfordshire. The general practices participating identified patients who had been prescribed PPIs. The data were abstracted from the general practice medical records of these patients concerning gastrointestinal diagnoses and other prescribed medications. The patients were sent the SF-36 questionnaire by post and the PCS and MCS scores were derived, which were adjusted for age and sex and compared with the scores of the general population of the Oxford region. Co-morbidity was assessed by the extent to which non-gastric medications were also used. The commonest diagnoses were oesophagitis/gastro-oesophageal reflux and indigestion. People with these diagnoses had significantly lower health status than the general population. Differences persisted when the results were controlled for the possible effects of co-morbidity.

Between January 1996 and March 1997, 67 patients with persistent H. pylori infection after a 2-week course of dual therapy (amoxicillin plus omeprazole) were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to receive amoxicillin (1000 mg twice daily) and omeprazole (20 mg twice daily) plus either metronidazole (500 mg twice daily) or clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily). Endoscopy was performed in each patient to assess the status of H. pylori using the rapid urease test (CLOtest) and the histologic findings before dual therapy, after dual therapy, and after triple therapy. H. pylori isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance when triple therapy failed. The 1-week triple therapy was well tolerated in both groups with no adverse effects severe enough to cause withdrawal from the trial. Residual H. pylori was eradicated in 94% (33/35) of patients in the clarithromycin group and 84% (27/32) in the metronidazole group; the difference was not statistically significant. All seven patients in whom triple therapy failed were infected with metronidazole-resistant isolates and two also had clarithromycin-resistant isolates. This 1-week triple therapy is safe and effective in eradicating residual H. pylori after dual therapy failure. Failure of the rescue regimen is related to antimicrobial agent resistance. Because of the high metronidazole resistance rate in Taiwan, clarithromycin appears to be more promising than metronidazole for the control of H. pylori.",3,E

The addition of the 13C-urea breath test and a second course of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole achieved the highest eradication rate (97%) but was the most expensive (62.63 pounds per patient). The cost of each additional effective eradication was 589.00 pounds (incremental cost per case) when compared with the cost of treating once only with omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole; equivalent to the cost of a patient receiving ranitidine for duodenal ulcer relapse for more than 15 years. Eradication strategies of omeprazole, amoxycillin, and metronidazole were less cost effective than omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole alone. In model 2 the addition of the 13C-urea breath test after treatment, and maintenance treatment, increased the cost of all the strategies and reduced the cost advantage of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole alone.; Small differences in efficacy can influence the comparative cost effectiveness of strategies for eradicating H pylori. Of the strategies tested the most cost effective (omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole alone) was neither the least expensive (omeprazole, amoxycillin, and metronidazole alone) nor the most effective (omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole with further treatment for patients found positive for H pylori on 13C-urea breath testing).

On 22 October 1982, at a meeting of the Royal Australian College of Physicians, successful culture of these 'Campylobacterlike organisms' from gastric biopsy specimens was reported for the first time. Moreover, it was shown that their presence was associated with gastritis and, possibly, with peptic ulceration. The subsequent discovery of the pivotal role of Helicobacter pylori in a wide range of conditions has revolutionised our understanding of gastroduodenal diseases. Improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic options, combined with the gradual acceptance of the aetiological role of an infective agent in peptic disease, have led to a remarkable change in the management of gastroduodenal conditions in the past decade.",E,E

However, reports of ventricular proarrhythmia have been noted in patients taking cisapride, particularly in conjunction with other drugs that may inhibit hepatic metabolism of cisapride via the cytochrome P450 3A4 system.; We designed a prospective, blinded study to evaluate the effect of cisapride on ventricular repolarization in children with GERD.; We analyzed the electrocardiograms (ECGs) from 35 children (age 0.4 to 18 years, mean 5.2 years) including measurement of the resting QT interval (QTc), JT interval (JTc), as well as QT and JT interlead dispersion markers. Data from these patients were compared with ECGs from a control group of 1000 normal children.; Eleven (31%) of 35 patients receiving cisapride had a prolonged QTc (> or = 450 ms). The JTc was prolonged > or = 360 ms in 16 of 35 patients (46%). The mean QTc in the cisapride group was 428 +/- 35 ms and mean JTc was 336 +/- 35 ms. An increased QT or JT dispersion (> 70 ms) was seen in only 3 of 35 children. Of the 11 children with QTc prolongation, 2 had documented torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia. Both patients were taking cisapride concomitantly with a macrolide antibiotic. All other patients were treated with either cisapride alone or in conjunction with other GERD agents, such as ranitidine or omeprazole.; Cisapride may cause prolongation of ventricular repolarization in children. There does not appear to be increased heterogeneity of repolarization or delayed depolarization in this small sample. The proarrhythmia may be exacerbated by medications that inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 hepatic metabolism, overdosage, or mechanisms that result in decreased serum clearance. ECG intervals should be monitored in children maintained on cisapride, particularly when used in combination with other known QT-prolonging medications.",E,E

Resolution of dyspepsia was therefore a powerful predictor of eradication of H pylori with a predictive value of 98%. In contrast, persistence of dyspepsia was a weak predictor of persisting infection with a predictive value of only 25%. Excluding patients with endoscopic evidence of coexisting oesophagitis and/or retrosternal discomfort or reflux at initial presentation did not increase the predictive value of persisting dyspepsia for persisting infection.; Complete resolution of dyspeptic symptoms is a powerful predictor of eradication of H pylori infection in ulcer patients.

Individuals found to be H. pylori-positive at endoscopy received 1 week of proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy. H. pylori-negative individuals received therapy tailored to their diagnosis. Endoscopy was repeated in the positive group to confirm successful eradication. Results were analysed according to our strategy, i.e. serologically-positive patients would have received eradication therapy without endoscopy, but patients found to be negative would have been referred for endoscopy.; According to the serology test there were 39 positive and 33 negative results. Symptoms failed to resolve during follow-up in nine of the serological positives despite successful eradication. There were also five false positives who were deemed likely treatment failures. Thus according to our strategy, these 14 serologically-positive patients would ultimately have required an endoscopy and the other 25 serologically-positive patients would have avoided an endoscopy, resulting in a 35% reduction in endoscopy usage in this population.

No cases of gastric malignancy were detected at endoscopy. Thus our strategy would have reduced initial endoscopy referrals by 35% in this selected population.; A strategy of empirical H. pylori eradication therapy can safely reduce the requirement for endoscopy in young dyspeptic patients without sinister symptoms.",E,E

As input the method requires: the expected difference and variance of costs and effects, their correlation, the significance level (alpha) and the power of the testing method and the maximum acceptable ratio of incremental effectiveness to incremental costs. The method is illustrated with data from two trials. The first compares primary coronary angioplasty with streptokinase in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, in the second trial, lansoprazole is compared with omeprazole in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis. These case studies show how the various parameters influence the sample size. Given the large number of parameters that have to be specified in advance, the lack of knowledge about costs and their standard deviation, and the difficulty of specifying the maximum acceptable ratio of incremental effectiveness to incremental costs, the conclusion of the study is that from a technical point of view it is possible to perform a sample size calculation for an economic evaluation, but one should wonder how useful it is.",E,E

Patients with duodenal ulcer were randomized to two treatment groups: group A received either ranitidine 4 x 150 mg or tetracycline 4 x 500 mg or metronidazole 3 x 250 mg for 2 weeks. Group B received 4 x placebo + tetracycline and metronidazole as in group A for 2 weeks. A final endoscopy was performed after 8 weeks. Four biopsy specimens were obtained from the antrum (two) and corpus (two) for both urease test and hematoxylin stain for detection of H. pylori. Out of 201 patients entering the study 156 completed the study (78 in A and 78 in B). The healing rate of duodenal ulcer was 98.7% in group A and 97.5 in group B. The eradication rate was only 33.3% in group B but 64% in group A (p < 0.001), when additionally ranitidine was given. The present study shows that treatment with the two antibiotics tetracycline and metronidazole alone results in a very low H. pylori eradication, but almost complete healing of duodenal ulcer after 8 weeks.

Twelve patients with severe hypergastrinaemia (gastrin > 400 ng/L) were compared with 14 control patients (gastrin < 300 ng/L). Helicobacter pylori serology and a laboratory screen were obtained in all patients. Gastric emptying was scored by the evidence of food remnants upon endoscopy 12 h after a standardized meal. Gastric antrum and corpus biopsies were analysed for histological parameters, as well as somatostatin and gastrin concentrations. All patients underwent a meal-stimulated gastrin test and the hypergastrinaemia patients also underwent a vagal nerve integrity assessment by pancreatic polypeptide testing (PPT).; Severe hypergastrinaemia patients had a longer duration of treatment (80 vs. 55 months; P = 0.047) and were characterized by a higher prevalence of H. pylori infection (9/12 vs. 2/14, P = 0.004), corpus mucosal inflammation and atrophic gastritis (P < 0.04). This was reflected in lower serum pepsinogen A concentrations (mean +/- S.E.M. 53.6 +/- 17.9 vs. 137 +/- 16.0 mg/L, P = 0.03), pepsinogen A/C ratio (1.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.1 +/- 0.6, P = 0.005) and mucosal somatostatin concentrations (2.75 +/- 0.60 vs. 4.48 +/- 1.08 mg/g protein, P = 0.038).

Patients were treated with various combinations of omeprazole and amoxycillin. Ulcer healing and H. pylori eradication were assessed. For patients whose duodenal ulcer healed, duodenal ulcer recurrence was determined over a 6-month period in patients with H. pylori eradication and those remaining positive for H. pylori at least 4 weeks after treatment. To support the data obtained from these clinical trials, a search of the medical literature was conducted to identify additional human clinical trials in which duodenal ulcer recurrence rates were measured and categorized by H. pylori status at least 1 month post-treatment.; In 11 controlled trials, the overall 6-18-month duodenal ulcer recurrence rate was 54% among patients remaining positive for H. pylori at least 4 weeks after treatment compared to 6% among patients with H. pylori eradication following treatment. This finding was corroborated by the uncontrolled trials, in which the duodenal ulcer recurrence rate was 64% among patients found to be H. pylori-positive and 6% for patients found to be H. pylori-negative at least 4 weeks after treatment. A time course of duodenal ulcer recurrence rates using pooled data from both controlled and uncontrolled studies demonstrated that duodenal ulcer recurrence rates for H. pylori-negative patients persisted for up to 4 years following treatment. Duodenal ulcer recurrence rates for H. pylori-positive patients increased for the first year, then levelled off. A comparison of the duodenal ulcer recurrence rates for different treatment regimens revealed that eradication regimens based on omeprazole plus antibiotics and bismuth plus antibiotics exhibited similar duodenal ulcer recurrence rates for H. pylori-positive and -negative patients.; Regardless of treatment regimens, H. pylori eradication produced a consistent and significant reduction in duodenal ulcer recurrence. Therefore H. pylori eradication, 4 weeks post-therapy, can be used as a surrogate marker for reduced duodenal ulcer recurrence in investigational clinical trials.",E,E

Rabeprazole (E3810) is a new substituted benzimidazole H+,K+ ATPase inhibitor. It acts as an irreversible, non-competitive inhibitor of the H+,K+ ATPase and preliminary studies demonstrate that rabeprazole produces a potent and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion and a low level of hypergastrinaemia.; This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to further examine the effects of different single doses of rabeprazole on gastric acid secretion and serum gastrin.; In this study, four groups of 10 healthy, non-smoking Helicobacter pylori-negative men (mean age 22.5 +/- 3.9 years) received single oral doses of 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg of rabeprazole. Two of the 10 volunteers in each group received placebo as part of the double-blind study design. All volunteers who entered into the study had a normal gastric acid secretory capacity as evaluated by pentagastrin challenge. Prior to administration of the first dose of test drug, volunteers underwent an inpatient 24-h measurement of baseline intragastric pH. One week later, volunteers received the test drug and again underwent an inpatient 24-h measurement of intragastric pH. During both periods, plasma samples were collected at specified intervals over 48 h and were sent for analysis of rabeprazole and gastrin levels.; Administration of rabeprazole resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the duration and extent of intragastric pH elevation. The response among all volunteers receiving drug was significantly different from placebo, with greater acid inhibition occurring in the 30 and 40 mg groups. In addition, there was also a dose-related increase in plasma gastrin. The pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole were similar to those of other proton pump inhibitors with a t1/2 of between 0.7 and 1.0 h. There were no clinically significant effects on patient laboratory tests or serious adverse events.; The results of this study suggest that rabeprazole is as potent as omeprazole and lansoprazole in inhibiting gastric acid secretion.",E,E

Unfortunately, these findings cannot be predicted based on symptoms alone and require endoscopy for an accurate diagnosis. Noninvasive diagnosis of other gastrointestinal pathology by radiopharmaceuticals (GA 67, Tc 99m pertechnetate) has previously been studied. We hypothesized that endoscopically documented esophagitis and/or gastric erosions could also be detected by using dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging and, if they were of sufficient accuracy, could serve as a useful, noninvasive screening test for esophagitis and/or gastric erosions.; A pilot study was undertaken in 12 patients undergoing endoscopy for symptoms of GERD or dyspepsia. Esophagitis was defined as the presence of either erosions or ulceration and gastric erosions were defined as discrete mucosal breaks measuring > or = 1 mm. Dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging was performed the following day on all 12 patients. A standard dose of dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg) was infused over 4 min, followed by a 3-mCi dose of thallium-201. Initial stress tomographic images and reinjection (1 mCi) resting tomographic images 3-4 h later were obtained using a gamma camera. Tomographic images were read blinded to the endoscopy results. Thallium-201 uptake was graded on a 0-3+ scale using the liver uptake as the internal comparative standard (2+ = uptake equal to the liver). Abnormal thallium uptake was defined as > or = 2+ in the area of the esophagus or stomach.; Seven women and five men (mean age 41 yr, range 25-60 yr) were studied. Eight patients were taking histamine-2 receptor antagonists and none were on proton pump inhibitors, or promotility agents. All five patients with endoscopic esophagitis had a positive thallium-201 tomographic image. Seven patients had no evidence of esophagitis, and three had positive thallium-201 tomograms. Dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for esophagitis were 100%, 57%, 63%, and 100%, respectively. All three patients with gastric erosions had positive thallium-201 tomograms. Six of nine patients without gastric erosions had positive tomograms. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of DT 201 gastric erosions were 100%, 33%, 33%, and 100%, respectively.; Dipyridamole thallium-201 tomographic imaging has good sensitivity (100%) in detecting esophagogastric mucosal erosions, but its poor specificity (33-57%) results in an unacceptable accuracy as a screening test. Additionally, the cost of radiopharmaceuticals requires that sensitivity and specificity be at least equal to that of endoscopy for this test to be clinically valuable as a screening test. However, a noninvasive test for these diseases is inherently appealing, and further research in this area seems to be warranted.",3,E

However, when patients present with dyspepsia or epigastric discomfort, more than 80% of patients will not have ulcer disease and empiric treatment of H. pylori is not recommended for these patients. Eradication of H. pylori has not been demonstrated to improve the symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia compared with non-ulcer dyspepsia patients treated with placebo. Therefore, we recommend that patients should first be evaluated for peptic ulcers with endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal series before the diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori. Generally, the treatment of H. pylori should be limited to patients with peptic ulcers, mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, and gastric cancers. Most diagnostic tests for H. pylori, including quantitative IgG antibody, urea breath tests, rapid urease tests (CLO), tests of gastric mucosal biopsies, and staining of gastric mucosal biopsies, have equivalent diagnostic characteristics. Therefore, the choice of diagnostic test for H. pylori should be based on cost, ease of use, and lack of complications. Multiple antibiotic regimens are available for the treatment of H. pylori. Triple antibiotic therapy is the least expensive but has the highest rate of side effects and the least compliance. Combining a proton pump inhibitor with clarithromycin and another antibiotic will eradicate H. pylori with fewer side effects and better compliance but this is the most expensive antibiotic regimen.",E,E

In the present investigation, treatment with omeprazole led to an increase in fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of xenin, gastrin and pepsinogens A and C (P < 0.05, in each instance), whereas somatostatin plasma levels remained unchanged. Because subcutaneous injection of pentagastrin did not raise xenin plasma concentrations, a direct effect of gastrin on xenin production seems unlikely.

9777309,Proton pump inhibitors. Pharmacology and rationale for use in gastrointestinal disorders.,Animals; Enzyme Inhibitors; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Proton Pump Inhibitors,"Richardson, P; Hawkey, C J; Stack, W A","Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are drugs which irreversibly inhibit proton pump (H+/K+ ATPase) function and are the most potent gastric acid-suppressing agents in clinical use. There is now a substantial body of evidence showing improved efficacy of PPIs over the histamine H2 receptor antagonists and other drugs in acid-related disorders. Omeprazole 20 mg/day, lansoprazole 30 mg/day, pantoprazole 40 mg/day or rabeprazole 20 mg/day for 2 to 4 weeks are more effective than standard doses of H2-receptor antagonists in healing duodenal and gastric ulcers. Patients with gastric ulcers should receive standard doses of PPIs as for duodenal ulcers but for a longer time period (4 to 8 weeks). There is no conclusive evidence to support the use of a particular PPI over another for either duodenal or gastric ulcer healing. For Helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulceration, a combination of a PPI and 2 antibacterials will eradicate H. pylori in over 90% of cases and significantly reduce ulcer recurrence. Patients with H. pylori-positive gastric ulcers should be managed similarly. PPIs also have efficacy advantages over ranitidine and misoprostol and are better tolerated than misoprostol in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In endoscopically proven gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, standard daily doses of the PPIs are more effective than H2-receptor antagonists for healing, and patients should receive a 4 to 8 week course of treatment. For severe reflux, with ulceration and/or stricture formation, a higher dose regimen (omeprazole 40 mg, lansoprazole 60 mg, pantoprazole 80 mg or rabeprazole 40 mg daily) appears to yield better healing rates. There is little evidence that PPIs lead to resolution of Barrett's oesophagus or a reduction of subsequent adenocarcinoma development, but PPIs are indicated in healing of any associated ulceration. In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, PPIs have become the treatment of choice for the management of gastric acid hypersecretion.",E,E

A review of its use in Helicobacter pylori infection, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcers induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.","Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Anti-Ulcer Agents; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Humans; Omeprazole","Langtry, H D; Wilde, M I","Omeprazole is a well studied proton pump inhibitor that reduces gastric acid secretion. This review examines its use in Helicobacter pylori infection, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) with or without oesophagitis and gastrointestinal damage caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Optimal omeprazole regimens for anti-H. pylori therapy are those that administer the drug at a dosage of 40 mg/day (in 1 or 2 divided doses) for 7, 10 or 14 days in combination with 2 antibacterial agents. As a component of 3-drug regimens in direct comparative studies, omeprazole was at least as effective as lansoprazole, pantoprazole, bismuth compounds and ranitidine. However, a meta-analysis suggests that triple therapies with omeprazole are more effective than comparable regimens containing ranitidine, lansoprazole or bismuth. Omeprazole also appears to be successful in triple therapy regimens used in children with H. pylori infection. In patients with acute GORD with oesophagitis, omeprazole is at least as effective as lansoprazole or pantoprazole in promoting healing, and superior to ranitidine, cimetidine or cisapride in oesophagitis healing and symptom relief. Omeprazole was similar to lansoprazole and superior to ranitidine in preventing oesophagitis relapse in patients with all grades of oesophagitis, but may be superior to lansoprazole or pantoprazole in patients with more severe disease. More patients with symptomatic GORD without oesophagitis experienced symptom relief after short term treatment with omeprazole than with ranitidine, cisapride or placebo, and symptoms were more readily prevented by omeprazole than by cimetidine or placebo. Omeprazole was effective in healing and relieving symptoms of reflux oesophagitis in children with oesophagitis refractory to histamine H2 receptor antagonists. Omeprazole is superior to placebo in preventing NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage in patients who must continue to take NSAIDs. It is also similar to misoprostol and superior to ranitidine in its ability to heal NSAID-induced peptic ulcers and erosions, and superior to misoprostol, ranitidine or placebo in its ability to prevent relapse. In long and short term studies, omeprazole was well tolerated, with diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, flatulence, abdominal pain and constipation being the most commonly reported adverse events. Usual omeprazole dosages, alone or combined with other agents, are 10 to 40 mg/day for adults and 10 to 20 mg/day for children.; Omeprazole is a well studied and well tolerated agent effective in adults or children as a component in regimens aimed at eradicating H. pylori infections or as monotherapy in the treatment and prophylaxis of GORD with or without oesophagitis or NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage.",I,E

OA (omeprazole 40 mg o. d. and amoxicillin 750 mq q. i. d. for 14 days), OC (omeprazole 40 mg o. d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b. i. d. for 14 days), OT (omeprazole 40 mg o. d. and tetracycline 500 mg q. i. d. for 14 days), OMC (omeprazole 40 mg o. d., metroinidazole 400 mg t. i. d. and clarithromycin 250 mg b. i. d. for seven days). Eradication was defined as negative UBT six weeks after completion of the therapy. In an ""all-patients-treated"" (""per-protocol"") analysis, the eradication rates were: BMT, 91% (93%); OA, 84% (90%); OC, 74% (74%); OT, 24% (24%); and OMC, 90% (93%). Smoking impaired the success of OA and OT (p < 0.05), but the efficacy of the triple regimens was not affected. Omeprazole pretreatment did not influence eradication rates. Thus, highest eradication rates were achieved with the two triple therapies tested. However, OA, given at a daily antibiotic dose of 3 g amoxicillin for 14 d, was also highly effective. After failure of triple therapy, OA was successful in seven of ten patients (70%). The efficacy of OC was lower than that of the triple therapies (p < 0.05). In conclusion, metronidazole- and clarithromycin-based triple therapies are highly effective first line therapies. OA, given at a dose of 3 g per day over 14 days, should be considered as a possible second line therapy, e.g. in retherapy after failed triple therapy.",E,E

The control group consisted of patients treated with standard dual therapy comprising omeprazole and amoxicillin. One hundred and fifty-seven H. pylori infected patients with duodenal ulcers were randomly assigned to receive either a combination of omeprazole 10 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 400 mg (OCM) given three times daily for 10 days (n = 81), or a combination of omeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 1 g (OA) given twice daily for 14 days (n = 76). Prior to treatment and after 2 and 6 weeks, gastric biopsies from the antrum and corpus were obtained for histology and H. pylori culture. H. pylori infection was cured in 97.4% after OCM and in 65.8% after OA in the per-protocol analysis (p < 0.001) (intention-to-treat analysis: 93.4% and 63.2%, respectively). H. pylori was successfully cultured in 122 patients (77%). The overall rate of metronidazole resistance was 19.7% (24/122), no primary resistance to clarithromycin or amoxicillin was found. In the OCM group, all patients infected with metronidazole-sensitive H. pylori strains (n = 51) and those infected with strains of unknown susceptibility to metronidazole (n = 14) were cured (100%), while 77% (10/13) of those harboring metronidazole-resistant strains were cured of the infection (p = 0.36). Side effects leading to premature termination of treatment occurred in 2.5% of the patients in the OCM group and in 1.4% of the OA group.

However, a variety of H. pylori strains exists, with major differences in virulence characteristics which probably account for different clinical symptoms, and the majority of infected subjects remains asymptomatic. Helicobacter pylori infection is correlated with socioeconomic conditions and hygienic circumstances, resulting in an extremely high prevalence in children in developing countries. Commercial screening tests are not capable of separating the more virulent strains (type I with vacuolating toxin VacA and CagA protein) from the less virulent strains (type II, VacA and CagA negative). Type I strains, but not type II, are associated with an increased risk for duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of interaction between these drugs remain unclear. It has been shown that minimal inhibitory concentration values of both antibiotics are considerably lower at neutral pH levels than in an acid environment. Further, omeprazole possesses bacteriostatic activity. To evaluate the significance of these mechanisms we replaced omeprazole with famotidine, a drug which only suppresses acid production, but has no intrinsic antimicrobial activity.; We evaluated the efficacy of a 1-week course of famotidine 80 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1000 mg b.i.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. in a pilot study (20 patients), and then confirmed our results in a larger replication study (87 patients).

However, no strict comparison of the two proton pump inhibitors' effect on acid reflux and gastric acidity has been published. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of LAN and OME on gastroesophageal reflux with simultaneous measurements of gastric acidity in patients with established gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophagitis.; Fourteen patients with endoscopically verified erosive esophagitis and with a pretreatment esophageal 24-h pH measurement showing acid reflux to the esophagus participated in the study.

Before (day 0) and on the last day (day 5) of each treatment period with encapsulated 30 mg LAN or 20 mg OME daily, 24-h intraesophageal and intragastric acidity were measured with antimony electrodes connected to an ambulatory pH recording system.; Ten of 14 patients completed the study. There were no differences in intragastric or intraesophageal acidity or the number of reflux episodes on day 0 between the two treatments. Both LAN and OME treatments increased the median and nocturnal intragastric pH and decreased the 24-h area under the time curve for intragastric acidity significantly and to about the same extent (79% and 69% acid inhibition by LAN and OME, respectively) (NS). However, the percentage of time with pH below 4 in the esophagus was significantly less during LAN treatment (1.92% +/- 2.29; mean +/- standard deviation) than during OME treatment (4.76% +/- 2.88%) on day 5 (P = 0.002). There were also significantly fewer reflux episodes >5 min during treatment with LAN (1.00 +/- 1.33) than with OME (2.90 +/- 2.42) at the end of the treatment period (P = 0.031).; In this study lansoprazole and omeprazole had a comparable effect on gastric acidity in patients with established GERD with esophagitis.

However, subgrouping has proved difficult due to overlap of symptoms between subgroups, and the response to empirical therapy is difficult to predict. We aimed to study whether natural symptom combinations occur in patients seeing general practitioners because of dyspepsia and whether symptom presentation could predict the effect of proton pump inhibitor treatment.; The symptom presentation of 7270 consecutive, unselected patients with dyspepsia in general practice was studied by using principal-components analysis. The relation to the effect of omeprazole was studied in a subsample (n=471) with predominantly reflux-like or ulcer-like dyspepsia being included in a controlled clinical trial of omeprazole versus placebo.; Four principal components (factors), explaining 36% of the total variance, were found. They describe four independent dimensions in the symptoms of dyspepsia that can be interpreted meaningfully as representing A) acid-related disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract, B) irritable bowel disorder, C) dysmotility of the stomach/duodenum, and D) dysmotility of the esophagus. In the subsample the response to proton pump inhibition therapy was associated with high component-A scores, low component-B scores, and low component-C scores. A pocket chart was devised to obtain the component scores easily in new patients.; The analysis identified four characteristic, biologically meaningful dyspepsia components that express independent dimensions in the symptoms of patients with dyspepsia. The symptom scores corresponding to the four components may improve symptom-based diagnosis and thereby empirical therapy. In particular, the association between component scores and the effect of omeprazole suggests that classifying dyspepsia on the basis of these components may focus empirical omeprazole therapy even more.",3,E

The association between colon cancer and cholecystectomy did not differ by gender or race, but it did differ by study area, with most of the increased association being attributed to the Minnesota population. The elevated risk of proximal colon cancer increased after cholecystectomy but disappeared after 14 years.; Our results suggest that cholecystectomy or the underlying gallstone disease that prompts it may be related weakly to the risk of subsequent proximal colon cancer.
