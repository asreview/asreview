10024334,Irbesartan reduces QT dispersion in hypertensive individuals.,"Aged; Amlodipine; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Antihypertensive Agents; Biphenyl Compounds; Double-Blind Method; Electrocardiography; Female; Heart; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Receptors, Angiotensin; Tetrazoles","Lim, P O; Nys, M; Naas, A A; Struthers, A D; Osbakken, M; MacDonald, T M","Angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists have direct effects on the autonomic nervous system and myocardium. Because of this, we hypothesized that irbesartan would reduce QT dispersion to a greater degree than amlodipine, a highly selective vasodilator. To test this, we gathered electrocardiographic (ECG) data from a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind parallel group study that compared the antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan and amlodipine in elderly subjects with mild to moderate hypertension. Subjects were treated for 6 months with either drug. Hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol were added after 12 weeks if blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled. ECGs were obtained before randomization and at 6 months. A total of 188 subjects (118 with baseline ECGs) were randomized. We analyzed 104 subjects who had complete ECGs at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Baseline characteristics between treatments were similar, apart from a slight imbalance in diastolic BP (irbesartan [n=53] versus amlodipine [n=51], 99.2 [SD 3. 6] versus 100.8 [3.8] mm Hg; P=0.03). There were no significant differences in BP normalization (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg) between treatments at 6 months (irbesartan versus amlodipine, 80% versus 88%; P=0.378). We found a significant reduction in QT indexes in the irbesartan group (QTc dispersion mean, -11.4 [34.5] milliseconds, P=0.02; QTc max, -12.8 [35.5] milliseconds, P=0.01), and QTc dispersion did not correlate with the change in BP. The reduction in QT indexes with amlodipine (QTc dispersion, -9.7 [35.4] milliseconds, P=0.06; QTc max, -8.6 [33.2] milliseconds, P=0.07) did not quite reach statistical significance, but there was a correlation between the change in QT indexes and changes in systolic BP. In conclusion, irbesartan improved QT dispersion, and this effect may be important in preventing sudden cardiac death in at-risk hypertensive subjects.",5,E
10029786,Preterm labor.,"Female; Humans; Obstetric Labor, Premature; Pregnancy; Risk; Risk Factors; Tocolytic Agents; Ultrasonography, Prenatal","Weismiller, D G","Preterm labor is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in the United States. It is characterized by cervical effacement and/or dilatation and increased uterine irritability before 37 weeks of gestation. Women with a history of preterm labor are at greatest risk. Strategies for reducing the incidence of preterm labor and delivery have focused on educating both physicians and patients about the risks for preterm labor and methods of detecting preterm cervical dilatation. Methods used to predict preterm labor include weekly cervical assessment, transvaginal ultrasonography, detection of fetal fibronectin and home uterine activity monitoring. As yet, it is unclear if any of these strategies should be routinely employed. At present, management of preterm labor may include the use of tocolytic agents, corticosteroids and antibiotics.",4,E

The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a randomised intervention trial to compare the effects of ACE inhibition and conventional therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension.; CAPPP was a prospective, randomised, open trial with blinded endpoint evaluation. 10,985 patients were enrolled at 536 health centres in Sweden and Finland. Patients aged 25-66 years with a measured diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more on two occasions were randomly assigned captopril or conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blockers). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths.; Of 5492 patients assigned captopril and 5493 assigned conventional therapy, 14 and 13, respectively, were lost to follow-up. Primary endpoint events occurred in 363 patients in the captopril group (11.1 per 1000 patient-years) and 335 in the conventional-treatment group (10.2 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.05 [95% CI 0.90-1.22], p=0-52). Cardiovascular mortality was lower with captopril than with conventional treatment (76 vs 95 events; relative risk 0.77 [0.57-1-04], p=0.092), the rate of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction was similar (162 vs 161), but fatal and non-fatal stroke was more common with captopril (189 vs 148; 1.25 [1-01-1-55]. p=0.044).; Captopril and conventional treatment did not differ in efficacy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The difference in stroke risk is probably due to the lower levels of blood pressure obtained initially in previously treated patients randomised to conventional therapy.",6,E

Although there have been several studies examining this question, the results are conflicting, with previous estimates ranging from 20% to 83%. There have been only 2 studies examining the prevalence of overgrowth induced by diltiazem and amlodipine, with estimates of 74% and 3.3%, respectively.; The current study aimed to address the problems associated with these studies by examining a sample of patients taking one of 3 calcium channel blockers, who were drawn from a community-based population in northeastern England. Nine hundred eleven (911) subjects were recruited from general medical practices in the area. Of these, 442 were taking nifedipine, 181 amlodipine, and 186 diltiazem. In addition, 102 control subjects were examined. Drug and demographic data for each subject were recorded. The periodontal condition of all subjects was assessed including plaque index, papillary bleeding index, and a photograph of the anterior gingivae for subsequent analysis of overgrowth severity.; More than six percent (6.3%) of subjects taking nifedipine were seen to have significant overgrowth. This overgrowth was statistically greater than the amount of overgrowth seen in either of the other 2 drug groups or the control population. The prevalence of gingival overgrowth induced by amlodipine or diltiazem was not statistically significant when compared to the control group. The severity of overgrowth within the nifedipine group was found to be related to the amount of gingival inflammation and also to the gender of the subject, with males being 3 times as likely to develop overgrowth than females.; The prevalence of clinically significant overgrowth related to chronic medication with calcium channel blockers is low, i.e., 6.3% for nifedipine. Males are 3 times as likely as females to develop clinically significant overgrowth. The presence of gingival inflammation is an important cofactor for the expression of this effect.",I,2

Systolic Hypertension in Europe Trial Investigators.,"Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Calcium Channel Blockers; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Complications; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Nitrendipine; Proportional Hazards Models; Systole","Tuomilehto, J; Rastenyte, D; Birkenh盲ger, W H; Thijs, L; Antikainen, R; Bulpitt, C J; Fletcher, A E; Forette, F; Goldhaber, A; Palatini, P; Sarti, C; Fagard, R","Recent reports suggest that calcium-channel blockers may be harmful in patients with diabetes and hypertension. We previously reported that antihypertensive treatment with the calcium-channel blocker nitrendipine reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. In this post hoc analysis, we compared the outcome of treatment with nitrendipine in diabetic and nondiabetic patients.; After stratification according to center, sex, and presence or absence of previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients (age, > or =60 years) with systolic blood pressure of 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic pressure below 95 mm Hg were randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg per day) with the possible addition or substitution of enalapril (5 to 20 mg per day) or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg per day) or both, titrated to reduce the systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg and to less than 150 mm Hg. In the control group, matching placebo tablets were administered similarly.; At randomization, 492 patients (10.5 percent) had diabetes. After a median follow-up of two years, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the placebo and active-treatment groups differed by 8.6 and 3.9 mm Hg, respectively, among the diabetic patients. Among the 4203 patients without diabetes, systolic and diastolic pressures differed by 10.3 and 4.5 mm Hg, respectively, in the two groups. After adjustment for possible confounders, active treatment was found to have reduced overall mortality by 55 percent (from 45.1 deaths per 1000 patients to 26.4 deaths per 1000 patients), mortality from cardiovascular disease by 76 percent, all cardiovascular events combined by 69 percent, fatal and nonfatal strokes by 73 percent, and all cardiac events combined by 63 percent in the group of patients with diabetes. Among the nondiabetic patients, active treatment decreased all cardiovascular events combined by 26 percent and fatal and nonfatal strokes by 38 percent. In the group of patients receiving active treatment, reductions in overall mortality, mortality from cardiovascular disease, and all cardiovascular events were significantly larger among the diabetic patients than among the nondiabetic patients (P=0.04, P=0.02, and P=0.01, respectively).; Nitrendipine-based antihypertensive therapy is particularly beneficial in older patients with diabetes and isolated systolic hypertension. Thus, our findings do not support the hypothesis that the use of long-acting calcium-channel blockers may be harmful in diabetic patients.",6,6

Twenty-nine asymptomatic essential hypertensive patients (nine men, 20 women) with a mean age of 55.03+/-11.19 years and baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of > or =120 mm Hg after resting 30 min, not taking antihypertensive drugs for the last 24 h, were randomized in a single-blind fashion to receive lacidipine, 4 mg (LCD, 15 patients) or short-acting nifedipine, 20 mg (NFD, 14 patients) in a single dose. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were taken every 30 min during the first 8 h and every 2 h until 24 h of follow-up. Baseline BP values were similar in the two groups (LCD, 222.5+/-32.8/124.6+/-8.4 mm Hg vs. NFD, 215.9+/-20.6/128+/-7.7 mm Hg; p = NS). Both drugs promoted a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP; 169.6+/-27.8 vs. 170.6+/-25.3 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP; 104.1+/-16 vs. 102.9+/-12.4 mm Hg) after 8 h. However, either SBP (165+/-27.3 vs. 190.6+/-18.2 mm Hg; p = 0.008) and DBP (99.9+/-12.3 vs. 117.2+/-11.4 mm Hg; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the NFD group after 24-h dosing. Eleven patients in the LCD group had a decrease in BP >25% of the baseline value both 8 and 24 h after the dose. Although 10 patients showed the same response in the NFD group 8 h after the dose, only four patients maintained these values at 24 h. One patient treated with NFD had a transient cerebrovascular ischemic attack. No adverse effects were observed in the LCD group. We conclude that the long-acting calcium antagonist lacidipine was more effective than the short-acting nifedipine in both controlling BP and maintaining this BP reduction over 8 h in essential hypertensive patients with acute asymptomatic BP increase.",2,E

A total of 551 patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia and evidence of coronary artery disease were randomized to a 4-week, forced-dose titration treatment period with (1) COER-24 verapamil 240 mg titrated to 480 mg at bedtime (n = 173), (2) amlodipine 5 mg titrated to 10 mg/day (n = 149), (3) amlodipine 5 mg (titrated to 10 mg) plus atenolol 50 mg/day in the A.M.

Treadmill exercise tolerance testing (standard Bruce protocol), and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring were performed at the end of placebo lead-in and double-blind treatment. Each active treatment significantly improved symptom-limited exercise duration and time to moderate angina (p < or = 0.01 vs placebo). For patients with baseline ischemia, amlodipine resulted in a statistically significant increase in total duration of ischemic episodes compared with placebo, whereas COER-24 verapamil and amlodipine plus atenolol resulted in statistically significant decreases compared with placebo and amlodipine. Heart rate at onset of ischemic episodes and ST product were also significantly increased with amlodipine (p < 0.05) compared with either COER-24 or amlodipine plus atenolol. COER-24 and amlodipine alone or in combination with atenolol improved exercise capacity in patients with angina pectoris.

Treatment target was a sitting DBP < 95 mm Hg by the 9th week of treatment. This was followed by a 4-month open phase using nisoldipine CC 10 to 60 mg daily. Ninety-six patients had complete data at baseline, and at the end of the double-blind and open phases, and were included in this analysis. In both groups, all patients required titration up to the maximal dose of double-blind medication. Monotherapy with nisoldipine CC, but not enalapril, significantly reduced both sitting and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP). Twenty-four-hour BP in the nisoldipine CC group decreased from 179+/-14 / 118+/-7 to 144+/-16 / 94+/-10 mm Hg (P < .0001) versus 181+/-13 / 117+/-5 to 171+/-17 / 110+/-11 mm Hg in the enalapril group (P = ns). The profound decrease in blood pressure achieved with nisoldipine CC was accompanied by a significant reduction in left ventricular [LV] mass index, observed after only 2 months of treatment (from 146+/-40 to 129+/-35 g/m2, P = .05). In contrast, enalapril had no effect on LV mass (from 139+/-36 to 142+/-50 g/m2, P = NS). The antihypertensive effect of nisoldipine CC was further demonstrated in the open phase, during which 24-h BP decreased from 180+/-14 / 118+/-6 mm Hg (at baseline) to 142+/-16 / 92+/-10 mm Hg at the end of the 16-week open phase (P < .0001). This effect was sustained with trough-to-peak ratio of 74% for systolic and 67% for diastolic BP, with further regression in LV mass. Reduction in 24-h systolic BP to < 135 mm Hg was associated with a greater degree of regression of LV mass index in patients treated with nisoldipine CC. The incidence of adverse events in both groups was low and both nisoldipine CC and enalapril were well tolerated. The incidence of significant ventricular arrhythmia was also low and did not change with treatment. In conclusion, our findings suggest that nisoldipine CC administered once daily could be considered as a suitable first-line antihypertensive agent in black patients with severe hypertension, based on its profound and sustained blood-pressure-lowering effect, associated with significant regression of left ventricular mass and its low side effect profile.",2,E

Changes with calcium-blocker treatment in clinic and 24-h blood pressure (BP), heart rate, BP variability, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) by three methods (Valsalva manoeuvre, phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside injection), and in baroreflex- and non-baroreflex-mediated reflexes (tilt and cold face stimulus) were studied in 14 elderly subjects (mean age [+/- SEM] 70 +/- 1 years) with sustained isolated systolic hypertension (clinic BP 179 +/- 3/85 +/- 1 mm Hg). Clinic systolic BP, but not diastolic BP, was reduced with treatment (by 14 +/- 6 mm Hg, P = 0.03, diastolic BP 4 +/- 3 mm Hg, P = 0.16). Twenty-four hour BP was also reduced by nifedipine treatment (by 18 +/- 3/9 +/- 2 mm Hg, both P < 0.001). Clinic and 24-h heart rate, and daytime BP variability, were unchanged with treatment. BRS was significantly increased during nifedipine therapy by all three measurement methods (all P < 0.05). With 60 degrees tilt during active treatment, subjects exhibited a greater heart rate increase (P < 0.01), and a reduced fall in systolic (P < 0.05) and diastolic BP (P < 0.05). Thus despite the arteriosclerosis and reductions in large artery compliance described in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, clinically important improvements in clinic and ambulatory BP and some aspects of cardiovascular homeostasis can be achieved with calcium-channel blocking therapy.",5,E

After the completion of the Syst-Eur trial on 14 February 1997, 3506 consenting patients (93.0% of those eligible) were enrolled in phase 2 of the Syst-Eur trial. This open follow-up study aims to confirm the safety of long-term antihypertensive therapy based on a dihydropyridine. To lower the sitting systolic BP below 150 mm Hg (target BP), the first-line agent nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) may be associated with enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), both add-on study drugs, or if required any other antihypertensive agent. On 1 November 1998, 3248 patients were still being followed, 86 patients had proceeded to non-supervised follow-up, and 43 had died. The median follow-up in Syst-Eur 2 was 14.3 months. At the last available visit, systolic/diastolic BP in the patients formerly randomised to placebo (n = 1682) or active treatment (n = 1824), had decreased by 13.2/5.2 mm Hg and by 4.6/1.6 mm Hg, respectively, so that the between-group BP difference was 1.7 mm Hg systolic (95% Ci: 0.8 to 2.6 mm Hg; P < 0.001) and 0.9 mm Hg diastolic (95% Cl: 0.4 to 1.5 mm mm Hg; P < 0.001).

At baseline and after treatment, all patients underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, an evaluation of their metabolic profiles and a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp test. In a subgroup of 18 patients, a forearm study was carried out.; Blood pressure fell by the second week of treatment and remained significantly reduced compared with baseline in both treatment groups. Plasma triglyceride levels were also significantly reduced after trandolapril therapy, but no significant changes occurred in the other metabolic parameters during treatment with either drug. During the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp, whole-body glucose use was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline, and a moderate but statistically significant increase in insulin sensitivity was observed after trandolapril treatment (trandolapril: 5.0 +/- 0.2 versus 4.5 +/- 0.2 mg/kg per min; nifedipine: 4.1 +/- 0.3 versus 4.2 +/- 0.3 mg/kg per min; P < 0.05, versus baseline and trandolapril versus nifedipine treatment). Skeletal muscle glucose uptake was significantly higher after trandolapril than after nifedipine therapy (5.0 +/- 0.7 and 3.0 +/- 0.4 mg/min, respectively; P < 0.01). As forearm blood flow was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline and was unchanged after 8 weeks of therapy, skeletal muscle glucose extraction was significantly greater in the ACE inhibitor treated-group than in the nifedipine comparative group (trandolapril: baseline 21 +/- 2, treatment 24 +/- 3 mg/dl; nifedipine: baseline 18 +/- 3, treatment 16 +/- 2 mg/dl; P < 0.05, trandolapril versus nifedipine treatment).; During short-term treatment, ACE inhibition with trandolapril was able to moderately improve insulin sensitivity, in comparison with calcium blockade, and this effect appeared to be independent of the haemodynamic action of the drug.",5,E

LIS can occur during lasing itself or during subsequent adjunctive angioplasty. Intracoronary diltiazem (ICD) can partially reverse LIS after it occurs. To determine whether pre-treatment with ICD might prevent LIS during laser interventions, 3 groups of 50 lesions each were studied. Group 1 served as controls receiving no ICD during the procedure. Group 2 received 2.5 mg ICD before lasing. Group 3 received ICD before lasing and then a second infusion of 2.5 mg ICD after lasing but before adjunctive therapy. There were no differences in clinical characteristics of the 3 groups. Over 75% of lesions in each group were complex (B2 or C) lesions, and average lesion length was 15 mm in all 3 groups. Procedural success was > or = 94% in all groups. There was no significant difference among groups in pre-procedure artery stenosis, post-procedure stenosis, laser power used or number of laser pulses delivered. Pretreatment with ICD produced vasodilation of the minimum lumen diameter from 0.86 +/- 0.1 to 1.0 +/- 0.1 mm (p < 0.01) and was well tolerated. Control patients exhibited a 12% incidence of LIS. Group 2 had an 80% reduction of LIS during lasing (p < 0.01) but had increased LIS during adjunctive therapy with the same 12% incidence of LIS overall. Group 3 had only a 2% incidence of LIS (p < 0.01). We concluded that pretreatment with ICD significantly reduces LIS. Multiple infusions of ICD are necessary to sustain this protective effect.",6,E

Clinical pharmacists screened for ADRs at a county hospital in Indianapolis, IN. Patient information was reviewed on admission, every four days during hospitalization, and at discharge. ADRs occurring after hospital admission were assessed for causality, severity, pharmacological type (i.e., augmented pharmacology versus idiosyncratic reaction) and affected organ system. Nurse and pharmacist reports, incident reports, physician consults, patient transfers to critical care units, and serum drug concentration reports were additional means of ADR identification. Overall, 23.1% of patients experienced an ADR while 2.6% of the 11,702 drug exposures resulted in an ADR. Patients aged greater than 65 years (29.6% vs. 20.5% for younger patients) and females (26.2% vs. 20% for males) were at higher risk for ADR development (p < 0.05). Length of hospital stay was longer (13.3 days vs. 6.7 days; p < 0.05) and drug exposures more frequent for patients experiencing ADRs (p < 0.001).

Whether this relates mainly to specific drug side effects or to primary pathogenic disorders is unknown. In the present study 101 male patients from our outpatient hypertension clinic answered detailed questionnaires about hypertension and sexual function. Patients with perceived impotence were offered a thorough penile evaluation and examination performed by specialists in the urology department. Twenty-seven (27%) men had impotence. The main cause of impotence was an arterial dysfunction (89%). The prevalence of impotence was related to the degree of secondary organ manifestation, reflected by World Health Organization (WHO) classification I-III (P = .01). Intermittent claudication (P = .001) and ischemic heart disease (P = .005) were the best determinants in this respect. Twelve impotent patients (44%) ascribed onset of impotence to drug initiation. A variety of drugs were incriminated in the occurrence of drug-induced impotence. In summary our results indicate that impotence in hypertensive men is caused mainly by penile arterial vascular changes, probably atherosclerosis. Drug-induced impotence could well be the result of blood pressure reduction itself and not specific drug side effects.",6,E

A battery of questions evaluating psychological well-being and a physical symptom distress index was administered after a 4-week placebo washout (baseline) and after 10 weeks of treatment or at dropout.; Both treatments effectively lowered blood pressure, and there were no significant between-group differences in psychosocial QOL. A difference in the level of physical symptom distress was detected between treatments (P = .002; multivariate analysis of variance), with 7 significant univariate treatment effects, all favoring COER-verapamil, being noted-pedal edema, polyuria, rapid heart beat or palpitations, hives, muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, and headaches. Constipation-related distress increased significantly (P = .001) but to a similar extent with both treatments. The difference in symptom distress tended to predict compliance as there were more withdrawals in the nifedipine GITS group (n = 85) vs COER-verapamil group (n = 64) (P = .08).; Patient-assessed physical symptom distress is a sensitive, simple technique to evaluate the effect of antihypertensive medications on QOL and tolerability, as shown by its ability to detect the improvement associated with COER-verapamil. Depending on the agents involved, the Physical Symptom Distress Index may more closely predict dropout rates than the traditional psychosocial instruments, as suggested by the lower dropout rate in the COER-verapamil group. Thus, in studying treatment effects on QOL, both the distress of physical symptoms and the impact of psychosocial factors should be evaluated.",I,I

(Logimax) or captopril-hydrochlorothiazide, 25/25 mg o.d. (Capozide). After a further 4 weeks, there was a mandatory dose increase to felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg o.d., and captopril-hydrochlorothiazide, 50/25 mg o.d., and treatment then continued for a another 4 weeks. At the end of the study, felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide. The mean differences in change in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure between treatments after 8 weeks were 5.2 and 3.4 mm Hg, respectively, in favour of felodipine-metoprolol (p<0.05). Standing blood pressure also showed trends in favour of felodipine-metoprolol. The proportion of responders was similar in both groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. Two patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and 5 with captopril-hydrochlorothiazide discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Felodipine-metoprolol combination reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide with maintained tolerability.",2,E

Some have argued that long-acting calcium channel blockers are safer, but few outcome data exist. The objective of the study was to compare the occurrence of adverse outcomes among recipients of long-acting versus short-acting calcium channel blockers, with dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridines compared separately.; The New Jersey Medicare population.; A retrospective cohort study using linked Medicare and drug claims data.; Older survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI) occurring in 1989 and 1990. Eligible subjects had survived at least 30 days after the MI, participated in Medicare and a drug benefits program, and were prescribed a single type of either a long-acting or a short-acting calcium channel blocker within 90 days after the MI.; The two outcome measures were rates of all-cause mortality and cardiac rehospitalization. Using separate Cox regression models for dihydropyridines (nifedipine, nicardipine) and non-dihydropyridines (diltiazem, verapamil), we examined these outcomes for recipients of long-acting compared with short-acting calcium channel blockers.; Of the 833 patients eligible for the study, 160 were prescribed long-acting and 673 short-acting calcium channel blockers. Clinical characteristics of long-acting and short-acting users were comparable. During 2 years of follow-up, 221 deaths and 300 rehospitalizations occurred. Controlling for age, sex, race, and indicators of disease severity and comorbidity, the relative risk of dying for recipients of long-acting, compared with short-acting, dihydropyridines was .42 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21-0.86). For cardiac rehospitalization, the relative risk was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.34-0.94). For the long-acting versus short-acting nondihydropyridines, the adjusted relative risk of dying was 1.43 (95% CI, 0.88-2.32), and for cardiac rehospitalization, .65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.05).; Use of long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers after acute MI was associated with substantially lower rates of cardiac rehospitalization and death compared with use of their short-acting counterparts. More data are needed to address the possibility that long-acting, compared with short-acting, non-dihydropyridines could decrease rehospitalization rates but increase mortality.",I,I

The presence of acute or ongoing end-organ damage constitutes a hypertensive emergency, which requires reduction of blood pressure within minutes to hours to avoid catastrophic outcomes. Critically elevated blood pressure without end-organ damage is known as a hypertensive urgency, which is generally treated over 24 to 48 hours in a closely monitored outpatient setting. Although hypertensive crises are relatively rare, most primary care physicians will eventually encounter them. Thus, for optimal patient outcomes, it is important to be aware of appropriate treatment options as well as the impact of potential complications on management.",5,E

Exercise testing (ETT) was performed by bicycle ergometry.; Although none of the calcium channel blockers improved duration of exercise or amount of workload, all significantly delayed onset of 1 mm ST-segment depression on ETT (P<0.001 for any treatment vs baseline). In addition, mibefradil, both low and high dose treatment, produced the longest delays (low dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 24.1 and 29.8 s, respectively, P<0. 003 and <0.001; high dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 33.7 and 37.0 s, respectively, P<0.001 and <0.001). These effects were linearly correlated with the reduction in rate pressure product (RPP). Serious symptoms of dizziness occurred significantly more frequently on mibefradil (P<0.05), and 19 patients on mibefradil withdrew from trial.; Calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic properties provide greater delay of ischaemia in patients with exercise-induced angina, but the concomitant risk of intolerable dizziness attenuates this benefit.",I,6

To determine the frequency of spontaneous recognition of these ADRs by the attending physicians and to assess the potential value of ALS for detection of ADRs.; Laboratory results of patients hospitalised in a nine bed medical ward were automatically recorded over a period of 17 months. Values exceeding defined boundaries were used as ALS. Charts of every third patient were analysed retrospectively with regard to adverse drug related reactions and causality was evaluated as well as whether the ADR had been recognised during the period of hospitalisation.; The charts and ALS of 98 patients were analysed. In 18 cases a drug-related adverse reaction was probable. Awareness to the reaction by the treating physicians was evident in 6 out of these 18 ADRs. Approximately 80% of the ADRs were considered predictable. Three ADRs were regarded as serious.; Adverse drug reactions are common and often preventable. Only one third of ADRs which could have been detected through ALS were recognised by the attending physicians. An increased doctor's awareness of the frequency of drug related abnormal laboratory results by means of ALS is likely to increase the recognition rate of ADRs and might help to prevent them.,6,E

In angina, nifedipine can be used only in combination with a betablocker, and only to treat patients with no recent history of myocardial infarction, or unstable angina. In stable angina with inadequate symptom control by betablockers, it is no more effective than other dihydropyridines also indicated in the treatment of angina, i.e. amlodipine and felodipine.

The mechanisms underlying this disorder are complex and include altered vascular endothelial function. Vasodilators such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide are suppressed, whereas vasoconstrictors, including endothelin, are increased. Changes in the kidney include vasoconstriction, reduced glomerular filtration and sodium retention.

Ninety (63%) of 143 identified studies met the inclusion criteria.; Two independent reviewers extracted data from selected articles, settling any differences by consensus. Outcome data were extracted a third time by 1 of the investigators. We combined results using odds ratios (ORs) for discrete data and mean differences for continuous data.

Successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events. However, several antiarrhythmic drugs are also known to increase the risk of proarrhythmic events. A randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled multicenter trial with 1000 patients to be recruited was designed to compare the effects of two antiarrhythmic drugs frequently used in Germany for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, Sotalol and the fixed combination of chinidin and verapamil (Cordichin). Patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter will be observed for a period of one year. The occurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is documented by transtelephonic ECG monitoring. Patients with document an ECG once daily, and recording is mandatory in case of symptoms. ECGs are transmitted to a central data base for analysis. This clinical trial is designed to answer the following questions: (1) What is the average rate of spontaneous events of symptomatic atrial fibrillation? (2) Is it possible to reduce the frequency of symptomatic events by chronic antiarrhythmic drug administration? (3) What is the long-term frequency for the occurrence of severe side-effects under antiarrhythmic medication? The primary endpoint is defined as the time to first recurrence of symptomatic arrhythmia after reaching steady-state plasma concentrations of the study medication.

However, despite manifold publications reflecting numerous clinical trials about treatment of AF, the management of this arrhythmia is still under controversial discussion, in daily clinical work as well as in research. The present study concentrates on three major questions: 1. How frequent are recurrences of AF in long-term follow-up? Most of the previous studies used the occurrence of symptoms as a surrogate parameter for recurrences of AF, despite the expected high rate of asymptomatic relapses. In the present study a daily transtelephonic ECG transmission enables a rhythm monitoring independent of symptoms. 2. Is the frequency of AF recurrences significantly reduced by antiarrhythmic medication? A direct comparison of class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs, which still are most frequently used for this indication, and of placebo will answer this question. 3. How safe is the long-term treatment for the prevention of AF recurrences with special respect to proarrhythmic effects? The daily transtelephonic ECG transmission enables a quantitative and qualitative monitoring of tachy- and bradyarrhythmias independent of symptoms. Additionally, the daily analysis of ECG measures may detect parameters predicting subsequent life threatening arrhythmias. The study design provides a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter parallel group comparison. In Germany and in the Czech Republic about 90 hospitals will include 900 patients with documented chronic AF, age 18 to 80 years, if they are eligible for electrical cardioversion without concomitant antiarrhythmic drug therapy and if they are anticoagulated for at least three weeks prior to inclusion. Neither the size of the left atrium nor the duration of chronic AF are exclusion criteria. A few hours after successful electrical cardioversion the patients are randomised either to sotalol (2 x 160 mg) or quinidine + verapamil (3 x 160 mg + 3 x 80 mg) or placebo. Starting at the day after cardioversion, the patient is asked to record and transmit electrocardiograms of one minute duration at least once a day using his personal transtelephonic ECG recording unit (Tele-ECG recorder, credit card size), in case of symptoms as often as necessary. The ECGs can be transmitted at any time by any regular phone without additional equipment using a toll free number. A custom made, computer based, fully automated receiving centre is handling the patient calls interactively with voice control, including a voice recording of the patient's symptoms. The ECG tracings and the patient's voice messages are subsequently computer based analysed by experienced technicians. All ECG measures are stored in a database. In case of AF recurrence, any other relevant arrhythmia or additional abnormalities (e.g. QT prolongation) the correspondent hospital is immediately informed by fax. In case of AF recurrence, a subsequent Holter recording discriminates in paroxysmal and permanent AF. Study medication is ended if either permanent AF or the third episode of paroxysmal AF are detected or after 12 months of follow-up. Regular follow-up visits are performed monthly. Major endpoints are the time to first recurrence of AF or the time to death, secondary parameters are the number of AF recurrences, the time to end of medication and AF related symptoms. The recruitment started in the last days of 1996. Until the end of June 1998, 424 patients have been randomised. It is expected to end recruitment in spring 1999 and to close the study in spring 2000. Final results will be available in summer 2000.",2,E

The group randomized to the combination had significantly greater reductions in sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP)--14.2/10.6 mm Hg compared with baseline versus 9.6/7.4 mm Hg (P < .05/.01)--as well as a greater percentage of patients having achieved either diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg or a decline of at least 10 mm Hg (responders), 59% v 41% (P < .01). When patients originally taking 10 mg enalapril were crossed over to the combination therapy for a further 6 weeks, there was a further BP reduction and increase in response rate, with loss of significant differences compared with those treated continuously with the combination for the entire 12 weeks. The greater BP-lowering efficacy of the combination was independent of age, gender, and race. There were no significant differences in tolerability between the regimens. These data support the hypothesis that in patients who do not achieve goal BP reduction with a low dose of an antihypertensive agent, a combination of two drugs with complementary mechanisms of action is more effective than increasing the dose of the first agent.",5,E

This randomized, double-blind study was performed to assess the residual antihypertensive effect of amlodipine 5 mg O.D. 3 days after discontinuing therapy in previously well-controlled mild to moderate hypertensive patients. Blood pressure (BP) was evaluated by conventional (OBP) and by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Amlodipine 5 mg OD administered during a 6-week period, significantly reduced both OBP and ABPM mean values (p < 0.05), whereas no change in heart rate was observed. At the end of the active treatment period, adequately controlled patients were randomized either to amlodipine 5 mg OD (group A) or amlodipine for 12 days followed by a 3-day period on placebo. After this double-blind treatment phase, group P exhibited no significant increase in BP (assessed by OBP or ABPM) when compared to group A. In conclusion, the duration of action of amlodipine extends largely beyond the 24-h span, and when patients omit their treatment for 3 days BP does not significantly increase.",5,E

Extended-release felodipine (felodipine ER) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of ISH in Caucasians. However, its pharmacological properties are different from another calcium blocker, diltiazem. Also, the effectiveness, tolerability, and adverse reactions of these two antihypertensive agents for ISH have not been thoroughly assessed in Chinese.; Sitting blood pressures (BP), heart rate, body weight, adverse reactions, and serum biochemistry were assessed in 70 patients with isolated systolic hypertension (34 treated with felodipine ER and 36 slow-release diltiazem [diltiazem SR] for 10 weeks). Each patient was given 5 mg of felodipine ER or 90 mg of diltiazem SR once daily and was doubled to twice daily if necessary.; Five patients on felodipine ER and four on diltiazem SR withdrew because of intolerable side effects. By ten weeks, 67.6% of the patients responded to a daily dose of 5-10 mg of felodipine ER and 58.3% to a daily dose of 90-180 mg of diltiazem SR. At the end of treatment, felodipine ER lowered the mean BP from 187/83 mmHg at baseline to 149/74 mmHg, whereas diltiazem SR decreased the BP from 185/84 mmHg to 158/78 mmHg (not significant between the two groups). The heart rate did not change significantly in either group. Overall, these two groups of patients had the same rate of adverse reactions (50.0% vs. 50.0%) with similar profiles of the adverse effects.; Equivalent doses of felodipine ER and diltiazem SR are effective first-line monotherapeutic agents for the treatment of ISH.",5,E

After reviewing the literature we conclude the following. beta-Agonists have been shown to prolong gestation for 24 to 48 hours; however, these agents have not been shown to decrease neonatal morbidity or mortality. Adverse effects are inevitable and can be life-threatening. There are no proven benefits to mother or fetus with long term therapy. More data are needed regarding the tolerability and efficacy of calcium antagonists before routine clinical use can be recommended. Oxytocin antagonists should be considered investigational drugs and further studies are needed to evaluate their effectiveness in the treatment of preterm labour. Furthermore, the tolerability of oxytocin antagonists in both mother and fetus has not been adequately established. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, has been shown to delay delivery in a limited number of randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials. Sulindac appears promising but has never been evaluated in a well controlled trial. Neonatal adverse effects appear to be minimal with prostaglandin inhibitors as long as the duration of treatment is short (<48 to 72 hours) and the gestational age is <32 weeks. Magnesium sulfate appears to inhibit myometrial contractility but is ineffective at prolonging gestation or preventing preterm birth. Furthermore, magnesium has not been shown to decrease neonatal morbidity or mortality; in fact, some investigators have shown an increase in infant mortality with this agent. There are no data to support adjunctive antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of preterm labour. Oral maintenance therapy with any of these tocolytic agents has not been shown to decrease the rate of preterm birth or recurrent preterm labour.",4,E

Losartan potassium, a selective antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, has been shown to lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of losartan and extended-release (ER) felodipine in Taiwanese patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure, 95-115 mm Hg) were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, parallel study. Sitting blood pressure, heart rate, adverse reactions, and serum biochemistry values were assessed during 2 weeks of placebo and 12 weeks of active treatment. Each patient received 50 mg of losartan or 5 mg of felodipine ER once daily, and the dosage was adjusted to double the initial level at week 6 if necessary. Of the 44 patients randomly allocated to receive losartan (n = 23) or felodipine (n = 21) therapy, 37 completed the study; three patients in the losartan group and four in the felodipine group withdrew because of adverse experiences, or were lost to follow-up. The mean reductions in sitting diastolic blood pressure at 6 and 12 weeks were significant with both losartan (-8.6 and -11.38 mm Hg, respectively) and felodipine (-9.2 and -10.69 mm Hg, respectively), and did not differ significantly between the two groups. Both losartan and ER felodipine were well tolerated by patients. However, the ER felodipine group had a significantly higher rate of drug-related flushing than the losartan group (24% vs 0%, p = 0.022). The results indicate that once-daily administration of losartan is as effective and well tolerated as once-daily ER felodipine in blood pressure reduction.",5,E

Relatively few head-to-head comparative studies between fixed-dose combinations and first-line monotherapies for hypertension have been published. The objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of various first-line monotherapies and the fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril. The results of the meta-analysis were used to compare the efficacy and safety of the first-line monotherapies with amlodipine/benazepril. The meta-analysis included 82 studies that included 110 treatment groups (cohorts). The study compared nine different monotherapies and one combination therapy (amlodipine/benazepril). Of the 82 studies, 22 were placebo-controlled and 60 were active treatment controlled. The mean absolute decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) ranged from 9.7 to 13.3 mm Hg with verapamil showing the greatest effect and captopril the least (13.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg; 9.7 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, respectively). When studies were weighted by sample size, atenolol, verapamil, lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest BP effect. When studies were weighted by variance, amlodipine/benazepril and atenolol showed the greatest BP effect. The percentage of patients controlled on therapy ranged from 54% to 79%. Lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest percent controlled. The overall incidence of adverse effects ranged from 12.1% to 41.8% with lisinopril having the lowest and nifedipine having the highest incidence. The overall incidence of adverse effects resulting in drug discontinuance ranged from 1.3% to 10.7%, with amlodipine/benazepril having the lowest and nifedipine having the highest incidence. The results of the meta-analysis indicate that amlodipine/benazepril produces above average reductions in BP with a lower than average incidence of overall side effects and the lowest incidence of adverse effects resulting in drug discontinuance. The fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril achieves its goal of effective BP lowering with a minimum of significant side effects.",2,E

Twenty-one patients (mean age 13.1 years) with either essential (n=160) or renal (n=5) hypertension, and newly diagnosed (n=15) or poorly controlled or intolerant on existing antihypertensive therapy (n=6), were included. Patients received amlodipine once daily at a starting mean dose of 0.07+/-0.04 mg/kg per day. The total daily dose of amlodipine was increased 25%-50% every 5-7 days if the mean home blood pressure measurements (HBPM) were above the 95th percentile for age and gender. A baseline followed by a repeat 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitor study (ABPM) was performed in 20 patients when the mean HBPM was below the 95th percentile goal. The mean titrated dose required to control BP was 0.29+/-0.11 mg/kg per day for those < 13 years, 0.16+/-0.11 mg/kg per day for those > or = 13 years, 0.23+/-0.14 mg/kg per day for essential, hypertension and 0.24+/-0.13 mg/kg per day for renal hypertension. The ABPM demonstrated that amlodipine provided effective BP control as primary therapy in 14 essential patients. Adverse effects included fatigue (n=6), headache (n=5), facial flushing (n=4), dizziness (n=3), edema (n=3), abdominal pain (n=3), chest pain (n=2), nausea (n=1), and vomiting (n=1). Quality of life appeared to improve during therapy. Amlodipine was an effective once daily antihypertensive agent with an acceptable safety profile.

In comparison to placebo, nifedipine significantly decreased 24-h mean BP in all groups either with HS or LS diets (all p<0.05). With HS, greater hypotensive effects were achieved in NT-SS (-10+/-2 mm Hg) versus NT-SR (-3+/-1 mm Hg; p<0.05) and in HT-SS (-18+/-2 mm Hg) versus HT-SR (-12+/-2 mm Hg; p<0.05). In NT-SS and HT-SS, nifedipine induced greater (p<0.05) BP decrease with HS (-10+/-2 and -18+/-2 mm Hg) than with LS (-4+/-1 and -9+/-1 mm Hg, respectively), whereas in NT-SR and HT-SR, the hypotensive effect did not differ between HS and LS. Nifedipine versus placebo significantly increased natriuresis and fractional excretion of sodium in all groups only with HS (p<0.05) but not with LS diets. Only in HT-SS were the hypotensive and natriuretic effects of nifedipine significantly correlated (r = -0.77; p<0.01). Nifedipine produced a similar increase of the urinary excretion of dopamine, L-DOPA, and of DOPAC in all subjects, which did not correlate with hypotensive and natriuretic effects. Nifedipine did not modify plasma levels of renin and of aldosterone except in NT-SS with HS, in whom nifedipine increased PRA levels (p <0.05). We conclude that although nifedipine reduces BP in all groups of NT and HT with LS and HS diets, the effect is greater in salt-sensitive subjects with HS. Although in HT-SS with HS, the short-term natriuretic response to nifedipine may contribute to its hypotensive effects, the diuretic-natriuretic effect of nifedipine is not necessary for the expression of its hypotensive effect. Moreover, it is unlikely that any short-term effects of nifedipine either on the renal dopaminergic system or on the secretion of aldosterone explain nifedipine short-term hypotensive and diuretic-natriuretic effects.",5,E

The reason lies in the type of exercise as well as in methodological problems. A powerful, recently introduced procedure to detect platelet activation is flow cytometry. Platelet response to activating factors is mediated by calcium uptake; however, calcium antagonist effect on platelet activity is still unclear.; The study was undertaken to investigate exercise-induced platelet activation before and after treatment with amlodipine in chronic stable angina.; Twenty patients with chronic stable angina were entered into the study. Each subject underwent a symptom-limited cycloergometer stress test following a washout period of 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after exercise. All subjects were then randomized into two groups of 10 patients each, with Group 1 and Group 2 taking amlodipine 10 mg/day, and placebo for 4 weeks, respectively. They subsequently underwent a second exercise stress test, and blood samples were obtained before and immediately after exercise. Flow-cytometric evaluation of platelet activity was performed in order to recognize GMP-140 expression on platelet membrane.; Strenuous exercise induced a significant increase in platelet activation in all subjects prior to therapy. No significant differences were observed in platelet activity at rest between Groups 1 and 2, whereas a significant decrease in exercise-induced platelet activation was demonstrated in Group 1 compared with Group 2.; Our data provide evidence of the favorable effect of amlodipine on exercise-induced platelet activation in patients affected by chronic stable angina.",5,E

The studies were scored for blinding, method of randomization and type of analysis ('intention-to-treat' versus 'par protocol'). Subsequently, two by two tables were constructed using 'delay of labor by 48 hours or more', 'delay of labor beyond 36 weeks gestation', perinatal mortality, respiratory distress syndrome and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit as end points. Homogeneity between the studies was tested with a Breslow-Day test. Pooled odds ratios were calculated in case homogeneity could not be rejected.; We could detect ten studies that were published between 1986 and 1998, incorporating data of 681 patients.

This study investigated the anatomic characteristics and electrophysiological properties of pulmonary veins (PVs), as well as the possible mechanisms and response to drugs of ectopic foci, and assessed the effects of radiofrequency (RF) ablation on AF initiated by ectopic beats originating from PVs.; Seventy-nine patients with frequent episodes of paroxysmal AF and 10 control patients were included. Distal PVs showed the shortest effective refractory periods (ERPs), and right superior PVs showed a higher incidence of intra-PV conduction block than left superior PVs. Superior and left PVs had longer myocardial sleeves than inferior and right PVs, respectively. These electrophysiological characteristics were similar between AF and control patients. Propranolol, verapamil, and procainamide suppressed ectopic beats that originated from the PVs. Of 116 ectopic foci that initiated AF, 103 (88.8%) originated from PVs. A mean of 7+/-3 RF applications completely eliminated 110 ectopic foci (94.8%). During the 6+/-2-month follow-up period, 68 patients (86. 1%) were free of AF without any antiarrhythmic drugs. Follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram showed 42.4% of ablated PVs had focal stenosis. One patient had mild exertional dyspnea after ablation, but it resolved 3 months later; 1 patient had onset of mild exertional dyspnea 5 months after ablation.; Electrophysiological characteristics of PVs are different from those in the atria. Ectopic beats from PVs can initiate AF, and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, calcium channel blockers, and sodium channel blockers can suppress these ectopic beats. Careful mapping and elimination of these ectopic foci can cure paroxysmal AF.",I,6

The recently published Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) uses evidence-based medicine in providing guidelines to aid clinicians in the prevention, detection and treatment of high blood pressure, including pharmacological approaches. Calcium antagonists are used widely for the treatment of hypertension, and JNC-VI focuses on specific situations where calcium antagonists could be considered as preferred treatments. There are a large number of calcium antagonists available, with a variety of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic actions. Several sustained-release formulations of these drugs are also available. In terms of blood pressure control, calcium antagonists are more effective as antihypertensive treatments than beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in Black patients. The dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. The rate-lowering calcium antagonists can be used as alternatives to beta-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. Calcium antagonists can be used as alternatives to ACE inhibitors in patients with hypertension and concomitant diabetes mellitus and/or renal disease. Some dihydropyridine calcium antagonists may be useful as alternatives to ACE inhibitors in patients with hypertension and systolic heart failure. Calcium antagonists appear to be extremely useful in patients with cyclosporin-induced hypertension, and in patients with hypertension and concomitant Raynaud's phenomenon and/or migraine. The rate-lowering agents can be used in patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias and hypertension. Clinicians should be aware of drug-drug interactions involving calcium antagonists, especially after the recent problems with mibefradil. Although retrospective studies have caused controversy regarding the safety of calcium antagonists in patients with hypertension, recent prospective studies have revealed no major safety concerns with these drugs.",5,E

To achieve effective 24-h blood pressure control with once-daily dosing, it relies on various extended drug-delivery systems that have grown in importance as a result of the recent reports relating the use of short-acting calcium channel antagonists to increased cardiovascular morbidity. This study examines the pharmacokinetics and resulting pharmacodynamics of two different delivery systems, each loaded with 240 mg of diltiazem and administered to 40 moderately hypertensive patients in a randomized, double-blind crossover trial. After a 4-week, single-blind placebo lead-in, patients with a clinical diastolic blood pressure of > or =100 mm Hg were randomized to either the single or dual microbead diltiazem delivery system for a 4-week period. At the end of this period, each subject was evaluated with 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and subjected to 24-h inpatient pharmacokinetic analysis on separate days. This was followed by a similar 4-week period in which each subject was treated with the alternative delivery system. For diltiazem, the area under the curve for plasma concentration versus time and the maximum plasma concentration attained by the single microbead system exceeded the values achieved by the dual bead system by 15% and 25%, respectively. These differences were greatest from the 3rd through the 13th h after dosing. During this period, both systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure was significantly lower when the single microbead system was used. When compared with baseline blood pressure, blood pressure reductions achieved with the single microbead system exceeded reductions achieved with the dual microbead system by at least 2 mm Hg for 10 of the 24 postdose hours. Heart rates were slightly reduced but not significantly different. This improved blood pressure control at higher plasma levels of diltiazem suggests that a more efficient delivery system could provide better blood pressure control for identical doses of diltiazem.",5,E

Ambulatory electrocardiograms were analyzed for ventricular premature complexes and ST-segment depression. During a median follow-up of 40 months, 29 patients died of cardiovascular (CV) causes, 27 had a nonfatal myocardial infarction, and 89 underwent revascularization. Patients with CV death had more episodes (median 5 vs. 1; p<0.01) and longer median duration (24 vs. 3 minutes; p<0.01) of ST-segment depression than patients without events. For those who had undergone revascularization, the duration was also longer (12 vs. 3 minutes; p<0.05). In a multivariate Cox model including sex, history of previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, and diabetes, the duration of ST-segment depression independently predicted CV death. When exercise testing was included, ambulatory ischemia carried additional prognostic information only among patients with ST-segment depression > or =2 mm during exercise. When the treatment given and treatment effects on ambulatory ischemia were added to the Cox model, no significant impact on prognosis was found. Ventricular premature complexes carried no prognostic information. Thus, in patients with stable angina pectoris, ischemia during ambulatory monitoring showed independent prognostic importance regarding CV death. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise testing provide complementary information, but only among patients with marked ischemia during exercise. Treatment reduced ambulatory ischemia, but the short-term treatment effects did not significantly influence prognosis.",I,E

Fifty-one patients were followed for 6 weeks. Results of 24 hour blood pressure monitoring at visits after 2, 4 and 6 weeks were only known to physicians of group A. In this group the patients took their blood pressure twice per day.; Both methods for measurement showed an overall decrease of blood pressure in the course of therapy. The mean values at the medical visits were always higher than the average measurements by 24 hour monitoring or the self assessment of blood pressure. The latter two blood pressure values tended to agree favorably. The differences between measurements during medical visits and measurements taken at home or during normal activity show that measurements in the doctor's office may lead to overestimation of hypertension. Without the results from blood pressure monitoring 4 (22%) of the patients in group B were treated without reason. Nifedipine GITS was well tolerated. Nine patients (16%) had undesired drug effects leading to a premature halt of treatment in 3 of them.",6,E

Adjunctive vasodilation through calcium channel blockade has been suggested as potentially useful. However, the first-generation calcium channel blockers, including the dihydropyridine nifedipine, showed disappointing results in CHF. The second-generation dihydropyridines were expected to be of more value, and of all the calcium channel blockers, these drugs were the ones most studied in patients with CHF.; The Medline databank was used to search studies in human beings (published in 1990 or later) that used dihydropyridines in patients with CHF. The references of the studies found were subsequently checked for additional data. In 17 studies and more than 2000 patients with CHF, no consistent beneficial effect was observed with regard to exercise tolerance and functional capacity, whereas plasma neurohormones were not affected. On the other hand, in general, no worsening of CHF was seen with these second-generation dihydropyridines. Two larger studies (PRAISE and V-HeFT III) have given some estimates on the long-term effects of dihydropyridines, and no overall influence on mortality rate was found. Of note, subanalysis of the PRAISE study has suggested that in patients with a nonischemic cause of CHF, amlodipine might have a beneficial effect on survival.; In this review we have focused on the efficacy and safety of dihydropyridines in patients with CHF, as reported in recent trials. The data do not support the use of dihydropyridines when primarily given as treatment for CHF. The results, however, suggest that these drugs can be safely given to patients with left ventricular dysfunction or CHF who need additional treatment for angina pectoris or hypertension.",5,E

However, the long-term renal effects of ACE inhibitors in these patients remain inconclusive. In 1989, we commenced a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to examine the anti-albuminuric effects of enalapril versus nifedipine (slow release) in 102 hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients. These patients have been followed up for a mean trial duration of 5.5 +/- 2.2 years. We examined the determinants, including the effect of ACE inhibition on clinical outcomes in these patients.; After a six-week placebo-controlled, run-in period, 52 patients were randomized double-blind to receive nifedipine (slow release) and 50 patients to receive enalapril. After the one-year analysis, which confirmed the superior anti-albuminuric effects of enalapril (-54%) over nifedipine (+11%), all patients were continued on their previously assigned treatment with informed consent. They were subdivided into normoalbuminuric (N = 43), microalbuminuric (N = 34), and macroalbuminuric (N = 25) groups based on two of three 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE) measurements during the run-in period. Renal function was shown by the 24-hour UAE, creatinine clearance (CCr), and the regression coefficient of the yearly plasma creatinine reciprocal (beta-1/Cr). Clinical endpoints were defined as death, cardiovascular events, and/or renal events (need for renal replacement therapy or doubling of baseline plasma creatinine).; In the whole group, patients treated with enalapril were more likely to revert to being normoalbuminuric (23.8 vs. 15.4%), and fewer of them developed macroalbuminuria (19.1 vs. 30.8%) compared with the nifedipine-treated patients (P < 0.05). In the microalbuminuric group, treatment with enalapril (N = 21) was associated with a 13.0% (P < 0.01) reduction in 24-hour UAE compared with a 17.3% increase in the nifedipine group (N = 13). In the macroalbuminuric patients, enalapril treatment (N = 11) was associated with stabilization compared with a decline in renal function in the nifedipine group, as shown by the beta-1/Cr (0.65 +/- 4.29 vs. -1.93 +/- 2.35 1/micromol x 10-3, P < 0.05) after adjustment for baseline values. Compared with the normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients, those with macroalbuminuria had the lowest mean CCr (75.5 +/- 24.1 vs. 63.5 +/- 21.3 vs. 41.9 +/- 18.5 mL/min, P < 0.001) and the highest frequency of clinical events (4.7 vs. 5.9 vs. 52%, P < 0. 001). On multivariate analysis, beta-1/Cr (R2 = 0.195, P < 0.001) was independently associated with baseline HbA1c (beta = -0.285, P = 0.004), whereas clinical outcomes (R2 = 0.176, P < 0.001) were independently related to the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = 2.426, P = 0.018), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = -8.797, P = 0.03), baseline UAE (beta = 0.002, P = 0.04), and mean CCr during treatment (beta = -0.211, P = 0.006).; In this prospective cohort analysis involving 102 hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients with varying degrees of albuminuria followed up for a mean duration of five years, we observed the importance of good metabolic and blood pressure control on the progression of albuminuria and renal function. Treatment with enalapril was associated with a greater reduction in albuminuria than with nifedipine in the entire patient group, and especially in those with microalbuminuria. In the macroalbuminuric patients, the rate of deterioration in renal function was also attenuated by treatment with enalapril.",I,I

The assessment of LLT use during the 3-year trial was evaluated in patients receiving amlodipine therapy and placebo; levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were used to assess the impact of LLT.; Despite a baseline prevalence of LLT in 42% of men (38% in 1994), half of the patients had high levels of LDL-C (>3.36 mmol [>130 mg/dL]). During the subsequent 3 years, the prevalence of elevated LDL-C levels dropped in men (29%) but remained stagnant in women (48%). These changes were associated with increased LLT in men (55%) but not in women (35%) (P = .04). In 1994, the LDL-C target goal (<2.59 mmol/L [<100 mg/dL]) was attained in 17% of men and 6% of women (P = .006). At study completion in 1997, the LDL-C target goal was achieved in 31% of men and only 12% of women (P = .001).; This study highlights the relatively low treatment rates of hyperlipidemia among patients with CAD overall and women in particular who were participating in a clinical trial at academic medical centers in the United States and Canada.

Because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may attenuate ankle swelling by CCBs, those parameters were evaluated according to a similar design during amlodipine (10 mg UID) and enalapril (20 mg UID) combined (n=10). As a control, the effect of enalapril monotherapy (10 and 20 mg UID for 2 weeks each) was evaluated in a third series of patients (n=8). Amlodipine (5 mg UID) increased leg weight without modifying postural vasoconstriction (the percent skin blood flow decrease from horizontal to dependent position), which indicates that extravascular fluid shift was independent of postural skin vasoconstriction. At 10 mg UID, however, amlodipine blunted postural vasoconstriction and increased leg weight further, which suggests that skin blood flow autoregulation limited additional fluid transfer. Both parameters normalized after drug withdrawal. Enalapril per se did not affect cutaneous vasomotion or leg weight but reduced the amount of dependent fluid extravasation by the CCB despite a persistent antagonism for postural vasoconstrictor responses.",2,E

The inclusion criteria were that eligible subjects had been in receipt of a kidney transplant for at least 12 months, had at least 10 teeth and had not received specialist periodontal treatment. The age, gender, current drug regimen and dosage were recorded for each participant and alginate impressions taken of both arches. The presence and severity of gingival overgrowth were scored from plaster models.; A higher proportion (72%) of the amlodipine group were categorised as having gingival overgrowth compared with only 53% of the nifedipine group, chi square=4.5, p<0.05. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between the presence or absence of gingival overgrowth (dependent variable) and age, gender, time since transplant, dose of cyclosporin A, centre in which the patient was treated, and the calcium channel blocker used (independent variables). Independent predictors of gingival overgrowth in this multivariate analysis were whether the individual was treated with amlodipine or nifedipine (p=0.01) and whether the individual was young or old (p=0.01). Within the multivariate analysis, the odds ratio for amlodipine to be associated with gingival overgrowth compared with nifedipine was 3.0 (confidence interval 1.3-6.9).; The prevalence of gingival overgrowth in renal transplant recipients maintained on cyclosporin A and nifedipine is lower than those treated with cyclosporin A and amlodipine.",2,E

Pretreatment with the study drug started two weeks before PTCA and continued until four months after PTCA. The primary angiographic end point was loss in minimal lumen diameter (MLD) from post-PTCA to follow-up, as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Clinical end points were death, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery and repeat PTCA (major adverse clinical events).; Angioplasty was performed in 585 patients (92.1%); 91 patients (15.6%) had coronary stents implanted. Follow-up angiography suitable for QCA analysis was done in 236 patients in the amlodipine group and 215 patients in the placebo group (per-protocol group).

A rare association between FMD and alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) deficiency has been reported. We compared the alpha 1-AT phenotype distribution in 83 patients with renal arterial FMD with those published for Australian populations. alpha 1-AT phenotyping was performed by isoelectric focusing between pH 4.2 and pH 4.9 on polyacrylamide gels with PiM1M2, PiFM (non-deficiency alleles), PiMS and PiMZ (deficiency alleles) markers. Following phenotyping, alpha 1-AT genotyping was performed in 10 patients to confirm the presence of S and/or Z alleles. The phenotype distribution and allele frequencies were similar to those reported for normal subjects from two Australian populations (72 (86.7%) PiMM phenotype, one (1.2%) PiFM, seven (8.4%) PiMS, two (2.4%) PiMZ and one (1.2%) PiSZ), suggesting that alpha 1-AT deficiency is not a common aetiological factor in renal arterial FMD. However, despite FMD being three times less common in males than females, and carotid artery dissection being a rare occurrence, a male with PiMS deficiency phenotype presented with internal carotid artery dissection and had bilateral renal artery FMD. Further, a patient with PiSZ deficiency phenotype was one of two sisters with FMD and was more severely affected than her PiMM normal phenotype sibling. These two patients from the present series together with nine culled from the literature with alpha 1-AT deficiency phenotype and FMD suggest that the chance combination of alpha 1-AT deficiency and FMD may predispose to severe manifestations of FMD.",5,E

Its abuse can, however, be associated with massive hypertension resulting in strokes, ruptured aneurysms, or myocardial infarction. We examined the utility of isradipine, a dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonist, in treating d-methamphetamine induced hypertension and evaluated its effects on cognitive function, both of which are mediated by dopaminergic mechanisms. D-methamphetamine dose-dependently increased all vital signs (systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, and pulse rate) parameters. Isradipine significantly reduced d-methamphetamine-induced increases in diastolic and mean arterial pressure; however, this potentially beneficial therapeutic effect was offset by a significant reflex rise in pulse rate. D-methamphetamine also improved attention, accuracy of reasoning ability, and performance on computerized cognitive function tasks. D-methamphetamine's cognitive improving effects were not altered significantly by isradipine. Isradipine increased the false responding rate but was without significant effect on any other attentional task, or on reasoning ability, or performance.

Primary data sources were located via MEDLINE or cross-citation. No attempt was made to be comprehensive or inclusive of the literature because fewer than 10% of citations are discussed. Instead, emphasis was placed on new developments in diagnosis, therapeutics and practice patterns. Controlled therapeutic trials and pathophysiological observations are emphasized. Achalasia is a rare disease of failed lower sphincter relaxation and aperistalsis. Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), an equally rare disease, is defined by nonpropagated esophageal contractions. Nonspecific motility disorders, including nutcracker esophagus and hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter, are identified only by manometry and are 10 times as prevalent. Neuromuscular pathology is evident only with achalasia (myenteric plexus neuron destruction). Pharmacological therapies have limited efficacy with achalasia, more limited efficacy with DES and no efficacy with the nonspecific motility disorders. More efficacious therapies for the nonspecific disorders are directed at associated reflux disease or psychiatric disorders. Pneumatic dilation is effective therapy for achalasia in 72% of instances but frequently requires repeat dilation and is complicated by a 3% perforation rate. Surgical myotomy is effective in 88% of patients with achalasia; morbidity from thoracotomy has been the major limitation but has been sharply reduced with a laparoscopic approach. In conclusion, although it has been suggested that esophageal motility disorders are distinct clinical entities, critical review of the literature supports this only in the case of achalasia, a disease of well defined pathophysiology, functional disturbance and therapies. This clarity diminishes progressively for DES and nonspecific esophageal motility disorders.",4,E

However, because both agents exert a negative chronotropic effect, their combined use may cause bradyarrhythmias with resultant symptoms of cerebral, coronary, and systemic hypoperfusion. We describe our clinical experience with patients who had cardiovascular adverse drug reactions (CVADRs) with combination therapy. This prospective study included 26 patients who had CVADRs among 2,574 admissions during a 2-year period. The study group included 14 men and 12 women with a median age of 73 years. Various combinations of calcium antagonists and beta-blockers were associated with the CVADRs. The most frequent pharmacologic combination was diltiazem plus propranolol. The CVADRs were the cause for hospital admission in 10 patients, an associated cause in nine patients, and developed during hospitalization in seven patients. Cardiac bradyarrhythmias were found in 22 patients. These rhythm abnormalities resolved within 24 h after discontinuation of the offending drugs. Temporary transvenous pacemaker insertion was necessary in only one patient with complete atrioventricular block. Twenty-two patients recovered, two patients died of pump failure not associated with CVADRs, and in two patients, the CVADRs contributed to the patients' death. CVADRs are not uncommon in elderly patients with ischemic heart disease and/or hypertension treated with the concomitant use of calcium antagonist and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Use of calcium antagonist plus beta-blocker may unpredictably cause serious hemodynamic events, marked suppression of sinus node activity, and prolongation of atrioventricular conduction in some patients. Enhanced therapeutic monitoring may be warranted when calcium antagonists are combined with beta-blockers.",3,E

However adenosine is expensive and injectable verapamil currently is scarcely available. While intravenous diltiazem has been shown to be useful for terminating PSVT, the efficacy of esmolol in this regard has not been evaluated previously. Hence these latter two drugs were studied for their efficacy in terminating PSVT.; A prospective, randomised, crossover study was undertaken in patients presenting with hemodynamically tolerated PSVT to the ICCU. While 50 patients had been planned for the trial, the study had to be prematurely terminated after 32 patients had been enrolled due to the marked superiority of diltiazem. Two sequential doses with a 5 minute interval of either drug were administered before crossover. Diltiazem was given in a dose of 0.25 mg/kg while the esmolol dose was 0.5 mg/kg.; Diltiazem terminated PSVT in all the 16 patients in whom it was given as the first drug. The 12 patients who did not respond to esmolol were also effectively treated with diltiazem. Thus totally 28/28 patients responded to diltiazem while only 4/16 patients responded to esmolol (p < 0.001). Of the 28 patients who responded to diltiazem, in 13 patients the second bolus of diltiazem worked after the first one had failed. No significant adverse effects were seen.; Intravenous diltiazem is highly effective and safe for terminating PSVT. When the first bolus is ineffective, the second bolus given after 5 minutes usually succeeds. Esmolol in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg has poor efficacy for terminating PSVT, even when 2 boluses are administered.",6,E

The patient cohort consists of 5294 males and 5602 females with a mean age of 59.6 and 60.3 years, respectively. Concomitant disorders and risk factors in the cohort are: smoking 22%, ischemic heart disease 3.0%, previous myocardial infarction (MI) 2.0%, previous stroke 1.5%, diabetes mellitus 7.0%, and renal impairment 0.3%. There were no differences between the treatment groups in these respects. The blood pressure treatment goal is a target diastolic blood pressure of < or =90 mmHg or a 10% diastolic blood pressure reduction from the inclusion pressure. In the treatment group randomized to a diltiazem-based treatment strategy, blood pressure was 174/106 mmHg at baseline and 156/90 mmHg after 12 months of follow-up on active treatment. In the group randomized to a conventional treatment strategy, baseline blood pressure at randomization was 173/106 mmHg and 153/90 mmHg after 12 months on active therapy. The NORDIL study will terminate on October 31, 1999 and the final results should be available by mid-2000.",I,I

During a median follow-up of 40 months, 32 patients suffered a cardiovascular death and 29 a non-fatal myocardial infarction.; Prognostic implications of results from exercise tests were assessed in a multivariate Cox model which included sex, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Maximal ST-segment depression, especially if >/=2 mm and occurring after exercise, as well as exercise duration independently predicted cardiovascular death. Similar results were obtained for the combined end-point of cardiovascular death+myocardial infarction. Among patients with a positive exercise test at baseline, verapamil reduced the maximal ST-depression more markedly than metoprolol (P<0. 01). However, when the treatment given and treatment effects on ST-segment depression were added to the Cox model, no impact on prognosis could be detected for either cardiovascular death alone or combined with myocardial infarction. Anginal pain carried no prognostic information.; Marked ST-segment depression during and after exercise, and a low exercise capacity independently predicted an adverse outcome in patients with stable angina pectoris, whereas anginal symptoms had no predictive value. Short-term treatment effects on ischaemia did not seem to influence prognosis. Post-exercise ischaemia should be examined carefully when evaluating patients with stable angina pectoris.",I,6

Each of 40 randomized patients was treated in sequence with two of the five agents (balanced incomplete block design). Treatment periods lasted 6 wk and were separated by a 3-wk washout period. Changes in BP from baseline with the study substances were compared through analysis of variance. Office diastolic BP, our primary outcome variable, was most effectively lowered by atenolol, with all four post hoc differences between atenolol and the remaining substances being statistically significant. Reductions in office systolic and daytime ambulatory BP were not significantly different among the five compounds. However, atenolol reduced mean nighttime ambulatory diastolic and systolic BP more effectively than did amlodipine, enalapril, or losartan (but not hydrochlorothiazide). Severity of sleep-disordered breathing and well-being during the day were not significantly influenced by any of the study compounds. Our findings are in accordance with the hypothesis that an overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is an important mechanism behind the development or maintenance of hypertension in patients with OSA.",5,E

The International Nifedipine GITS Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) study is a double-blinded outcome comparison of calcium channel blockade with diuretics in high-risk patients aged 55 to 80 years. Dynamic randomization between nifedipine once daily and hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride was performed to ensure that approximately equal numbers of patients in the 2 groups had each of the major cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with isolated systolic hypertension were also separately randomized. Atenolol or enalapril was the mandatory second-line drug. In 5669 patients who completed the 18-week titration, BP fell from 172+/-15/99+/-9 mm Hg (mean+/-SD) while receiving placebo to 139+/-12/82+/-7 mm Hg. Twenty-six percent of patients required 2 drugs, and 4% required 3 drugs. Patients with diabetes were the most resistant to treatment, requiring second and third drugs 40% and 100% more frequently than patients without diabetes and achieving marginally the highest final BP, for any risk group, of 141+/-13/82+/-8 mm Hg. Age, smoking, gender, hypercholesterolemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, and existing atherosclerosis had little (<1 mm Hg) or no influence on BP at the end of titration, but all except smoking slightly reduced the initial response of either systolic or diastolic BP. Patients with isolated systolic hypertension were slightly more responsive than average to treatment. Our findings suggest that in patients at high absolute risk of cardiovascular complications from hypertension, the risk factors themselves do not prevent the recommended BP targets from being achieved.",5,E

Earlier studies combining short acting drugs from these classes require multiple dosing and were associated with poor compliance. Availability of longer acting compounds allows once daily administration to avoid the inconvenience of a multiple daily dose. It was decided to perform a randomised double blind, crossover study with the long acting calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the long acting ACE inhibitor lisinopril, given either alone or in combination in essential hypertension. Twenty four patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 104 mm Hg received amlodipine 2.5 mg and 5 mg, lisinopril 5 mg and 10 mg, and their combination as per a prior randomisation schedule. Supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at weekly intervals. Higher doses of both the drugs individually or in combination were used if the target supine DBP below 90 mm Hg was not achieved. There was a significant additional blood pressure lowering effect with the combination when compared either with amlodipine or lisinopril alone. Five mg amlodipine and 10 mg lisinopril monotherapy achieved the target blood pressure in 71% and 72% patients respectively. The combination of 2.5 mg amlodipine with 5 mg lisinopril produced a much more significant lowering of blood pressure in a higher percentage of patients than that with an individual low dose.",2,E

We studied 24 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension in a double-blind random-sequence crossover study comparing placebo with amlodipine titrated up from 5 to 10 mg daily. After 1 month of treatment, the subjects performed 20 min of a frustrating cognitive task. At baseline before task, amlodipine significantly reduced systolic pressure (128.9+/-8.2 mm Hg v 140.3+/-10.7 mm Hg, P < .001), diastolic pressure (81.7+/-7.7 mm Hg v 90+/-7.5 mm Hg, P < .001), and total peripheral resistance (37.5+/-15 v 45.6+/-23.7 mm Hg/L/min, P < .05), while elevating baseline norepinephrine levels (2286+/-731 pmol/L v 1788+/-546 pmol/L, P < .001). Blood pressure during the stress task was significantly less with amlodipine than with placebo (systolic 142.3+/-12.3 mm Hg v 150.9+/-14.6 mm Hg, P < .001; diastolic 87.9+/-8.4 mm Hg v 97.7+/-9.3 mm Hg, P < .001), whereas norepinephrine was significantly higher (2754+/-1007 pmol/L v 1970+/-740 pmol/L, P < .001). There were no significant differences in cardiac output, plasma lipids or lipoproteins, or markers of platelet activation. Heart rate increased significantly during stress, but there was no significant difference between amlodipine and placebo either at baseline or during stress. Our conclusion is that amlodipine reduces blood pressure at baseline and during mental stress, but raises basal and stress-related plasma catecholamines. This finding may have implications for the recent controversy over the safety of calcium channel antagonists, and suggests the potential relevance of combining amlodipine with adrenergic blockers.",5,E

Their severity, in turn, can be measured by assessing the distress that they cause. Our goal was to relate the magnitude of the distress induced by treatment with calcium-channel blocking agents to the change in quality of life assessed through psychosocial instruments in patients treated with calcium-channel blocking agents, either for hypertension or for angina pectoris.; Four hundred seventy-five patients with angina pectoris were randomized to double-blind treatment with PPR (physiological pattern release) verapamil hydrochloride, amlodipine besylate, amlodipineatenolol combination, or placebo. In addition, 557 hypertensive patients were randomized either to PPR verapamil or nifedipine GITS (gastrointestinal system). Both studies were double-blind.; Significant differences in treatment of angina pectoris or hypertension, were not found between the regimens. Overall quality of life also failed to show a significant difference in either group. In both groups, however, remarkable concordance was found between the degree of distress associated with specific symptoms and a change in quality of life. An unchanged, stable symptom distress was associated with a significant improvement in the quality of life of about 0.1 SD. Improvement or erosion of symptom distress represented by 1 step was associated with a 0.1- to 0.2-SD change. The extreme change in symptom distress was associated with a substantially larger change in global quality of life.; The magnitude of symptom distress or relief associated with symptoms in 2 patient populations correlated strongly with a shift in quality of life. The assessment of distress associated with symptoms provides valuable additional information on drug therapy.",8,8

We postulated that this agent would reduce cardiac events in patients after acute myocardial infarction treated initially with thrombolytic agents-a clinical application previously unexplored with heart-rate-lowering calcium antagonists.; A prospective, randomised, double-blind, sequential trial was done in 874 patients with acute myocardial infarction, but without congestive heart failure, who first received thrombolytic agents. Patients received either 300 mg oral diltiazem once daily, or placebo, initiated within 36-96 h of infarct onset, and given for up to 6 months. The trial primary endpoint was the cumulative first event rate of cardiac death, non-fatal reinfarction, or refractory ischaemia. Additional prespecified endpoints included several composites of non-fatal cardiac events (non-fatal reinfarction combined with refractory ischaemia, all recurrent ischaemia, or the need for myocardial revascularisation). The diagnosis of ischaemia, whether refractory or recurrent, and the need for myocardial revascularisation, was always based on objective electrocardiographical evidence of ischaemia, either at rest or on exertion.; For the trial primary endpoint, 131 events occurred in the 444 placebo patients and 97 events in the 430 diltiazem patients (hazard ratio 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02; p=0.07). For non-fatal cardiac events, diltiazem treatment was associated with a relative decrease (0.76; 0.58-1.00) in the combined event rate of non-fatal reinfarction and refractory ischaemia. There was a similar decrease in the composite non-fatal endpoints of non-fatal reinfarction combined with all recurrent ischaemia (0.80; 0.64-1.00) and non-fatal reinfarction combined with the need for myocardial revascularisation (0.67; 0.46-0.96). The need for myocardial revascularisation alone was significantly reduced by 42% (0.61; 0.39-0.96). No major safety issues were encountered.; Diltiazem did not reduce the cumulative occurrence of cardiac death, non-fatal reinfarction, or refractory ischaemia during a 6-month follow-up, but did reduce all composite endpoints of non-fatal cardiac events, especially the need for myocardial revascularisation.",1,E

Our purpose was to emphasize the importance of newborn poisoning among general poisoning in childhood. The age of infants ranged from 10 min to 25 days (0.82 +/- 2.81 days). Forty-seven (65.2%) infants were poisoned before or during delivery. Of the 47 infants' mothers, 46 had preeclampsia or eclampsia, and 27 received only magnesium sulfate; nine magnesium sulfate + diazepam; four magnesium sulfate + nifedipine; and the others received various drug combinations. Aside from these, one mother had Addison's disease and she used long-term dexamethasone during her pregnancy. In the newborn period, five (6.9%) infants inhaled organophosphate insecticides; eight (11.1%) ingested corrosive agents (four benzalkonium chloride; three chlorhexidine gluconate + cetrimide and an infant ammonium); four (5.5%) were poisoned by overdose of digoxin; three (4.1%) ingested overdose of phenobarbital; and two (2.7%) received acepromazine maleate. In addition, each infant ingested diphenoxilate HCL + atropine sulfate, pipenzolate bromid and tizanidine HCL. Follow-up period of the infants ranged from 24 hr to 26 days (0.82 +/- 2.81 days). The mortality rate was 17% (12/72). Death was not noted in the infants who were followed with poisoning after delivery. The causes of death were as follows: sepsis in four infants, meningitis, respiratory distress syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis in two infants each, and the effects of overdose of magnesium sulfate and diazepam in two infants, respectively. In conclusion, we would like to stress that newborn infants whose mothers received magnesium sulfate or another drug during pregnancy or delivery should be closely monitored, and calculation of drug doses should be carefully taught to hospital nurses. When baby-rooms are disinfected with organophosphate insecticides in a hospital or house, infants should be removed from the room for at least 24 hr, and use of drugs should be explained in detail to the mothers.",4,E

We conducted a follow-up study with a nested case-control analysis of 322 448 subjects who received antihypertensive drugs. Cases were people who had a first-time diagnosis of aplastic anaemia during January 1, 1988 through September 30, 1997. The risk estimate of aplastic anaemia was calculated for all antihypertensive drugs. For the nested case-control analysis, six controls were matched to each case on age, sex and general practice attended. Odds ratios compared the risk of idiopathic aplastic anaemia for all antihypertensive drugs relative to nonusers.; There were 13 cases of newly diagnosed idiopathic aplastic anaemia. The estimated risk of aplastic anaemia per 100 000 users was 0.8 (95% CI 0.1, 4.7) for calcium channel blockers, 1.4 (95% CI 0.5, 4.1) for beta-adrenoceptor blockers, 2.3 (95% CI 0.6, 8.6) for angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 5.9 (95% CI 1.6, 21.5) for users of other antihypertensive drugs.

However, hypotension may be caused by the negative inotropic and vasodilating effects of verapamil. In vitro and animal data suggest that calcium pretreatment may minimize the effects of verapamil on cardiac output and blood pressure. Case reports suggest that intravenous calcium may be useful for both prevention and reversal of the hemodynamic effects of verapamil. A number of small clinical trials have been performed, suggesting that calcium administered prior to intravenous verapamil results in a decreased incidence of hypotension. The most common adverse effect of intravenous calcium is flushing.; Calcium pretreatment prior to intravenous calcium-channel blocker administration should be considered in patients in whom further reductions in blood pressure may precipitate hypoperfusion or worsen underlying cardiovascular status. A dose of calcium gluconate 1 g (ionized calcium 90 mg) administered over three minutes is recommended for preventing or lessening the hypotensive effect of verapamil without affecting the antiarrhythmic effects of verapamil.",3,E

Studies with a particular interest for heart failure physicians have been reviewed. OPTIME-CHF: Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure. OPTIME-CHF was a randomised-controlled trial comparing a 48-h infusion of Milrinone or standard therapy in 951 patients recruited over a 2-year period. Patients were excluded if the investigator believed their clinical condition mandated inotropic therapy. Patients were randomised within 48 h of admission for an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure to receive Milrinone or placebo infision for 48 h. Of the patients 43% were diabetics, 70% were receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, 25% were already on a beta-Blocker, and 34% had atrial fibrillation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in length of hospital stay during the index admission, subsequent readmissions and days in hospital over the following 60 days. Subjective clinical assessment scores were also no different. There was an average admission rate over the next year of one per patient in both groups. However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of sustained hypotension in the Milrinone group, which accounted for all of the increased adverse event rates for the active therapy. The 60-day mortality was 10% in both groups. This and previous trials of the oral formulation of Milrinone have now clearly demonstrated a lack of benefit with Milrinone in either during acute exacerbations of or in stable severe chronic heart failure [Packer M, Carver JR, Rodeheffer RJ et al. Effect of oral Milrinone on mortality in severe chronic heart failure. N Engl J Med 1991;325:1468-1475.].

Perinatal outcomes were then recorded and analyzed for all study participants and their neonates.; Laboratory analysis yielded 22 (18.33%) heterozygous carriers of Factor V Leiden mutation among preeclamptic women and 3 (2.97%) heterozygous carriers among the healthy controls; differences between the two groups were found to be statistically significant [p < 0.001, the relative risk (RR) = 6.17, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.90-20.02]. Homozygous MTHFR mutations were found in 8 of 120 (6.67%) preeclamptic women and in 6 of the 101 (5.94%) healthy controls evaluated. Among preeclamptic women, episodes of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet (HELLP) syndrome were reported in 7 of 22 (31.81%) of those with Factor V Leiden mutation and in 11 of 98 (11.22%) of those who were negative for the mutation. Group differences were determined to be statistically significant (p < 0.015, RR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.24-6. 48). Perinatal indicators collected from the two groups included frequency of intrauterine growth retardation, birth weight, and gestational age. No statistically different perinatal outcomes were found between Factor V Leiden positive and negative preeclamptic women. In addition, MTHFR gene polymorphism did not appear to be correlated with the development of preeclampsia.; Although the frequency of Factor V Leiden mutation appears to be significantly higher among preeclamptic women, the mechanism of pathogenesis and potential influence on perinatal outcomes is not yet well understood. Relatively high rates of HELLP syndrome among those with Factor V Leiden mutation suggest that this thrombogene mutation may play a significant role in hemostatic system activation. Our results suggest that the role of MTHFR polymorphism and other factors such as folic acid supplementation will require more extensive analysis in controlling worldwide morbidity and mortality associated with this important maternal condition.",5,E

10917075,Silent myocardial ischaemia in the elderly.,Aged; Humans; Myocardial Ischemia; Prevalence; Prognosis,"Deedwania, P C","Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death and disability in the elderly. Several recent studies have shown that silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI) is a common manifestation of CAD, especially in the elderly. As many as 40% of elderly patients with no prior history of CAD may have underlying asymptomatic disease and up to 50% of elderly patients with known CAD might have evidence of SMI. The results of studies in elderly patients with CAD have also shown that SMI might exist despite antianginal therapy that is considered adequate for symptom control. In order to diagnose such residual SMI, the clinician would need to perform 24- to 48-hour Holter monitoring in the ambulatory setting while the patient is performing routine daily activities. Although a number of anti-ischaemic drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of SMI, available data suggest that beta-blocker given alone or in combination with a nitrate compound or calcium antagonist provides the best therapeutic choice. The long term benefit of SMI suppression in elderly patients has not been established. Future studies need to evaluate the clinical benefits of therapy given for SMI in the elderly.",5,E

In addition, factors having an independent association with these 2 outcomes were identified. Of 817 non-Q-wave patients, 81 (9.9%) died during 12 to 52 months of follow-up. The unadjusted mortality rate was 42% lower in patients randomized to calcium antagonist therapy than placebo (7.2% vs 12.4%, p = 0.010). Non-Q-wave patients who died during follow-up were older than patients who survived (62 vs 58 years, p = 0.001). Other factors found to have an independent association with all-cause mortality included diuretic use (RR 2.79), diabetes mellitus (RR 2.86), and New York Heart Association class >I (RR 1.73). The covariate adjusted all-cause mortality risk ratio associated with randomization to calcium antagonist therapy was 0.65 (95% confidence interval [0.40 to 1.05, p = 0.079]). Overall, 153 patients (18.7%) died or had nonfatal reinfarction. The unadjusted combined event rate was 31% lower in patients randomized to calcium antagonist therapy than to placebo (15.2% vs 21.9%, p <0.006). Factors found to have an independent association with cardiac events included age, diabetes (RR 2.82), diuretic use (RR 2.04), and previous AMI (RR 1. 71).

It has a circadian pattern prominent in the early AM, which has been thought to be due to a surge of sympathetic stimulation. We postulated that the distribution of events in advanced heart failure, with chronic sympathetic activation, would be more uniform implicating other potential mechanisms.; We analyzed data from Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Trial (PRAISE). Sudden deaths were analyzed by time of death in 4-h and 1-h blocks for uniformity of distribution in the entire cohort, and in the prespecified ischemic and nonischemic stratum. Further analyses were undertaken in the treatment groups of amlodipine and placebo, and among those receiving background therapy of aspirin and warfarin.; Sudden deaths in the overall cohort showed a nonuniform distribution with a PM peak but not an AM peak. The ischemic stratum also showed a PM peak, but sudden deaths within the nonischemic stratum were uniformly distributed. Neither amlodipine treatment nor aspirin or warfarin use altered the distribution.; Sudden death in advanced heart failure did not show an AM peak, suggesting that circadian sympathetic activation did not strongly influence these events. The PM peak noted is likely complex in origin and was not affected by antiischemic or antithrombotic medications.",I,E

This was a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. After a 2-week washout period, patients in group A (n = 37) received amlodipine 10 mg and patients in group B (n = 38) received doxazosin 4 mg for 6 weeks. All patients then received reduced-dose combination therapy (amlodipine 5 mg and doxazosin 2 mg) for 6 weeks. Subsequently, patients received 6 weeks of monotherapy with the alternate medication (group A received doxazosin 4 mg and group B received amlodipine 10 mg). During both monotherapy periods, doxazosin and amlodipine significantly reduced systolic and diastolic BP (P < .001 v baseline). BP further decreased with combination therapy (P < .01 v monotherapy). The percentage of patients with Stage 2 hypertension who achieved a target BP of < 140/< 90 mm Hg increased from 78% with monotherapy to 94% with combination therapy. Fewer adverse effects were observed during combination therapy. It is concluded that there is an additional fall in blood pressure when reduced doses of doxazosin and amlodipine are used in combination for the treatment of hypertension, suggesting that doxazosin should be considered as an effective add-on treatment to calcium-channel blockers.",2,E

We compared the effects of the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine once daily with the diuretic combination co-amilozide on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in high-risk patients with hypertension.; We did a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial in Europe and Israel in 6321 patients aged 55-80 years with hypertension (blood pressure > or = 150/95 mm Hg, or > or = 160 mm Hg systolic). Patients had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. We randomly assigned patients nifedipine 30 mg in a long-acting gastrointestinal-transport-system (GITS) formulation (n=3157), or co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg [corrected] plus amiloride 2.5 mg; n=3164). Dose titration was by dose doubling, and addition of atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke. Analysis was done by intention to treat.; Primary outcomes occurred in 200 (6.3%) patients in the nifedipine group and in 182 (5.8%) in the co-amilozide group (18.2 vs 16.5 events per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.10 [95% CI 0.91-1.34], p=0.35). Overall mean blood pressure fell from 173/99 mm Hg (SD 14/8) to 138/82 mm Hg (12/7). There was an 8% excess of withdrawals from the nifedipine group because of peripheral oedema (725 vs 518, p<0.0001), but serious adverse events were more frequent in the co-amilozide group (880 vs 796, p=0.02). Deaths were mainly non-vascular (nifedipine 176 vs co-amilozide 172; p=0.81). 80% of the primary events occurred in patients receiving randomised treatment (157 nifedipine, 147 co-amilozide, difference 0.33% [-0.7 to 1.4]).; Nifedipine once daily and co-amilozide were equally effective in preventing overall cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications.

Treatment consisted of nitrendipine, with the possible addition of enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, or both. Patients enrolled in the Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Side Project were classified according to daytime systolic ABP into 1 of 3 subgroups: nonsustained hypertension (<140 mm Hg), mild sustained hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg), and moderate sustained hypertension (>/=160 mm Hg). At baseline, patients with nonsustained hypertension had smaller ECG voltages (P<0.001) and, during follow-up, a lower incidence of stroke (P<0.05) and of cardiovascular complications (P=0.01) than other groups. Active treatment reduced ABP and CBP in patients with sustained hypertension but only CBP in patients with nonsustained hypertension (P<0.001). The influence of active treatment on ECG voltages (P<0.05) and on the incidence of stroke (P<0.05) and cardiovascular events (P=0.06) was more favorable than that of placebo only in patients with moderate sustained hypertension.; Patients with sustained hypertension had higher ECG voltages and rates of cardiovascular complications than did patients with nonsustained hypertension.

Our aim was to prospectively compare the effects of amlodipine and ACEI (enalapril) on renal function in hypertensive patients with renal impairment due to chronic glomerulonephritis and essential hypertension. A total of 72 hypertensive patients with serum creatinine (Cr) > 1.5 mg/dL were randomly allocated to treatment with either drug. During a 1-year period, 33% of the patients treated with ACEI dropped out due to adverse events, whereas 9% of patients with amlodipine dropped out. Data of 28 patients were available for analysis of more than 1-year follow-up. Reductions in blood pressure were comparable between the amlodipine (from 165/101 to 138/81 mm Hg) and ACEI groups. Serum Cr increased from 2.1+/-0.8 (SD) to 2.6+/-1.0 mg/dL with amlodipine (n = 16), but the difference was equivalent to that with ACEI (n = 12). Creatinine clearance (Ccr) in the moderate dysfunction group (basal Cr, 1.5 to 2.0 mg/dL) changed from 36+/-10 to 33+/-11 mL/min (not significant) with amlodipine, and the change was similar to that noted with ACEI. Annual declines in Ccr with amlodipine (-3.7 mL/min/year) and ACEI (-2.6 mL/min/year) were comparable, and both tended to be smaller than the annual decline in glomerular filtration rate reported in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (-6 mL/min/year). Serum potassium was increased significantly (P < .01), from 4.5+/-0.4 to 5.3+/-0.8 mEq/L, only in the ACEI group. This 1-year prospective study demonstrated the effect of amlodipine on renal function to be likely the same as that of ACEI. Furthermore, amlodipine was better tolerated than ACEI for hypertensive patients with renal dysfunction.",5,E

Ocular physiology, ocular comfort and tear volume were assessed. The trial was repeated with nicardipine in an aqueous gel vehicle. Tears were collected and assessed for protein concentration and protein profile, using electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Nicardipine induced conjunctival redness and symptoms of dryness and irritation. There was no change in total tear protein concentration or volume. An increase in a 68 kDa protein was observed, this was probably due to conjunctival vessel dilation and leakage of albumin. The adverse symptomatology and increased conjunctival redness experienced with nicardipine make it an undesirable treatment for dry eye.",4,E

After a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients entered a 12-week, open-label, dose-titration period. The candesartan cilexetil dose was increased from 8 to 16 mg once daily; amlodipine (5 mg once daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily), and additional medication were also added sequentially if necessary. Patients then entered a final 4-week, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled withdrawal period of candesartan alone. A total of 216 patients were recruited. After a 2-week run-in period on placebo tablets, mean sitting blood pressure (BP) was 175/108 mm Hg. At the end of the 12-week dose-titration/maintenance period, mean sitting BP fell to 141/88 mm Hg. In 67 patients who were randomized to placebo and had their candesartan withdrawn, there was a highly significant increase in mean systolic/diastolic BP (13/6 mm Hg) compared with those patients who continued with candesartan (ANCOVA, P:<0.0001). In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil is an effective BP-lowering drug when used alone or in combination with amlodipine or amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of moderate-to-severe essential hypertension. The drug was well tolerated throughout the investigation period.",3,E

Indirectly evaluate tubular reabsorption of albumin-Tc99m. Test the hypothesis that amlodipine decreases renal tubular reabsorption of albumin in diabetic hypertensive subjects.; Fourteen diabetic and hypertensive subjects (DH) (average plasma creatinine: 94 mmol/L) and 6 normal subjects (average plasma creatinine: 82 mmol/L) had previously been assessed for albumin-Tc99m PC. Eleven of these 14 DH subjects were then randomized to diltiazem 300 mg/daily (6 subjects) or amlodipine 10 mg/daily (5 subjects). Their glomerular filtration, glomerular pressure and albumin-Tc99m PC were then assessed on the 3rd, 6th, and 12th month of the study.; Albumin-Tc99m PC obtained from serial blood draws: A decrease in PC between months 0 and 3 from 14 to 10.6 cc/min was observed in subjects treated with amlodipine but subjects on diltiazem showed PC stability (from 11.9 to 12 cm3/min). PC obtained from urinary excretion: Amlodipine and diltiazem treated subjects showed PC stability. Plasma volume in amlodipine treated subjects decreased from 156 to 127% and diltiazem treated subjects from 128 to 117%.; A decrease in PC obtained with plasma measurements and stability of PC based on urinary excretion measurements tends to identify a decrease in plasma volume. A decrease in albumin-Tc99m tubular reabsorption was not observed. The estimate of albumin PC with Tc 99m labelled albumin measurements still needs to be validated.",5,E

End points were changes in average systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) from the two clinic visits before and after conversion. In addition, data were collected and analyzed with regard to adverse drug reactions, average dosage of the alternative calcium channel blocker, number of additional antihypertensives begun or discontinued, and number of dosage changes in antihypertensives within the two visits after conversion, and the overall cost impact of conversion. Average systolic blood pressure was reduced from 141.6 +/- 15.1 to 139.2 +/- 15.3 mm Hg after the conversion (NS). Average diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced from 74 +/- 9.5 to 72.6 +/- 10.1 mm Hg after conversion (p=0.032), as was MAP (97.0 +/-q 9.3 to 94.8 +/- 10.0 mm Hg, p=0.026). Five patients had other changes in therapy made concurrently at the time of conversion, and 19 had changes after conversion. When these patients were excluded from analysis, the reduction in systolic blood pressure after conversion was significant (141.4 +/- 14.5 to 137.7 +/- 14.3 mm Hg, p=0.022), as were reductions in diastolic blood pressure (74.4 +/- 9.4 to 71.7 +/- 9.8 mm Hg, p=0.014) and MAP (96.7 +/- 9.1 to 93.7 +/- 9.3 mm Hg, p=0.007).

The overall cost impact of the conversion was a net savings of $14,858/year for each 100 patients converted.; Conversion from amlodipine to other calcium channel blockers resulted in statistically significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure and MAP, and was safe as well as cost-effective. Conversion to calcium channel antagonists other than felodipine or less than equal dosages of felodipine may require dosage titration. When converting patients from amlodipine, dosages usually should be equal to those of felodipine; if converting to other calcium channel antagonists, the need for adjustments should be anticipated.",3,E

Long term persistence on treatment was quantified by survival curve analysis.; The amlodipine (5188 patients) and felodipine (2630 patients) groups were similar in terms of sex ratio (66.7% female) and age (mean 74 years). Average compliance rates for amlodipine patients (67.9%) were significantly higher than for felodipine patients (66.2%) (P<0.01), and switch rates were 5.4-fold higher in the latter group. Patients initiating treatment with felodipine had a 27% increased rate of discontinuation (relative risk 1.27) compared with the amlodipine patients. In addition, patients with at least one year of follow-up data were more likely to maintain amlodipine as part of their antihypertensive regimens than felodipine. After adjustment, medical resource consumption patterns were similar for both groups except for an increase in the number of specialist visits for the amlodipine treatment group.; Patients who received amlodipine, either as a monotherapy or as part of a multitherapy regimen, were more compliant and persistent with their treatment than patients on felodipine. The data suggest that amlodipine may provide more effective long term hypertension control than felodipine, and that the two drugs are not therapeutically equivalent.",8,8

Efficacy was assessed by comparing pretreatment blood pressure (BP) to follow-up BP obtained in our outpatient Pediatric Nephrology clinic. Thirty-two (58%) patients achieved BP control with amlodipine alone, and 31 (55%) patients received amlodipine twice daily. Eleven patients received amlodipine as a suspension. Mean amlodipine dose was 0.16 +/- 0.12 mg/kg/day; there was an inverse relationship between patient age and amlodipine dose. Follow-up BP were significantly lower than pretreatment BP: systolic BP fell from 129 +/- 12 to 122 +/- 12 mm Hg (P = .004), and diastolic BP fell from 78 +/- 13 to 70 +/- 19 mm Hg (P = .003). A small, clinically insignificant increase in heart rate (from 91 +/- 19 beats/min to 99 +/- 26 beats/min; P = .02) occurred during amlodipine treatment. Adverse effects reported included dizziness (three patients), fatigue (two patients), flushing (two patients), and leg edema (one patient). All improved with dose reduction. We conclude that amlodipine provides effective BP control without significant adverse effects in children with hypertension, and can be used as monotherapy in most children. Young children appear to require significantly higher doses per kilogram of body weight than older children. Twice-daily dosing may be required in many children to achieve BP control. Detailed pharmacokinetic studies are needed to confirm these observations.",4,E

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and compliance of amlodipine with that of standard long-acting calcium channel blockers (felodipine or nifedipine) in hypertensive children. A randomized, prospective, crossover study of 11 hypertensive children (9-17 years of age, 10 renal transplant patients) was performed with electronic monitoring of compliance. Each treatment arm was 30 days. No significant differences were observed in mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) between amlodipine and the other calcium channel blockers. Using 24-h blood pressure monitoring there were no significant differences over each drug treatment period in both mean day-time and night-time SBP and DBP. Patient compliance was similar in both the amlodipine and the nifedipine/felodipine treatment periods. These data suggest that amlodipine is as effective in pediatric nephrology patients as nifedipine and felodipine. Amlodipine may be optimally suited for treatment of young children because at present it is the only calcium channel blocker which can be administered once daily as a liquid preparation.",5,E

An effective antihypertensive treatment is therefore required. Calcium antagonists are used to treat hypertension because, owing to their mechanism of action, they can provoke systemic, as well as coronary vasodilatation. In this study the authors aimed to evaluate the activity and tolerability of diltiazem compared to ramipril in a group of elderly patients suffering from essential arterial hypertension.; A controlled single-blind study was performed in which patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, A and B, consisting of 25 patients each, treated respectively with 300 mg sustained-release diltiazem or 5 mg ramipril in a single daily dose. The study lasted 6 months and evaluated systolic and diastolic pressure and heart rate.; The evolution was positive in all patients in Group A and most patients in Group B, with the normalisation of both systolic and diastolic values. Heart rate showed a more persistent fall in Group A, but this was expected owing to the mechanism of action of diltiazem. No patient in Group A had to suspend treatment, whereas one patient in Group B had to interrupt therapy following the onset of a persistent cough.; Both treatments resulted in similar changes in systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. In the light of these results, it can be affirmed that, at an oral dose of 300 mg/day, sustained-release diltiazem was found to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension in the aged.",2,E

Glucose metabolism was evaluated by an oral glucose tolerance test; Of the 52 patients recruited, 47 (21 rilmenidine and 26 amlodipine) completed the 4-month treatment period. The intention-to-treat analysis showed a comparable reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) with the two anti-hypertensive treatments (rilmenidine -13.9/-13.5 mmHg; amlodipine - 17.6/-15.0 mmHg). Insulin concentrations under basal conditions and 2 h after a standard oral glucose load did not change significantly after treatment in both groups. Plasma glucose under basal conditions and 2 h after a standard oral glucose load as well as the area under the plasma glucose concentration curve tended to decrease in the rilmenidine group and to increase in the amlodipine group so that the changes in these parameters were significantly different between the two study groups (P= 0.041, P = 0.042 and P = 0.015, respectively). Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen and PAI-1 activity were only decreased in the rilmenidine group (not statistically significant).; Our results demonstrate that rilmenidine and amlodipine have a comparable anti-hypertensive effect but only rilmenidine is able to improve glucose metabolism.",2,E

A randomised double blind parallel group study versus placebo was performed, in order to assess the efficacy of atenolol combined with amlodipine in the treatment of stage I-II essential hypertension not controlled by atenolol alone. Twenty-four-hour arterial blood pressure monitoring showed that amlodipine added to atenolol produced a statistically significant reduction of blood pressure values compared with placebo in patients whose blood pressure was not controlled by atenolol alone.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to relieve pain in arthritic patients but a side effect is sodium retention and consequent elevation of blood pressure (BP). The effect of dihydropyridine calcium blocking drugs is relatively independent of sodium intake, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors' effects can be blunted by a high-sodium diet. This study compared the effects of indomethacin with placebo in elderly patients with essential hypertension who had been controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. Indomethacin 50 mg twice daily or placebo was administered for 3 weeks in a double-blind crossover study to patients controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. The response was assessed by ambulatory BP measurement. Indomethacin raised BP and lowered pulse rates in patients taking enalapril but had little effect in patients receiving amlodipine. The difference caused by indomethacin between the two groups was 10.1/4.9 mm Hg increase in BP and a 5.6 beats/min fall in pulse in people taking enalapril. Addition of indomethacin to patients taking either drug caused a rise in weight and a fall in plasma renin. It is postulated that the effect is due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which causes sodium retention. In patients taking amlodipine, the fall in plasma renin ameliorates the effect of sodium retention on BP. In patients taking enalapril, plasma renin falls but this is not translated into an effect because of the blockage of converting enzyme. Thus, the full effect of sodium retention on BP is expressed. In patients treated with indomethacin, fewer patients may respond to ACE inhibitors. However, the major problem is the patient who intermittently takes indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which, if a person is treated by an ACE inhibitor causes BP to go out of control. In such patients amlodipine would appear to be a preferred choice to enalapril.",3,E

Then high salt (200 to 250 mmol Na+/day) was added to the placebo treatment for 3 weeks (weeks -3 to 0). Those patients who demonstrated an increase in SDBP > or =5 mm Hg from the low to high salt diet were considered salt sensitive and were randomized into a 4-week (weeks 0 to 4) double-blind treatment period of either isradipine 2.5 to 10 mg twice a day, enalapril 2.5 to 20 mg twice a day, or placebo.

The 1,079 patients whose diastolic blood pressure remained between 95 and 115 mm Hg were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind therapy with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/ benazepril 20 mg, nifedipine 30 mg or nifedipine 60 mg (study 1), and amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, amlodipine 5 mg or amlodipine 10 mg (study 2). Both doses of the calcium antagonist/ACE inhibitor combination therapy lowered diastolic pressure as much as the high dose and significantly better than the lower dose of calcium antagonist monotherapy (with either nifedipine or amlodipine). However, 15% of patients in the nifedipine high-dose monotherapy group and 24% in the amlodipine high-dose monotherapy group presented with some form of edema. In contrast, the incidence of edema was similar for patients treated with both combination therapy and low-dose calcium antagonists.

Thus cognitive improvement was superior by 67% in the felodipine group compared to amiloride/HCT (p < 0.05).; In this study a pronounced improvement of mental performance occurred in patients treated with felodipine. Since the cognitive gain was significantly superior to amiloride/HCT treatment there must be an additional blood pressure-independent effect of felodipine, such as enhancing microcirculation.

Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) and blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were performed simultaneously to detect any association between ischemic episodes on the ECG and changes in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate with and without nifedipine. Increased oxygen demand due to an increased systolic BP and heart rate was associated with ischemic episodes without nifedipine, while those with nifedipine were accompanied by a fall in diastolic BP and a rapid increase in heart rate. This slow-release twice-daily formulation of nifedipine may induce myocardial ischemia through a heart-rate increase and a decrease in coronary blood flow due to lower diastolic BP in patients with severe coronary artery disease. A once-daily formulation of nifedipine might be of great value for such patients.",2,E
11116287,Vatanidipine hydrochloride: a new long-lasting antihypertensive agent.,Animals; Antihypertensive Agents; Arteriosclerosis; Calcium Channel Blockers; Clinical Trials as Topic; Dihydropyridines; Humans; Hypertension; Nitrendipine,"Matsumura, Y; Hayashi, K","Vatanidipine is a novel dihydropyridine (DHP)-type calcium channel blocker with slow-onset pharmacological actions, which are probably due to both its slow uptake into vascular tissues and resistance in its approach to the calcium channel binding site. Vatanidipine once incorporated into vascular tissues is not easily released, even by repeated washing, thus resulting in a long-lasting action of the agent. A slow-onset and long-lasting hypotensive action was observed in various experimental hypertensive models. Clinical trials using human subjects with essential hypertension indicated that vatanidipine exerts an antihypertensive effect with a slow onset and long duration. In spite of its potent hypotensive effect, the incidence of adverse effects by vatanidipine administration has been reported to be lower than that in cases of nitrendipine. In addition to its vasodilatory effects, vatanidipine efficiently suppressed noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerve endings, thus suggesting this agent exhibits a beneficial effect in the treatment of hypertensive patients, in which the reflex activation of peripheral sympathetic nerves is unfavourable to antihypertensive therapy. In a double-blind study, vatanidipine did not show reflex tachycardia, despite producing a potent and long-lasting hypotensive effect, in contrast to the administration of nitrendipine. In an animal study, vatanidipine exhibited a protective effect against cerebrovascular lesions, through a mechanism independent of its hypotensive effect. In addition, a renoprotective effect was also observed in experimental hypertensive models. In cholesterol-fed rabbits, vatanidipine exerted an anti-atherosclerotic action, which is probably attributable to the inhibitory action of the agent on low-density lipoprotein oxidation. In essential hypertensive patients, the plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride decreased after vatanidipine treatment, thus suggesting that this agent may have a therapeutic potential in preventing such vascular diseases as atherosclerosis. Taken together, vatanidipine appears to be a novel and useful antihypertensive agent, which can both prevent target-organ damage and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",6,E

The favorable effects of verapamil on coronary microcirculation might indicate its use in early stage DCM. We assessed the safety of long-term combination therapy of verapamil and enalapril and its effects on both left ventricular function and myocardial perfusion compared with enalapril alone in 18 patients with DCM (15 men, 3 women; mean age, 50+/-9 years) without overt heart failure (NYHA class I-II). At baseline and after 6 months of randomized treatment with either enalapril (10-20 mg) (nine patients, group 1) or enalapril (10-20 mg) and verapamil (120-240 mg) (nine patients, group 2), left ventricular function was assessed at rest, during handgrip, and during bicycle exercise by equilibrium radionuclide angiography. Mean MBF was measured at rest and after dipyridamole by positron emission tomography (PET) and 13N-ammonia as a flow tracer. At baseline, the two groups had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at rest, which was further impaired during isometric exercise, but increased at peak bicycle exercise. MBF was similarly reduced in the two groups at rest and during dipyridamole. During treatment, no adverse events occurred in either group. After 6 months there was no significant difference in the main study variables either between the two groups or within each group before and after treatment. Long-term combination therapy with verapamil and enalapril is safe in patients with DCM without overt heart failure. Despite no favorable effect on myocardial perfusion, combined treatment prevented deterioration of left ventricular function, similarly to enalapril alone.",4,E

Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm is believed by many physicians to be superior to rate control only. However, there are no prospective data that compare both therapeutic strategies.; The Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF) trial was a randomised trial in 252 patients with atrial fibrillation of between 7 days and 360 days duration, which compared rate (group A, 125 patients) with rhythm control (group B, 127 patients). In group A, diltiazem was used as first-line therapy and amiodarone was used in group B. The primary study endpoint was improvement in symptoms related to atrial fibrillation.; Over the entire observation period of 1 year, a similar proportion of patients reported improvement in symptoms in both groups (76 responders at 12 months in group A vs 70 responders in group B, p=0.317). Amiodarone administration resulted in pharmacological restoration of sinus rhythm in 23% of patients. Walking distance in a 6 min walk test was better in group B compared with group A, but assessment of quality of life showed no differences between groups. The incidence of hospital admission was higher in group B (87 [69%] out of 127 vs 30 [24%] out of 125 in group A, p=0.001). Adverse drug effects more frequently led to a change in therapy in group B (31 [25%] patients compared with 17 [14%] in group A, p=0.036).; With respect to symptomatic improvement in patients with atrial fibrillation, the therapeutic strategies of rate versus rhythm control yielded similar clinical results overall. However, exercise tolerance is better with rhythm control, although hospital admission is more frequent. These data may serve as a basis to select therapy in individual patients.",I,I

The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects of calcium antagonists and other antihypertensive drugs on major cardiovascular events.; We undertook a meta-analysis of trials in hypertension that assessed cardiovascular events and included at least 100 patients, who were randomly assigned intermediate-acting or long-acting calcium antagonists or other antihypertensive drugs and who were followed up for at least 2 years.; The nine eligible trials included 27,743 participants. Calcium antagonists and other drugs achieved similar control of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared with patients assigned diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, or clonidine (n=15,044), those assigned calcium antagonists (n=12,699) had a significantly higher risk of acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.43], p=0.0003), congestive heart failure (1.25 [1.07-1.46], p=0.005), and major cardiovascular events (1.10 [1.02-1.18], p=0.018). The treatment differences were within the play of chance for the outcomes of stroke (0.90 [0.80-1.02], p=0.10) and all-cause mortality (1.03 [0.94-1.13], p=0.54).; In randomised controlled trials, the large available database suggests that calcium antagonists are inferior to other types of antihypertensive drugs as first-line agents in reducing the risks of several major complications of hypertension. On the basis of these data, the longer-acting calcium antagonists cannot be recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension.",I,I

We did separate overviews of trials comparing active treatment regimens with placebo, trials comparing more intensive and less intensive blood-pressure-lowering strategies, and trials comparing treatment regimens based on different drug classes.; The hypotheses to be investigated, the trials to be included, and the outcomes to be studied were all selected before the results of any participating trial were known. Individual participant data or group tabular data were provided by each trial and combined by standard statistical techniques.; The overview of placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors (four trials, 12,124 patients mostly with coronary heart disease) revealed reductions in stroke (30% [95% CI 15-43]), coronary heart disease (20% [11-28]), and major cardiovascular events (21% [14-27]). The overview of placebo-controlled trials of calcium antagonists (two trials, 5520 patients mostly with hypertension) showed reductions in stroke (39% [15-56]) and major cardiovascular events (28% [13-41]). In the overview of trials comparing blood-pressure-lowering strategies of different intensity (three trials, 20,408 patients with hypertension), there were reduced risks of stroke (20% [2-35]), coronary heart disease (19% [2-33]), and major cardiovascular events (15% [4-24]) with more intensive therapy. In the overviews comparing different antihypertensive regimens (eight trials, 37,872 patients with hypertension), several differences in cause-specific effects were seen between calcium-antagonist-based therapy and other regimens, but each was of borderline significance.; Strong evidence of benefits of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists is provided by the overviews of placebo-controlled trials. There is weaker evidence of differences between treatment regimens of differing intensities and of differences between treatment regimens based on different drug classes. Data from continuing trials of blood-pressure-lowering drugs will substantially increase the evidence available about any real differences that might exist between regimens.",I,I

Ultrasonographic evaluations of femoral vascular changes have not been studied prospectively.; In the Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm (APSIS), 809 patients with stable angina pectoris were studied prospectively during double-blind treatment with verapamil or metoprolol. Ultrasonographic assessments of intima-media thickness, lumen diameter and plaques in the carotid and femoral arteries were evaluated in a subgroup of 558 patients (182 females) with a mean age of 60 +/-7 years, and related to the risk of cardiovascular death (n = 18) or non-fatal myocardial infarction (n = 26), or revascularization (n = 70) during follow-up (median 3.0 years). Univariate Cox regression analyses showed that carotid intima-media thickness and plaques were related to the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Femoral intima-media thickness was related to cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction, as well as to revascularization, whereas femoral plaques were only related to the latter. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, previous cardiovascular disease and lipid status, carotid intima-media thickness failed to predict any cardiovascular event, whereas carotid plaques tended (P = 0.056) to predict the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Femoral intima-media thickness (P < 0.01) and plaques (P < 0.05) were also related to the risk of revascularization after adjustments.; Carotid and femoral vascular changes were differently related to cardiovascular events. Carotid intima-media thickness was a weak predictor of events, whereas femoral intima-media thickness predicted revascularization. Plaques in the carotid artery were related to cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction, whereas plaques in the femoral artery were related to revascularization. Evaluations of plaques provided better prediction than assessments of intima-media thickness in patients with stable angina.",I,E

The value of VER for treating solid tumors is still a matter for debate.; We performed a prospective study in 99 patients with anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast carcinoma (MBC), to assess the clinical effect of oral VER given in association with chemotherapy. Instead of retreating patients with anthracycline, we used a partially noncross-resistant regimen (VF), combining vindesine (VDS) and 5-fluorouracil given as a continuous infusion (5-FU CI). Patients were randomly assigned to two cohorts. One cohort (47 patients) was treated in 28-day cycles, each involving the administration of VDS (3 mg/m2 i.v. bolus on days 1 and 10) and 5-FU CI, (400 mg/m2/day i.v. from day 1 to day 10). The other cohort (52 patients) received the same VDS and 5-FU treatment and an additional oral VER treatment (240 mg/day divided in 2 doses), from day 1 to day 28 of each cycle. Patients were treated until progression.; The treatment was well tolerated and no side effects that could be attributed to VER were detected. Patients treated with VER had longer overall survival (OS) (median OS: 323 vs. 209 days, P = 0.036) and a higher response rate (27% vs. 11%, P = 0.04) than those not given VER. Progression-free survival (PFS) was also longer but the difference was not statistically significant (median PFS: 4.6 and 2.7 months for the VER and non-VER groups respectively, P = 0.6).; This clinical trial demonstrates that a chemosensitizer, such as VER, can increase the survival of MBC patients with acquired anthracycline resistance.",I,6

A secondary aim was to relate the efficacy of the free and fixed combinations with pharmacokinetic profiles.; This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised three-way crossover multi-centre study. BP was measured for 26 h using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), which was performed on the last day of the three treatment phases.; Mean sitting BPs, measured during the trough period with ABPM, were significantly lower with both the free and fixed combinations of metoprolol and felodipine than placebo (141/83 mmHg free, 140/83 mmHg fixed, 156/93 mmHg placebo). The mean BPs measured over 24 h using ABPM were 143/82 mmHg, 140/82 mmHg and 158/93 mmHg for the free, fixed and placebo treatment arms, respectively. The trough-to-peak ratios (T:P) were 75% and 79% for the systolic BP and 70% and 70% for the diastolic BP for the free and fixed combinations, respectively. Pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed identical plasma concentration-time curves for felodipine given as the free or fixed combination. Comparison of the plasma concentration-time curves for metoprolol revealed a delay in the release rate from the fixed combination formulation. No significant differences in BP control between the active treatments were noted during this period. Of 26 patients entered into the study, 3 withdrew during active phase for non-drug-related reasons. No patient withdrew from active treatment due to treatment-related adverse events. The frequency of adverse event reporting for the fixed combination of felodipine and metoprolol was similar to that for placebo (60% and 58%, respectively).; The results suggest that once-daily dosing with either the free or fixed combination of felodipine 5 mg and metoprolol 50 mg produces a significant sustained reduction in systolic and diastolic BP with similar plasma concentration profiles over a 24-h period.",5,E

Outcomes assessed at one, three, six, and 12 months included exercise duration and quality of life.; Exercise duration significantly improved from baseline in both groups. There was no difference in outcome between the groups (Med +40% v HBA +20%, p = NS). The heart rate profile on exercise was similarly slowed in both groups compared to baseline. Quality of life significantly improved in both treatment arms for the modified Karolinska questionnaire (KQ) (Med +50% v HBA +50%, p = NS) and the Nottingham health profile (NHP) (Med +40% v HBA +20%, p = NS). However, for the individual symptom scores of each questionnaire more were improved in the Med group (KQ-Med 6 improved v HBA 4, NHP-Med 3 v HBA 1). Left ventricular function was equally preserved by both treatments during follow up.; In these patients control of ventricular response rate with either HBA + VVIR pacemaker or atrioventricular modifying drugs + VVI pacemaker will lead to a significant improvement in exercise duration and quality of life. Rhythm regulation by HBA did not confer additional benefit, suggesting rate control alone is necessary for the successful symptomatic treatment of these patients in permanent AF.",2,E

Recent randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the benefits of treating hypertension in the elderly.; This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, in elderly (> or =65 years of age) patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 114 mm Hg).; This was an open-label, multicenter, 10-week, general-practice study involving patients >18 years of age. Patients with malignant or secondary hypertension or unstable angina were excluded, as were those who had experienced an acute myocardial infarction or stroke in the preceding 3 months or had been treated with an alpha-blocker in the preceding 6 months. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment schedules: amlodipine monotherapy or combination therapy and amlodipine given once daily in the morning or in the evening. Approximately 50% of patients would receive a morning dose, and approximately 80% would receive amlodipine as monotherapy. The paired t test was used to assess the significance of differences from baseline values, with significance set at P < 0.05.; A total of 5135 patients received amlodipine and were included in the tolerability analysis. Of these, 3511 of 3628 patients (96.8%) <65 years and 1471 of 1507 patients (97.6%) > or =65 years (including 336 of 349 [96.3%] > or =75 years) were included in the efficacy analysis. Significant reductions (P < 0.05) in blood pressure were noted in all groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The equivalence of efficacy in all age groups was seen in terms of reduction in blood pressure (reduction of 21/15 mm Hg in patients <65 years of age, 25/16 mm Hg in those > or =65 years of age, and 26/17 mm Hg in those > or =75 years of age) compared with baseline.

Metoprolol (50-100 mg twice daily) and diltiazem (60-120 mg three times daily) were randomly assigned for 6 weeks to patients in each group, and then patients were crossed over for further 6 weeks after a washout period of 2 weeks. Antianginal efficacy was assessed by clinical and exercise parameters.; In patients with SII, the clinical responder rate was better with metoprolol than with diltiazem (90 vs. 60%, respectively), and on ETT, metoprolol produced significant improvement in the total exercise time (p< 0.01), time to 1 mm ST depression (p <0.01), time to angina (p <0.01), and a significant decrease in peak rate-pressure product (p<0.001), whereas diltiazem had no significant effect on exercise parameters.

A sample of values was validated in a reference laboratory. Apoliprotein (apo) A-I and B were measured by the turbidimetric immunoassay using commercial kits in part of the cohort. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were made. Criteria for the diagnosis of CHD were based on history, cardiovascular examination, and Minnesota coding of resting electrocardiograms. Coronary heart disease was diagnosed in about 7% of the subjects. Participants were divided into four categories depending on their triglyceride levels: I = < 100 mg/dl (282 men, 400 women), II = 100-139 mg/dl (204 men, 228 women), III = 140-212 mg/dl (188 men, 180 women), and IV = > or = 212 mg/dl (155 men, 99 women).; After adjustment for age, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, smoking, and body mass index by logistic regression analysis, and after assigning the CHD risk of 1 to Category I, the relative risk for men and women combined rose to 1.42 in Category III (p<0.045) while it diminished to 0.94 in Category IV (p = 0.79). In women, the odds ratio (OR) rose gradually up to 1.78 (p< 0.025) in Category III, only to decline in Category IV. The OR in men was slightly, insignificantly, and equally elevated in Categories III and IV. Patients with CHD in Category III were not distinguished from those in Category IV by the studied risk parameters. It was suggested that high risk for CHD--particularly in subjects with slightly elevated or normal cholesterol levels-is often not reflected by extreme increases of fasting triglycerides but best by modest elevations (140-212 mg/dl), which serve better as a marker of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles. This knowledge may prove to be of value in population screening and individual risk assessment.",I,8

After bedtime dosing (9 PM to 11 PM, this delivery system delays drug release for 4 to 5 h, and provides the highest concentrations of verapamil between 6 AM and noon. The study results showed that CODAS-verapamil produced its greatest antihypertensive effect during this morning period (6 AM to 12 noon) and also provided effective trough diastolic blood pressure reductions at 200, 300, and 400 mg. Significant trough systolic blood pressure reductions were achieved only with the 300- and 400-mg doses. The nighttime dosing regimen was not associated with excessive blood pressure (BP) reductions during the sleeping hours, when the antihypertensive effect was generally slightly less than that of the 24-h mean reduction. The CODAS-verapamil provides enhanced BP reduction during the morning period when compared with other time intervals of the 24-h dosing period.",5,E

However, there is some controversy as to how they should be used. Our first aim was to clarify how the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, benidipine, affects the quantitative relationship between blood pressure (BP) and physical activity. The second aim was to determine whether there is a relationship between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and physical activity in patients with hypertension when treating with a short-acting (nifedipine) or long-acting (benidipine) calcium channel blocker. In Study 1, ambulatory BP and physical activity were measured simultaneously in 27 patients with hypertension before and after 6 months with benidipine. In Study 2, ambulatory BP and physical activity were measured simultaneously in 16 patients with hypertension before (placebo) and after 6 weeks of crossover treatment with nifedipine and benidipine. In Study 1, there was no difference in the SBP change caused by physical activity between the pre- and posttreatment periods. In Study 2, SBP was significantly related to physical activity in the placebo (16/16) and benidipine (16/16) groups but not in the nifedipine (12/16) group. The lowest BP during day-time and nighttime in the nifedipine group were significantly lower than those in the benidipine group. Plasma renin activity (ng/mL/h) was significantly higher in the nifedipine group (1.20+/-1.05) than in the placebo (0.57+/-0.59) and benidipine (0.75+/-0.78) groups. These findings indicate that nifedipine might interfere with the adaptation mechanism of BP changed by physical activity and that the activated renin-angiotensin system might cause cardiac events.",5,E

Patients received barnidipine at a dose titrated to achieve a sitting DBP > or = 90 mmHg or a decrease in sitting BDP > or = 10 mmHg. If necessary, another antihypertensive agent was added to achieve normalisation of blood pressure. In the first year, normalisation of blood pressure was achieved in 91% of patients. This was maintained in 91% and 81% of patients in the second and third years, respectively. At the end of treatment in both years, over 60% of patients remained on barnidipine monotherapy (10 or 20 mg/day). A low incidence of adverse events possibly or probably related to barnidipine (10 or 20 mg/day) monotherapy was reported in the first and second years with headache, peripheral oedema and palpitations the most commonly reported. In the third year of follow-up, only one adverse event, an ECG abnormality, was considered to be possibly related to the study medication. The effective 24 hour control of blood pressure with barnidipine monotherapy was confirmed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of 20 patients. These patients were given 6 week regimens of both barnidipine (20 mg/day) and placebo. Office and 24 hour ambulatory blood pressures were recorded at the end of each treatment phase. Barnidipine lowered blood pressure to a significantly greater extent than placebo both at night and during the day. Adverse events were classified as mild or moderate and fewer adverse events were reported with barnidipine treatment compared with placebo. Barnidipine monotherapy (20 mg/day) is safe and effective in providing 24 hour control of blood pressure.

Prospective studies revealed that a blood pressure reading of < 130/80 mm Hg significantly retards the progression of nephropathy whereby patients with proteinuria > 1 g/d benefit from even lower BP readings. In diabetic nephropathy the drugs of choice are inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEI), already in the incipient stage and also in normotensive patients. The importance of ACEI in the treatment of non-diabetic nephropathies was confirmed recently by controlled prospective studies AIPRI and REIN. A maximal renoprotective effect of ACEI probably calls for larger doses than those needed for normalization of BP. Long-term investigations of the renoprotective effect of antagonists of angiotensin AT1 receptors and comparative studies with ACEI resp. are not available. Dihydropyridine blockers of calcium channels with a short-term action (nifedipine) may have a negative influence on the progression of diabetic nephropathy, the effect of dihydropyridines of the second generation is tested in prospective studies. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have a renoprotective action in diabetic nephropathy. In cca two thirds of the patients combined treatment with ACEI and diuretics or with calcium channel blockers is necessary. As to other antihypertensive drugs, vasodilatating beta-blockers and perspectively antagonists of endothelin receptors are useful.",7,E

Another less-appreciated potential drawback is their propensity to cause weight gain in some patients. In 8 evaluable prospective randomized controlled trials that lasted >/=6 months, body weight was higher in the beta-blocker than in the control group at the end of the study. The median difference in body weight was 1.2 kg (range -0.4 to 3.5 kg). A regression analysis suggested that beta-blockers were associated with an initial weight gain during the first few months. Thereafter, no further weight gain compared with controls was apparent. There was no relationship between demographic characteristics and changes in body weight. Based on these observations, the first-line use of beta-blockers in obese hypertensive patients should be reviewed.

Peak reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with nifedipine GITS was 19/15mmHg and the trough reduction was 21/17mmHg, giving a trough-to-peak ratio of 100% for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. When patients received placebo after 4 weeks of active treatment, simulating a compliance failure, amlodipine maintained reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure for at least up to 72h after the last active dose, maintaining 57.71% of the effect for systolic blood pressure and 60.00% for diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, nifedipine GITS effect was rapidly lost during this study phase, with a reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of only 14-16%, 72h after the last active dose.; This study showed that amlodipine and nifedipine GITS reduce blood pressure to about the same extent during chronic treatment. In the case of compliance failure, such as missing one or two doses, amlodipine maintained significant and important antihypertensive effect with the trough-to-peak ratio still over 50% 72h after the last active dose. On the other hand, the coverage of nifedipine GITS was limited to about 36h after the last active dose.",5,E

Following a 4- to 5-week placebo run-in period, patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 90 to 99 mm Hg received candesartan cilexetil 16 mg (n = 123) or amlodipine 5 mg (n = 128) once daily. After 4 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients were uptitrated to candesartan cilexetil 32 mg or amlodipine 10 mg once daily. There were no significant differences between the candesartan cilexetil and amlodipine regimens for reducing BP; mean systolic BP/diastolic BP reductions were -15.2/-10.2 mm Hg versus -15.4/-11.3 mm Hg, respectively (p = 0.88/0.25). Overall, 79% of patients on candesartan cilexetil and 87% of those on amlodipine were controlled (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg). A total of 3.3% of patients on candesartan cilexetil discontinued treatment, compared with 9.4% of patients on amlodipine, including 2.4% versus 4.7% for adverse events and 0% versus 1.6% for peripheral edema, respectively. Peripheral edema, the prespecified primary tolerability end point, occurred with significantly greater frequency in patients on amlodipine (22.1%; mild 8.7%, moderate 11.8%, severe 1.6%) versus patients on candesartan cilexetil (8.9%; mild 8.1%, moderate 0.8%) (p = 0.005). Candesartan cilexetil and amlodipine are both highly effective in controlling BP in patients with mild hypertension. Candesartan cilexetil offers a significant tolerability advantage with respect to less risk of developing peripheral edema.",2,E

Following initial control, 12 nicardipine- and 24 nitroprusside-treated patients required additional titration of their infusions to maintain blood pressure within the targeted range (p < 0.05). No patient suffered a stroke, myocardial infarction, or was returned to the operating room (OR) for bleeding.; Nicardipine administration produced more rapid BP control, most likely related to the administration of a loading dose. In addition to more rapid control, nicardipine-treated patients had less variability in BP and required significantly fewer additional interventions. Although no patient suffered a major event during this study, this study was not powered sufficiently to assess safety.",1,E

Differences in heart rate correction methods, electrocardiogram lead placement, and other internal (eg, genetic, physiologic) and external (eg, food, time of day) factors have confounded the interpretation of this relationship. A comprehensive review of the epidemiologic literature suggests that the corrected QT interval (QTc) is an important but imprecise marker of cardiovascular disease. The association between QTc prolongation and mortality has been identified in patients with cardiac disease but is unclear in patients without cardiac disease. Drug-related prolongation of QTc can clearly increase the risk of torsade de pointes, but this arrhythmia is rarely associated with a QTc of less than 500 ms. It also appears that noncardiac drugs that are associated with QTc prolongation are not identical in their proarrhythmic capacities and that increased exposure via clinically significant drug interactions is a major contributor to the liability of noncardiac drug-induced arrhythmia. Recognition of the aforementioned variables in conjunction with careful QTc measurements assists in establishing a more precise benefit-risk ratio for a specific drug therapy or for arrhythmia risk associated with various pathophysiologic or genetic states.",2,E

At least one stroke trial suggests that patients receiving calcium channel blockers at the time of an acute stroke have worse outcomes than those receiving other or no antihypertensive medications. We hypothesize that the poor outcome may not be related to blood pressure changes but instead may be mediated by competitive inhibition of important enzymes of pyrimidine synthesis whose products are needed to repair nerve cell membranes after an acute stroke. Both drugs acted as competitive inhibitors of the only enzymes that are known to synthesize the nucleotide uridine-5'-phosphate: uridine kinase and orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase. Nifedipine produced Ki values of 28 microM for uridine kinase and 105 microM for orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase. Nimodipine produced Ki values of 20 microM for uridine kinase and 18 microM for orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase. For uridine kinase, these inhibitors bound more tightly than the physiologic substrates uridine or cytidine. For the decarboxylase, the inhibitors bound less tightly than the normal physiologic substrate orotidine-5'-phosphate. Additional experiments are needed to determine whether the concentrations of nifedipine or nimodipine, and of cytidine, uridine, and orotidine-5'-phosphate in human brain, are such that this inhibition would affect stroke outcome.",2,E

Outpatients with chronic stable angina taking at least 2 antianginal medications were studied. Patients were randomized to one of two treatments: optimal adjustment of their usual antianginal medications or conversion to solely long-acting medications (long-acting diltiazem +/- nitroglycerin patches +/- atenolol) with subsequent optimization. The primary outcome was the 3-month change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores. Although no differences in physical limitation scores were noted, patients randomized to receive long-acting medications had improved symptom control (3-month improvement in anginal stability [19.1 vs 5.6, P =.02] and anginal frequency [17.8 vs 5.5, P =.006]), more treatment satisfaction (3-month improvement of 8.2 vs 3.0, P =.057), and better quality of life (3-month improvement of 11.2 vs 5.6, P =.09) compared with patients whose pretrial medications were optimized.

Few clinical studies distinguish effects of CCB as monotherapy. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of two CCB on patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Thirty patients with pretreatment diastolic blood pressures > or = 100 mm Hg were randomly assigned to either nifedipine-GITS or verapamil-SR. Dose titration achieved a diastolic blood pressure of < or = 95 mm Hg or a decrease of > or = 15 mm Hg over 4 weeks. Clinic blood pressure (BP), 24-h ambulatory BP, exercise BP, left ventricular mass, systolic and diastolic function by echocardiography, and coronary flow reserve by split-dose thallium-201 imaging with adenosine were assessed at baseline, end of titration, 3 months and 6 months of treatment. Plasma renin activity, atrial natriuretic peptide, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were assayed. Both drugs caused similar reductions in clinic and 24-h ambulatory BP and similar reductions in left ventricular mass index. Compared to nifedipine-GITS, verapamil-SR produced a significantly lower resting and peak exercise heart rate. Nifedipine-GITS elicited a lower peak exercise systolic BP. At end titration nifedipine-GITS produced lower plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels, no longer apparent by 6 months. Plasma norepinephrine was lower with verapamil-SR, also at end titration and at 3 months, but not at 6 months. Plasma epinephrine and plasma renin activity were unchanged by either drug. There was no difference for systolic or diastolic left ventricular function or coronary flow reserve between the two treatments. Once daily nifedipine-GITS and verapamil-SR are equally effective for reduction of arterial pressure in moderate to severe hypertension. Differences in their hemodynamic profiles and neurohormonal responses are consistent with preclinical pharmacologic characteristics. The clinical implications of their similarities and differences remain to be fully evaluated in outcome studies.",5,E

Antihypertensive drugs which act through different pathophysiological mechanisms might confer specific target organ protection beyond what is already provided by their blood pressure lowering effect.; Thirty-one patients with essential hypertension were randomized to receive long-term treatment with either a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine GITS, 90 mg/day) or an ACE-inhibitor (lisinopril, 20 mg/day). Blood pressure, left ventricular mass, carotid wall thickness and timed urinary albumin excretion were measured at baseline and over the course of 24 months of treatment.; Both regimens significantly lowered mean blood pressure over the 24 months (from 124+/-2 to 103+/-2 mmHg in the lisinopril group and from 122+/-2 to 104+/-1 in the nifedipine group). Overall, end-organ damage improved with persistent blood pressure control. However, the two treatments had different specific effects. Lisinopril induced a more pronounced reduction of the left ventricular mass index (from 56+/-3 to 52+/-2 g/m2.7, P< 0.05) and urinary albumin excretion (from 34+/-15 to 9+/-2 microg/min, P< 0.01), while nifedipine achieved a greater reduction of carotid intima plus media thickness (from 0.8+/-0.06 to 0.6+/-0.06 mm, P< 0.01).; Blood pressure control does help reduce the severity of organ damage in patients with essential hypertension. Different antihypertensive treatments may confer additional specific cardiorenal and vascular protection regardless of blood pressure control.

Distributions of each type of cell were expressed as percentages of mAb-labeled cells in relation to total number of nucleated cells in a counting zone. Significances of differences between groups were tested by means of the Kruskal-Wallis test, and between pairs of results by means of the Mann-Whitney U-test.; The proportion of CD8-labeled cells was significantly higher in connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium in the nifedipine group than in the controls (P = 0.014).

It is a clinicopathologic syndrome that was originally described in obese, diabetic females who denied alcohol use but in whom the hepatic histology was consistent with alcoholic hepatitis. This typical patient profile has been expanded and is now recognized to occur even in normal weight males without overt abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism. Although originally believed to be a benign clinical entity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is now recognized as a cause of progressive fibrotic liver disease with adverse clinical sequelae. It is important to emphasize that nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is best considered one type of a larger spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that is a consequence of insulin resistance and ranges from fat alone to fat plus inflammation, fat plus ballooning degeneration, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the latter being the most serious form. As with any disease, the clinical importance of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is related to its prevalence and natural history. Recent studies using different methodologies indicate that in the general population the prevalence of fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is approximately 20% and 3%, respectively. These prevalence rates are increased in certain subpopulations such as obesity and type II diabetes. Of greater concern is the recognition that cirrhosis and liver-related deaths occur in approximately 20% and 8% of these patients, respectively, over a 10-year period. Risk factors for these adverse clinical symptoms include patients older than the age of 45, the presence of diabetes or obesity, an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio > 1 and hepatic histology.

A strong correlation between mean fibrillatory intervals and action potential duration was found, both before and after verapamil.; Verapamil caused shortening of refractoriness and increase in spatial dispersion of refractoriness in patients with chronic AF. This implies that verapamil is not useful in reversing the remodeling process in these patients.",I,2

Unit costs of amlodipine and enalapril were applied to the daily dosages of individual patients to calculate the total costs and average costs per patient in each treatment group in the clinical trial on an intent-to-treat basis. Efficacy rates were used to calculate the average treatment costs per success in blood pressure control. Although not statistically significant, amlodipine treatment resulted in a higher efficacy (89.5%) vs. enalapril (85.2%). The average costs per amlodipine-treated patient were consistently lower (-$112.30) than for the enalapril-treated patient by week 50. Treatment with amlodipine resulted in an average cost per success of $609 per patient compared with $772 per enalapril-treated patient. A sensitivity analysis revealed that, in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension over the 50-week treatment period, amlodipine would remain less costly than enalapril, with a decrease in the cost of enalapril of up to 17%, and would remain more cost effective, with a 21% decrease in the cost of enalapril.",5,E

Functional outcomes were graded using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).; Of the 123 patients identified, favorable outcomes (GOS 4 and 5) were achieved in 74.8%. The incidence of DIND was 19.5%. Hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilutional (HHH) therapy was used in 10 patients (8.1%) and no patients were treated for DIND by endovascular means. Seven patients (5.7%) had a poor functional outcome or death because of DIND and two of these were related to complications of HHH therapy.

Inhaled nitric oxide, a vasodilator that acts selectively on the pulmonary circulation, has revolutionized the treatment of this condition. However, inhaled nitric oxide has not proven effective in all patients, particularly those with congenital diaphragmatic hernias or meconium aspiration syndrome. Furthermore, large clinical trials of inhaled nitric oxide have failed to demonstrate significant differences in mortality between nitric oxide-treated and control infants with PPHN. Other therapeutic approaches to PPHN have been limited by a relative lack of specificity for the pulmonary circulation, and have received much less attention. Pharmacologic approaches, including pulmonary surfactants, prostacyclin, endothelin antagonists, Ca(2+)-channel blockers, magnesium sulfate, and tolazoline, have exhibited varying degrees of efficacy in lowering pulmonary vascular pressures in humans and/or animals. A number of these agents are also effective when used in combination. For example, phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been reported to act synergistically with inhaled nitric oxide. Surfactants also appear to be useful in PPHN, particularly in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, when used in combination with other therapies. Surfactant lavage and other novel therapies may also be effective in combination therapy of meconium aspiration syndrome. Further studies should be directed at defining the optimal therapies in specific clinical settings. Validation of multiple therapeutic modalities for PPHN, including inhaled nitric oxide, will allow for rational, combined vasodilator strategies that are specific for the underlying pathophysiology in each patient.",4,E

Only the sitting SBP and the sitting DBP were significantly lowered by fosinopril and verapamil SR. Because reduction in both SBP and DBP in elderly hypertensives has been shown to be beneficial, these findings take on further importance when considering the choice of medication for antihypertensive therapy in the elderly. The increase in norepinephrine in the fosinopril-treated patients may explain why patients treated with long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone or in combination with diuretics rarely complain of orthostatic symptoms.",2,E

Despite overwhelming evidence that uncontrolled hypertension is responsible for a sizeable number of adverse health-related outcomes, control of the disease remains considerably suboptimal. Available data demonstrate that in order to achieve adequate blood pressure control, a large number of patients require therapy with more than one medication. Fixed dose combination antihypertensive therapy has many advantages over other treatment options. Positive effects on blood pressure control, rates of adherence, adverse effects and cost have been identified. Amlodipine/benazepril (Lotrel), Novartis) is a fixed dose combination product indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Although not currently recommended as first-line therapy, studies confirm that this combination of a long-acting calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor possesses substantial blood pressure lowering capabilities. Whereas adverse events tend to become more frequent with increasing doses of antihypertensive monotherapy, the rate of adverse events attributed to amlodipine/benazepril in clinical trials often correlates with rates ascribed to placebo. Amlodipine/benazepril is capable of sustaining blood pressure control over a 24 h period and appears to be minimally affected by an occasional dose omission. Unlike the older calcium antagonists, amlodipine is unlikely to cause alterations in myocardial contractility. Additionally, the amlodipine/benazepril combination product costs less than the same therapy administered as the individual components. It is, therefore, reasonable to consider therapy with amlodipine/benazepril in appropriate patients after an adequate trial of antihypertensive monotherapy.",5,E
11336618,The current status of antihypertensive treatments: into the new millennium.,Antihypertensive Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Hypertension,"Hardman, T C; Lunnon, M W","In this short review, we present a historical perspective of the treatment of hypertension, highlight some current issues and look to the possible future of antihypertensive therapy. The distribution of blood pressure within the population adopts a continuous, albeit somewhat skewed, distribution, so what constitutes hypertension? Conventionally, the disease has been defined as a level of blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg. Accepting this 'arbitrary' definition infers that approximately one quarter of the adult population in the US are hypertensive [1]. This has significant implications in terms of the impact upon public health. We know that treatment of hypertension can prevent the serious consequences of cardiovascular disease: stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure and renal disease. Thus, it is important that raised blood pressure is both detected and effectively lowered. To what level should blood pressure be reduced. Conventionally, a level of 120/80 mmHg has been used to define normotension but there are indications that under certain circumstances this should not be the target. The question also arises as to whether it matters how blood pressure is treated. The choice of agent may ultimately depend upon the presence of any concomitant condition and risk factors. Recent trial evidence has concluded that therapy selected to treat raised blood pressure should take into account the overall cardiovascular risk profile of the patient [2].",5,E
11346125,Contemporary management of chronic stable angina.,Angina Pectoris; Chronic Disease; Humans; Myocardial Revascularization; Thrombosis,"Staniforth, A D","Chronic stable angina is a common condition with a prognosis that is less benign than is generally appreciated. The optimal treatment strategy of this disorder is unclear, and few anti-ischaemic agents have been rigorously tested in prospectively randomised mortality studies. The evidence base for the anti-ischaemic therapy of chronic angina draws upon data 'borrowed' from studies in acute coronary syndromes, and from studies in chronic angina using surrogate endpoints such as ambulatory silent ischaemia. Such evidence leads us to believe that anti-ischaemic therapy with beta-blockers offers a mortality benefit in chronic angina. In contrast, the mortality benefit of lipid lowering therapy and antiplatelet agents is well proven. Angioplasty offers no mortality benefit in the treatment of chronic angina, although it is more effective than medical therapy alone for the relief of symptoms. In a few patients with high order proximal coronary disease, coronary bypass surgery offers a distinct mortality advantage compared with medical treatment alone. Most patients, however, do not warrant such an approach, and only require surgery for when they remain symptomatic despite adequate medical therapy. Alternative strategies such as cardiac transplantation, transmyocardial laser revascularisation and spinal cord stimulation are now accepted in a subgroup of patients for the treatment of chronic angina refractory to standard therapy.",3,E

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a known risk factor. After renal transplantation, persistent hypertension is an important determinant for the further evolution of LVH. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril) with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) (controlled release nifedipine) in treatment of posttransplant hypertension focusing on changes in LVH.; One hundred fifty-four renal transplant recipients presenting with hypertension (diastolic BP> or =95 mmHg) during the first 3 weeks after transplantation were randomized to receive double-blind 30 mg nifedipine or 10 mg lisinopril once daily.; One hundred twenty-three patients completed 1 year of treatment. Good quality echocardiographic data were available in 116 recipients (62 nifedipine/54 lisinopril) 2 and 12 months posttransplant. Blood pressure was equally well controlled in the two groups throughout the study (mean systolic/diastolic+/-SD after 1 year: 140+/-16/87+/-8 mmHg with nifedipine and 136+/-17/85+/-8 mmHg with lisinopril). Left ventricular mass index was reduced by 15% (P<0.001) in both groups (from 153+/-43 to 131+/-38 g/m2 with nifedipine and from 142+/-35 to 121+/-34 g/m2 with lisinopril). There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups at baseline or at follow-up.; In hypertensive renal transplant recipients with well-controlled blood pressure, there is a regression of left ventricular mass after renal transplantation. The regression of left ventricular mass index is observed to a similar extent in patients treated with lisinopril or nifedipine.",4,E

The aim of the present study was to compare in a randomized design the efficacy of verapamil (intracellular calcium lowering) versus digoxin (calcium increasing) for maintenance of sinus rhythm after ECV.; Ninety-seven patients with persistent AF were randomized to verapamil (n = 49) or digoxin (n = 48) for 1 month before and 1 month after ECV. The first month after ECV, patients recorded heart rhythm using daily transtelephonic monitoring. No additional antiarrhythmic drugs were given. Of the 97 patients, 43 patients (20 verapamil) underwent ECV per protocol. Median previous AF duration was 18 and 26 days for verapamil and digoxin, respectively. There were no differences in atrial dimensions and underlying heart disease between the two groups. The success rate of ECV was 75% versus 83% (P = NS). After 1 month, 47% versus 53% (P = NS) had recurrence of AF. Median time to recurrence was 5 days (range 0 to 26) versus 8 days (range 2 to 28) (P = NS), respectively.; Stand-alone intracellular calcium lowering by verapamil around ECV does not enhance cardioversion outcome.",I,I

In total 320 patients aged 18 - 75 years, with mean sitting diastolic blood pressures of 95 - 115 mmHg, were randomized to treatment with imidapril (n = 157) or nifedipine SR (n = 163). Efficacy evaluations were based on the intent-to-treat principle. On study completion, there was no difference between the groups with respect to the primary efficacy variable of response to treatment (imidapril 63.1%; nifedipine SR 61.3%). After 2 weeks' treatment, clinically relevant decreases in blood pressure were observed in both groups, with a trend towards further reductions until study end. Fewer patients in the imidapril-treated group than the nifedipine group withdrew due to adverse events that occurred on treatment with study medication (3.2% versus 16.0%) or experienced adverse events (40.1% versus 49.7%). In addition, fewer adverse events were causally related to imidapril (24.2%) compared with nifedipine SR (41.7%). These results show that imidapril is effective in the treatment of essential hypertension and is better tolerated than nifedipine SR.",2,E

Patients received either diltiazem, 240 mg/day, or amlodipine, 5 mg/day, for 2 weeks followed by diltiazem, 360 mg/day, or amlodipine, 10 mg/day, for 2 weeks. Standard treadmill exercise testing was the primary efficacy assessment. Patients also recorded incidence of angina attacks and use of glyceryl trinitrate spray. Both treatments gave significant improvement in time to onset of angina and time to maximal exercise. With the exception of amlodipine, 5 mg/day, both treatments gave significant increases in time to 1-mm ST segment depression. Diltiazem, 360 mg/day, gave a significant decrease in rate pressure product. There were no significant treatment differences in any of the exercise test parameters. Both treatments reduced incidence of angina attacks and use of glyceryl trinitrate spray. The incidence of edema was significantly less in patients receiving diltiazem. In conclusion, both treatments were effective in controlling patients' angina, but diltiazem was better tolerated, with a lower incidence of edema.",I,E

Forty patients (two groups of 20 patients each) and 20 control subjects were recruited. Patients were randomised to receive either quinapril or nifedipine retard and the dose escalated to control hypertension. Platelet aggregation studies were assessed serially and beta-thromboglobulin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), von Willebrand factor (vWF) coagulation factors VIIIc, XII and fibrinogen were measured at the beginning and end of the 12-week period. Blood pressure was adequately controlled in all patients in both groups. Platelet function was impaired in certain parameters (slope of the reaction with ADP and collagen and maximum aggregation with collagen) in the patient group compared to controls before treatment and this improved in patients on quinapril but not on nifedipine; likewise beta-thromboglobulin was higher in the patient group and fell significantly in the quinapril group but not those on nifedipine. Measurements of endothelial function and coagulation were normal before treatment and showed no alteration during the study, except in the expected fall in plasma ACE in the quinapril group. The results indicate that the ACE inhibitor, quinapril, has a beneficial effect on platelet function unlike the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine.",5,E

In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, the use of high-dose monotherapy and/or combinations of drugs are necessary to achieve these goals. Fixed-dose combination products may be useful in these patients by reducing the number of daily doses required to control blood pressure.; The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a therapeutic interchange between high-dose calcium channel blocker therapy and a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/ benazepril (Lotrel; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, USA) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.; A total of 75 patients were switched from amlodipine (n = 25), felodipine (n = 25), and nifedipine-GITS (n = 25) to amlodipine/benazepril. Twenty-eight of the 75 patients (37%) were taking either a beta-blocker or a diuretic in addition to the high-dose calcium channel blocker prior to the switch. Blood pressure control, side effects and the cost of the therapeutic interchange were evaluated in the year following the therapeutic interchange.; Sixty-six of the 75 (88%) patients were successfully switched with maintenance of blood pressure control and without the development of new dose-limiting side effects. Reasons for treatment failure after the therapeutic interchange included loss of blood pressure control in five patients and the development of new dose-limiting side effects in four patients. These side effects included cough in three patients and rash in one patient. After accounting for differences in drug acquisition cost and costs related to the switch (clinic and emergency room and laboratory tests), a cost savings of $16030 for all 75 patients was realised in the first year. The per patient-per year cost savings was $214.; Our data indicate that a therapeutic interchange from selected high-dose calcium channel blockers to a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/ benazepril can be successfully accomplished in the majority of patients.",6,E

The pathogenesis and mechanisms responsible for this condition are not fully understood. This study assesses for the presence and localization of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in drug-induced gingival overgrowth tissues. CTGF immunostaining was compared with sections stained with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and CD31 antibodies in order to investigate possible pathogenic mechanisms.; Gingival overgrowth samples were obtained from patients undergoing therapy with phenytoin (n = 9), nifedipine (n = 4), cyclosporin A (n = 5), and control tissues from systemically healthy donors (n = 9). Tissue sections were subjected to peroxidase immunohistochemistry and were stained with CTGF and TGF-beta1 polyclonal primary antibodies. Possible relationships between CTGF staining and angiogenesis were also studied using an anti-CD31 antibody as a marker for endothelial cells. Staining was analyzed by computer-assisted quantitative and semiquantitative methodology at 5 defined sites in all samples based on the location of specific landmarks including epithelium and underlying connective tissues.; Cellular and extracellular CTGF content in phenytoin gingival overgrowth tissues was significantly (P<0.05) higher compared to the other gingival overgrowth tissues and the controls. Higher CTGF staining in phenytoin gingival overgrowth tissues was accompanied by an increased abundance of fibroblasts and connective tissue fibers. No strong association of CTGF staining with TGF-beta1 or CD31 staining was found.; The data from the present study show significantly higher CTGF staining in phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth tissues compared to controls, cyclosporin A-, or nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth. Moreover, semiquantitative analyses of histologic samples support the concept that the phenytoin overgrowth tissues are fibrotic. These associations suggest a possible role for CTGF in promoting development of fibrotic lesions in phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.",6,E

The relevant data for our study was collected using cards, designed for chronically-ill patients.; A total of 1019 male and 1395 female (62.9%) out of 3838 of the study population were on monotherapy, whereas 596 male and 828 female (37.1%) were on antihypertensive combination therapy. Among the monotherapy category, the various antihypertensive drugs used were as follows: beta-blockers (58.8%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (14.2%), calcium channel blockers (11.1%), diuretics (8.1%) and alpha-methyldopa (7.0%). With respect to overall utilization pattern, beta-blockers were the most frequently prescribed (65.5%), diuretics ranked second (27.4%), followed by ACE inhibitors (20.6%), calcium channel blockers (19.9%) and alpha-methyldopa (8.5%). Within each class of antihypertensives used, the most frequently used individual agents were as follows: (a) among beta-blockers 97.7% used atenolol; (b) among the diuretics, indapamide (35.4%), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (32.7%), HCTZ in combination with triamterene (25.7%), and chlorthalidone (4.6%); (c) among the ACE inhibitors, captopril (44.9%), enalapril (29.7%), and lisinopril (19.0%); (d) among the calcium channel blockers, nifedipine (98.2%). Significant age- and gender-related differences in prescribing patterns were seen. Short-acting nifedipine monotherapy was inappropriately prescribed in a significant number of patients above the age of 50 years. ACE inhibitors accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total antihypertensive drug expenditure, although these drugs represent only one-fifth of overall antihypertensives used. There is a trend towards excessive use of expensive thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide which seems to be unjustifiable practice, particularly in a study population free from diabetic hypertensive patients.; The general pattern of antihypertensive utilization appears to be in accordance with the guidelines of WHO and the Joint National Committee issued in the 1990s. The trends of prescribing of antihypertensives were in favour of conventional ones such as the beta blockers and diuretics, and the introduction of newer classes of antihypertensives had a generally minimal impact on the prescribing profile. Almost two-thirds of the patients were treated with monotherapy. A disproportionately large percentage of antihypertensive drug cost was due to overt use of ACE inhibitors, and indapamide, instead of thiazide diuretics. The use of short-acting calcium channel blockers especially in the elderly is unjustifiable.",6,E

Both drugs were similarly effective in lowering blood pressure and goal blood pressure was achieved in 72.4% patients treated with amlodipine and 67.4% with enalapril. Also, degree of reduction of blood pressure was similar in both groups. Compared to initial values: systolic/diastolic blood pressure decreased by 23.5/14.9 mm Hg in amlodipine group and 23.2/14.0 mm Hg in subjects receiving enalapril. However, adverse effects, especially dry cough were more frequent in enalapril-treated patients. Both amlodipine and enalapril provide significant blood pressure reduction in stage I-II hypertension.

Three German regionalized Departments of Clinical Pharmacology--Jena, Dresden, Rostock--serve as Pharmacovigilance Centers in collaboration with the Pharmacoepidemiology Research Group of the University of Munich. Since January 1997, the regional group in Jena has been monitoring the University Clinic of Internal Medicine for admissions caused by adverse drug reactions. All emergency cases and patients on intensive care units were checked for adverse drug reactions. We present our results, including clinical and demographic data, concerning intoxications and especially those involving digitoxin in 210 patients with ADR. Forty patients with digitoxin toxicity had an average age of 81 years (81.1+/-6.3), a low body weight (59.7+/-12.7 kg) and 3 out of 4 were women. 75% of all patients with digitoxin side effects had elevated serum digitoxin levels with concentrations higher than 25 microg/ml. The relatively high frequency of digitoxin intoxications in our hospital may reflect the advanced age and low body weight of patients. Patients received digitoxin regardless of age, weight and, sometimes, clinical indication. Physicians should be aware of drugs having a high risk when used in elderly patients. The use of digitoxin assays and keeping serum levels within or near the therapeutic range will diminish the incidence of overdoses.",3,E

We have also looked at the frequency of cancer in these patients.; We randomly assigned 6614 elderly patients with hypertension (mean age 76 years, median time of follow-up 5.3 years) to one of three treatment strategies: conventional drugs (diuretics or b-blockers), calcium antagonists, or ACE inhibitors. We matched the patients to the Swedish Cancer Registry and compared our findings with expected values based on age, sex, and calendar-year-specific reference frequencies for the general Swedish population. We also compared the number of cancers between the three treatment groups.; At baseline, 607 (9%) patients had previous malignant disease. Diagnoses were closely similar to the distribution of cancer types that might be seen in elderly patients. During follow-up, there were 625 new cases of cancer in 590 patients. The frequency of cancer did not differ significantly between the treatment strategies, including all cancers and those at individual sites. The standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for all cancers were also close to unity: 0.92 (95% CI 0.80-1.06) for conventional drugs, 0.96 (0.83-1.10) for calcium antagonists, and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for ACE inhibitors.; No difference in cancer risk was seen between patients randomly assigned to conventional drugs, calcium antagonists, or ACE inhibitors.

The fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a secondary intraocular lens implantation. All four patients underwent a thorough assessment including history of systemic drug use. These patients had ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts), fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were followed for 1 year.; on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 (range: 20/400-20/20). Fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal lesions in all affected eyes. Early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window defect. In the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye. Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. The common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and benzodiazepines). Three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months after the phototoxicity. The fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of 20/60 12 months after the light exposure.

Though the office BPs and daytime BPs were successfully controlled to the same levels with both treatments and in both dipping groups, the antihypertensive effects were stronger with the CCB than with the ACE inhibitor in the night time and morning, especially in non-dippers. We conclude that even though office BPs were controlled successfully to almost the same levels, there is a possibility that these long-acting drugs have differential antihypertensive effects on night time and morning BPs among hypertensive patients with different night time BP dipping statuses.",5,E

Clinical examination and blinded echocardiogram readings 48 weeks after study entry in an intention-to-treat analysis of 113 enalapril-treated and 122 nifedipine-treated patients revealed similar reductions in systolic/diastolic pressure (-22/12 versus -21/13 mm Hg) and LV mass index (-15 versus -17g/m(2), both P>0.20). No significant between-treatment difference was detected in population subsets defined by monotherapy treatment, sex, age, race, or severity of baseline hypertrophy. Similarly, there was no between-treatment difference in change in velocities of early diastolic or atrial phase transmitral blood flow. More enalapril-treated than nifedipine-treated patients required supplemental treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (59% versus 34%, P<0.001) but not atenolol (27% versus 22%, NS).; Once-daily antihypertensive treatment with enalapril or long-acting nifedipine, plus adjunctive hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol when needed to control blood pressure, both had moderately beneficial and statistically indistinguishable effects on regression of LV hypertrophy.",5,E

Although the ability of obstetric care providers to identify women at risk for preterm delivery has improved, the overall incidence of preterm birth has remained unchanged for the past 30 years. Preterm birth remains the single greatest challenge for physician-researchers in the field of maternal-fetal medicine in the 21st century. This article reviews in detail the current state of the literature as regards the etiology, pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of premature labor and preterm birth. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the process of labor, both at term and preterm, will improve our ability to identify and manage women at risk of premature delivery.",4,E
11562301,A prevention strategy for circumventing drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy.,"Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; Neoplasms","Frenkel, G D; Caffrey, P B","The development of drug resistance is considered to be a major cause for the failure of chemotherapy in a number of types of cancer, including ovarian, breast and lung. Most previous research has focused on approaches to reverse drug resistance once it has arisen, that is, on the use of agents which can make drug-resistant tumors more sensitive to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, this approach has thus far met with only limited clinical success. Because of the prevalence of drug resistance in cases of advanced cancer, there exists an urgent need to develop new approaches to dealing with this problem. We have hypothesized the feasibility of an alternative approach: the use of specific agents to prevent the development of resistance before it arises. Our initial studies to examine this hypothesis have focused on ovarian cancer. We have designed both in vitro and in vivo systems in which resistance develops rapidly after exposure of tumor cells or xenografts to melphalan or cisplatin. Using these systems we have shown that two selenium compounds, selenite and selenomethionine are able to prevent the induction of resistance. Furthermore, inclusion of selenite in a chemotherapeutic protocol can result in a significant enhancement of the efficacy of cisplatin in suppressing the growth of human ovarian tumor xenografts. These results have supported the idea that prevention may be a useful new approach to the problem of drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy.",5,E

The target blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg or less in all groups. We compared the groups with regard to the time to the primary composite end point of a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration, the development of end-stage renal disease, or death from any cause. We also compared them with regard to the time to a secondary, cardiovascular composite end point.; The mean duration of follow-up was 2.6 years.

This paper describes a HOT substudy in which patients underwent both office measurement and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.; The mean age of the substudy population was 62 +/- 7 years. Substudy patients were treated for a median period of 2 years. All received the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist felodipine, while some also received an ACE-inhibitor, a beta-blocker or a diuretic.

Additional analyses included computation of: (1) trough-to-peak ratio and (2) the smoothness index (the ratio between the average of the 24 hourly blood pressure reductions after treatment and its standard deviation).; Taking the subgroup as a whole, baseline 24 h average blood pressures (146 +/- 18/90 +/- 10 mmHg) were significantly and markedly lower than office blood pressures (170 +/- 14/105 +/- 3 mmHg, P < 0.01). Office, 24 h, day and night blood pressures were all significantly reduced by treatment, but there was a smaller fall in ambulatory, than in office pressures. The between group differences in office blood pressure were smaller than those observed in the overall HOT sample. Between-group differences in 24 h blood pressure were even smaller. Trough-to-peak ratios and smoothness indices were lowest in the highest blood pressure target group and highest in the lowest blood pressure target group.

A total of 241 patients were included in the study. All of them were hypertensive and had a 25% or at least 0.5 mg/dl increase in the value of serum creatinine during the 24 months prior to entering the study. Initial doses of fosinopril and nifedipine GITS were 10 and 30 mg respectively, and titration to 30 and 60 mg was performed if needed to obtain the expected blood pressure goal (< 140/90 mmHg). Furosemide, atenolol, and doxazosin were added as second, third, and fourth drugs if necessary, for blood pressure control. The primary end-point of the study was the appearance of double the serum creatinine values and/or the need to enter a dialysis programme. Secondary end-points were cardiovascular events, death, changes in 24 h proteinuria, and the evolution of serum creatinine. Data reflect the analysis performed by intention to treat.; Mean age of the group was 54 +/- 14, and 59% were males. Primary glomerulonephritis (31%), nephrosclerosis (26%) and polycystic kidney disease (19%) were the three most frequent diagnostic findings. After 3 years of follow-up, 21% (27/127) of patients treated with fosinopril, and 36% (40/112) of those receiving nifedipine GITS presented a primary end-point, (OR 0.47, 95% confidence intervals 0.26-0.84, P = 0.01). Renal survival was significantly better when fosinopril constituted the first step therapy (P = 0.002). These results did not seem to be influenced by the type of primary renal disease. Proteinuria decreased at the end of the study by a mean of 57% in the fosinopril group and increased by 7% in the group receiving dihydropiridine. Blood pressure control did not differ among groups for diastolic values. During follow-up, however, the patients receiving ACEi showed systolic blood pressure values 4-6 mmHg lower.; In patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension due to primary renal disease, fosinopril significantly differed from nifedipine GITS by its capacity to slow the progressive decay in renal function. The drugs also differed by their capacity to lower blood pressure. The better control, in particular of systolic blood pressure, in the fosinopril arm could have contributed in a relevant manner to the attainment of a better outcome when the ACEi was employed.",I,I

In the absence of contraindications, beta-blockers are recommended as initial therapy. All beta-blockers seem to be equally effective. If the patient has serious contraindications to beta-blockers, unacceptable side effects, or persistent angina, calcium antagonists should be administered. Long-acting dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine agents are generally as effective as beta-blockers in relieving angina. Long-acting nitrates are considered third-line therapy because a nitrate-free interval is required to avoid developing tolerance. All long-acting nitrates seem to be equally effective. Patients with angina should take 75 to 325 mg of aspirin daily unless they have contraindications. Such risk factors as smoking, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, diabetes, and hypertension should be treated appropriately. Coronary revascularization has not been shown to improve survival for most patients with chronic angina but may be required to control symptoms. However, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is often indicated for symptomatic patients with left-main disease, three-vessel disease, or two-vessel disease including proximal stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery; it improves their survival. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is an alternative to CABG for patients with normal left ventricular function and favorable angiographic features. Coronary artery bypass grafting is initially more effective in relieving angina than medical therapy, but the two procedures yield similar results after 5 to 10 years. Eighty percent of patients who undergo CABG remain angina-free 5 years after surgery. In low-risk patients, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty seems to control angina better than medical therapy, but recurrent angina and repeated procedures are more likely than with CABG. Patient education is an important component of management. Long-term follow-up should be individualized to ascertain clinical stability at regular intervals and to reassess prognosis when warranted.",8,8

Specifically, it has been proposed that the diabetic state may alter the pharmacokinetics of several cardiovascular drugs, including some calcium antagonists. The present study investigates the effects of diabetes mellitus on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amlodipine in hypertensive subjects with and without diabetes mellitus to determine whether the diabetic state alters these parameters. This trial consisted of a 2-week placebo washout phase, a 2-week titration phase, and a 2-week maintenance phase. Study patients included 18 hypertensive patients with type II diabetes mellitus and 10 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. Blood samples were collected after administration of amlodipine and AUC, Cmax, and tmax were determined. The acute 24-hour pharmacodynamic response to amlodipine was assessed by blood pressure and telemetric heart rate measurements. There were no significant differences for either amlodipine 5 or 10 mg in AUC (p = 0.40 for 5 mg; p = 0.59 for 10 mg), Cmax (p = 0.41 for 5 mg; p = 0.45 for 10 mg), and tmax (p = 0.79 for 5 mg; p = 0.67 for 10 mg) between diabetic and nondiabetic hypertensive subjects. Similarly, the 24-hour pharmacodynamic effects of amlodipine on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate did not differ between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects as assessed by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Because of the theoretical basis for anticipating that diabetes mellitus may provoke important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations, our study provides an important database in clearly demonstrating that the diabetic milieu did not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of amlodipine.",6,E

Although some degree of risk for adverse effects with drugs promising a strong therapeutic effect can be accepted, caution needs to be exercised when benefits are marginal or unproven. Unfortunately, some of the tocolytics, most notably the betamimetics and magnesium sulfate, have been found to have considerable potential for adverse maternal cardiovascular and respiratory effects. Although less clearly established, the use of indomethacin appears to be associated with increased fetal and neonatal risks. Concerning magnesium sulfate, in addition to the well-known maternal effects, the accumulating evidence showing an increased frequency of adverse outcomes in the fetus and neonate has led to the recommendations to abandon its use entirely as a tocolytic. Given the limitations of our current state of knowledge, nifedipine would appear to be among the more efficacious and safer tocolytics available to use when properly indicated.",4,E

All underwent serial echocardiograms upon admission, 4 days post-admission during low-dose dobutamine stress echo, at discharge and after 6 months. We calculated the dysfunction score (1 = hypokinesia, 2 = akinesia, 3 = dyskinesia) on admission and its percent reduction after dobutamine (viability) and at follow-up (recovery). The 12-lead electrocardiograms were continuously monitored for 3 days and coronary angioplasty was performed whenever the residual stenosis was > 60%.; Upon admission, there were no differences in age, sex, infarct location and size, degree of ST-segment elevation, time from onset of symptoms and dysfunction score. Creatine kinase peaked early in 70% of patients in both groups; the incidences of recurrent ischemia, infarct-related vessel patency and the need for coronary angioplasty were also similar. The creatine kinase peak was significantly higher in group 2 (2931 +/- 2456 vs 1726 +/- 1004 IU/l, p < 0.05). Conversely, in group 1 the residual viability was significantly higher (51 +/- 23 vs 36 +/- 30% improvement in dysfunction score, p < 0.05) and the early recovery of regional function was significantly greater (35 +/- 34 vs 18 +/- 22% at discharge, p < 0.05). On the other hand, the delayed recovery was not significantly different (15 +/- 29 vs 21 +/- 32% from the time of discharge to 6 months of follow-up).; Intravenous diltiazem, started before coronary reperfusion, has beneficial effects on the infarct size, residual viability and recovery of regional function. If confirmed by larger trials, these preliminary results suggest the use of diltiazem as adjunctive therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction and undergoing reperfusion.",4,E

A total of 145 patients with a diastolic blood pressure (BP) between 95 and 110 mm Hg received 8 weeks of verapamil sustained release (240 mg) and amlodipine (5 mg) in a prospective randomized, double blind, cross-over study, both after 4 weeks of placebo. The 24-h autonomic balance was measured by analysis of 24-h heart rate variability and short-term autonomic control of BP by baroreflex sensitivity measurements. Plasma norepinephrine was sampled at rest. Blood pressure was equally reduced from 153/100 mm Hg to 139/91 mm Hg with verapamil and 138/91 mm Hg with amlodipine, P = .50/.59. The low- to high-frequency ratio (LF/HF), reflecting sympathovagal balance, was higher with amlodipine than with verapamil (4.66 v 4.10; P = .001). Baroreflex function was improved by both treatments; however, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was significantly higher with verapamil than with amlodipine (8.47 v 8.06 msec/mm Hg; P = .01). Plasma norepinephrine (NE) level was higher with amlodipine than with verapamil (1.59 v 1.32 nmol/L; P < .0001). Amlodipine induces a shift in sympathovagal balance, as measured by heart rate variability indices and plasma NE, toward sympathetic predominance compared with vagal predominance with verapamil. Short-term autonomic control of BP, as assessed by BRS, is more effectively improved by verapamil than by amlodipine. These contrasting effects on autonomic function suggest that the nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist verapamil may have additional beneficial effects beyond lowering BP compared with the dihydropyridine amlodipine.",5,E

The purpose of this study was to investigate if the response rate to treatment differs with these drugs in this setting. A single centre, prospective, randomised, double-blinded, comparative study to address the efficacy of controlled release nifedipine or lisinopril in the treatment of hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or =95 mmHg) in cyclosporin (CsA)-treated renal transplant recipients was performed. Recipients were randomised to receive either lisinopril (10 mg once daily) or controlled release nifedipine (30 mg once daily). The dose was doubled on indication. The number of responders (diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg on monotherapy) were addressed during the early post-transplant phase (first 3 months) and during a late post-transplant phase (from 3 to 12 months after renal transplantation) in the same patient population. One hundred and fifty-four patients (nifedipine=78, lisinopril=76) with untreated hypertension (diastolic blood pressure> or =95 mmHg) were randomised within 3 wk after renal transplantation. One hundred and twenty-three patients (nifedipine=69, lisinopril=54) completed the study. Fourteen (20%) nifedipine-treated recipients responded during the early, and 26 (38%) during the late post-operative phase (months 4-12 after renal transplantation). Eleven (20%) lisinopril-treated recipients responded during the early, and 18 (33%) during the late post-transplant phase. Non-responders were, on average, 8.5+/-1.5 kg heavier both in the early phase and after 1 yr of treatment (p<0.01), and 6.1+/-0.9 yr older than responders (p<0.05). In conclusion, these results indicate that both controlled release nifedipine and lisinopril are equally efficient in the treatment of post-transplant hypertension. As monotherapy, both drugs show a ""response rate"" of 20-38%, depending on time interval after transplantation.",4,E

Postoperative atrial fibrillation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and longer, more expensive hospital stays. Prophylactic use of beta-adrenergic blockers reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation and should be administered before and after cardiac surgery to all patients without contraindication. Prophylactic amiodarone and atrial overdrive pacing should be considered in patients at high risk for postoperative atrial fibrillation (for example, patients with previous atrial fibrillation or mitral valve surgery). For patients who develop atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, a strategy of rhythm management or rate management should be selected. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable or highly symptomatic or who have a contraindication to anticoagulation, rhythm management with electrical cardioversion, amiodarone, or both is preferred. Treatment of the remaining patients should focus on rate control because most will spontaneously revert to sinus rhythm within 6 weeks after discharge. All patients with atrial fibrillation persisting for more than 24 to 48 hours and without contraindication should receive anticoagulation.; Atrial fibrillation frequently complicates cardiac surgery. Many cases can be prevented with appropriate prophylactic therapy. A strategy of rhythm management for symptomatic patients and rate management for all other patients usually results in reversion to sinus rhythm within 6 weeks of discharge.",I,6

Sotalol, amiodarone, and dofetilide have been evaluated for their ability to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. All of these agents are moderately effective; however, amiodarone appears to be most efficacious. Aside from their common class III actions, these agents have profoundly different pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, safety, and drug interaction profiles that help guide drug selection. Amiodarone and dofetilide are safe in patients who have had a myocardial infarction and those with heart failure. The safety of commercially available d,l-sotalol in these patients is poorly understood. Torsades de pointes is the most serious adverse effect of sotalol and dofetilide, and risk increases with renal dysfunction. Amiodarone has minimal proarrhythmic risk but has numerous noncardiac toxicities that require frequent monitoring. Overall, an ideal antiarrhythmic agent does not exist, and drug selection should be highly individualized.",6,E

This was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, parallel, controlled trial carried out in 11 Spanish hospitals. A total of 103 type 2 diabetic patients with stable albuminuria and BP not controlled on monotherapy were randomised of which 93 finished the study. After a 4-week single-blind placebo period, patients were randomised to verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg (VT) or to enalapril/hydroclorothiazide 20/12.5 mg (EH). Treatment duration was 6 months. The main outcome measures were changes in BP, 24-h albuminuria, blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin. Overall BP was significantly reduced from 157.3 +/- 12.0/98.3 +/- 6.4 mm Hg to 140.5 +/- 14.5/86.1 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and albuminuria significantly decreased from 508.6 +/- 693.8 mg/24 h to 253.4 +/- 517.2 mg/24 h (P < 0.001), both without significant differences between treatments. Glycated haemoglobin was not modified on VT: baseline, 5.91 +/- 1.43%; end of treatment, 5.94 +/- 1.62%, but increased on EH: baseline, 5.96 +/- 1.25%; final, 6.41 +/- 1.51%, (ANOVA interaction P = 0.040).

There were no changes in body weight, serum creatinine, uric acid, potassium, cholesterol, tryglicerides and serum albumin. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients not controlled on monotherapy, both treatments similarly reduced albuminuria.

Previous meta-analyses conflict and suggest that CCBs increase myocardial infarction (MI) or protect from stroke.; Standard procedures for meta-analysis were used to analyze three major trials on 21,611 patients and another three lesser studies to a total of 24,322 patients.; Calcium channel blockers have a strikingly similar risk of total and cardiovascular mortality and of major cardiovascular events to conventional therapy. Calcium channel blockers give a lower risk of nonfatal stroke (-25%, p = 0.001) and a higher risk of total MI (18%, p = 0.013), chiefly nonfatal (18%). After performing the Bonferroni correction for multiplicity, these p values become 0.004 and 0.052, respectively. When compared with ACE inhibitors in 1,318 diabetic patients, CCBs had a substantially higher risk of nonfatal (relative risk [RR] = 2.259) and total MI (RR = 2.204, confidence interval 1.501 to 3.238; p = 0.001 or 0.004 with Bonferroni correction). Total and cardiovascular mortality rates are similar. To confirm the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors are superior to CCBs in diabetic patients requires more trial data, especially with renal end points.; Mortality (total and cardiovascular) and major cardiovascular events with CCBs were apparently similar to those events seen with conventional first-line therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers). Stroke reduction more than balanced increased MI. In diabetics, CCBs may be less safe than ACE inhibitors.",I,I

Although, traditionally, this hypertension is thought to be largely volume-dependent, an increasing body of literature suggests that there is an important sympathetic neural component. Microneurographic studies have demonstrated sympathetic overactivity without baroreflex impairment in both hypertensive chronic hemodialysis patients as well as in those with less advanced renal insufficiency. Sympathetic nerve activity was found to be normal in hemodialysis patients with bilateral nephrectomy, leading to the hypothesis that sympathetic overactivity in uremia is caused by a neurogenic signal (carried by renal afferents) arising in the failing kidney. This hypothesis is supported by rat studies showing that renal deafferentation abrogates hypertension in the 5/6 nephrectomy model of chronic renal insufficiency. In addition, in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and renin-dependent hypertension, sympathetic overactivity was normalized by chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition but not by calcium channel blockade, implicating a major central neural action of angiotensin II.; Sympathetic overactivity in chronic renal failure is caused by neurohormonal mechanisms arising in the failing kidney. Future clinical studies are needed to determine whether normalization of sympathetic activity should constitute an important therapeutic goal in this high-risk patient population.",5,E

Both combined therapies lowered blood pressure to similar levels. A combination therapy with losartan and quinapril significantly increased the H/M ratio (1.93 +/- 0.29 and 2.02 +/- 0.29, P < 0.01) and decreased the washout rate (17.6 +/- 11.0 and 15.3 +/- 9.2%, P < 0.02) without affecting AII concentration, whereas a combination therapy with amlodipine and quinapril therapy did not affect the scintigraphic parameters with an increase in the AII concentration.; With a usual antihypertensive dose, both losartan and quinapril had a little suppressive effect on the cardiac sympathetic activity in essential hypertension. In contrast, the combination therapy with losartan and quinapril, which results in a higher degree of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, could suppress the cardiac sympathetic activity effectively.",2,E

We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who received nifedipine. We recorded the dose administered, all BP measurements and all adverse events reported within six hours of a nifedipine dose regardless of the likelihood that those events were related to the nifedipine dose. 1,746 doses of nifedipine in 166 pediatric patients were reviewed. Systolic BP decreased by a mean of 17% and a maximum of 63%. Diastolic BP decreased by a mean of 28% and a maximum of 89%. Adverse events included: a) change in neurologic status, six cases; b) hypotension, two cases; c) oxygen desaturation, 16 cases. Neurologic events occurred in 33% of patients with acute CNS injury and 3.6% of all patients. Short-acting nifedipine is an important and effective oral antihypertensive agent which can be safely used for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies in children.

Although not widely recognized by clinicians, this risk factor is easily assessed by measures such as resting and peak exercise heart rate, heart rate recovery after exercise, and heart rate variability. Any factor that leads to inappropriate activation of the sympathetic nervous system can be expected to have an adverse effect on these measures and thus on patient outcomes, while any factor that augments vagal tone tends to improve outcomes. Insulin resistance, sympathomimetic medications, and negative psychosocial factors all have the potential to affect autonomic function adversely and thus cardiovascular prognosis. Congestive heart failure and hypertension also provide important lessons about the adverse effects of sympathetic predominance, as well as illustrate the benefits of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 2 classes of drugs that reduce adrenergic tone. Other interventions, such as exercise, improve cardiovascular outcomes partially by increasing vagal activity and attenuating sympathetic hyperactivity.",5,E

11817974,Treatment of heart failure in patients with diabetes mellitus.,Animals; Cardiomyopathies; Diabetes Complications; Heart Failure; Humans,"Lavine, Steven J; Gellman, Steven D","Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Both coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure (CHF) are largely responsible for the increased cardiovascular adverse events in patients with diabetes. This review discusses the pathophysiology of CHF, the mechanisms of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and the neurohormonal mechanisms involved in both LV dysfunction and CHF. Diabetes with and without hypertension is an important cause of LV dysfunction and CHF. Diabetes may be responsible for the metabolic and ultrastructural causes of LV dysfunction, while hypertension may be responsible for the marked fibrotic changes that are found. Experimental induction of diabetes in animals has shed light on the biochemical and ultrastructural changes seen. The role of insulin to reverse both metabolic and structural changes is reviewed both from experimental data and with the limited amount of clinical data available. The therapy of CHF in patients with diabetes is similar to that of patients without diabetes, with therapy directed toward the use of beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. As the morbidity and mortality are higher in patients with diabetes, several studies have pointed out the importance of this subgroup where the opportunity to make a significant clinical impact exists. A significant opportunity exists to reduce morbidity and mortality with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors when ischaemia and CHF are both present. However, studies in patients diabetes have been limited to post hoc subgroup analyses and rarely as predefined subgroups. Clinical trials involving patients with diabetes with and without hypertension and LV dysfunction are clearly needed in the future to adequately address the needs of this high risk subgroup.",5,E

Blood pressure, renal resistive index (by US Doppler) and UAE (mean of three nonconsecutive timed urinary collections, microg/min) were evaluated at baseline and over the course of 24 months of treatment.; Both regimens effectively lowered blood pressure (mean blood pressure from 123 +/- 1.8 at baseline to 103 +/- 1.5 mm Hg at 24 months in the lisinopril group and from 122 +/- 1.9 at baseline to 104 +/- 0.8 at 24 months in the nifedipine group, p < 0.001 for both groups). Overall, blood pressure decrease was associated with a reduction in UAE and no change in RI throughout the study. However, despite similar blood pressure reduction, the two regimens showed different specific effects. Lisinopril was associated with a significant decrease in both UAE (33.8 +/- 16.2 at baseline and 9.1 +/- 2.1 at 24 months, p < 0.01) and renal RI (0.61 +/- 0.02 at baseline and 0.56 +/- 0.04 at 24 months, p < 0.05) while nifedipine GITS did not significantly influence UAE (35.7 +/- 12.2 at baseline and 31.2 +/- 12.1 at 24 months, n.s.) or RI (0.61 +/- 0.01 at baseline and 0.59 +/- 0.02 at 24 months, n.s.).; Effective blood pressure control over a long period of time reduces the severity of organ damage, namely UAE while maintaining renovascular resistance in patients with essential hypertension. Different classes of antihypertensive agents might convey additional specific renal protection beyond blood pressure control. These data could be useful in devising individualized therapeutic strategies in hypertensive patients at increased renal risk.",8,E

During weeks 8, 10 and 12 of each treatment period, compliance failures were simulated by patients missing 0, 1 or 2 doses of their medication, and ambulatory systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure measurements were obtained.; Following steady-state treatment (i.e. 'perfect compliance'), there was no difference between amlodipine and nifedipine GITS in SBP (140.1 versus 134.2 mmHg) or DBP (84.0 versus 85.8 mmHg) at 0-24 h post-dose. When compliance was not perfect, i.e. when one or two doses were missed, DBP was maintained at a significantly lower level with amlodipine compared with nifedipine GITS at 24-48 h post-dose (83.1 versus 86.4 mmHg, P = 0.005) and at 48-72 h post-dose (84.2 versus 89.7 mmHg, P < 0.001).

After a 4-week placebo run-in phase, 150 patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to treatment with 5 mg of amlodipine (n = 48), 15 mg of chlorthalidone (n = 50), or placebo (n = 52). Patients who failed to meet the systolic blood pressure (BP) reduction goal by week 4 had their dose increased to 10 mg of amlodipine or 30 mg of chlorthalidone, and maintained at this increased dose for 12 weeks. Results showed a mean reduction (mean +/- SD) in sitting systolic BP from baseline to the last treatment visit of -14.6+/-12.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI] -18.2, -11.0), -14.0+/-13.46 mm Hg (95% CI -17.8, -10.2), and -3.4+/-11.83 mm Hg (95% CI -6.7, -0.1) for the amlodipine, chlorthalidone, and the placebo treatment groups, respectively. Both active treatments showed significantly greater reductions than the placebo group (P < or = .001), but were not significantly different from each other. Sixty-seven percent of the amlodipine, 69% of the chlorthalidone, and 25% of the placebo-treated patients reached the protocol defined systolic BP goal (P = .001). Both active treatment groups showed a trend of better systolic BP response in older patients (> or =65 years). Secondary efficacy measures including pulse pressure, standing systolic, diastolic, and the 24-h ambulatory BP were also statistically significantly improved for both active treatments at the end of treatment, except for chlorthalidone in standing diastolic BP. Adverse events that occurred during the study were as expected and were well tolerated.

After a 2-week placebo wash-out period, the patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either valsartan 80 mg once daily (o.d.) or amlodipine 5 mg o.d. for 4 weeks; in the case of an unsatisfactory blood pressure response, the treatments could be respectively changed to the fixed combination of valsartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg o.d. or amlodipine 10 mg o.d. for a further 8 weeks. The trough:peak ratio (global and individualized approaches) and smoothness index (i.e., the ratio between the average of the 24-hourly BP changes after treatment and the corresponding standard deviation) were calculated from 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recordings made after the placebo period and after 4 weeks and 12 weeks of active treatment.; Both regimens effectively lowered systolic and diastolic ambulatory pressures after 4 weeks and 12 weeks (all P<0.001) but, among the responders, the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination had a greater antihypertensive effect during the night-time hours after 12 weeks (P=0.03/0.02). In the responders, the placebo-adjusted, mean trough:peak ratios were 0.76/0.74 in the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide group (n = 111) and 0.66/0.62 in the amlodipine group (n = 101). The corresponding global trough:peak ratios were 0.61/0.57 for the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination and 0.56/0.56 for amlodipine. However, the between-group differences in individual or global trough:peak ratios were not significant. The smoothness index was slightly, but insignificantly, greater for valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide than for amlodipine in the responders and the groups as a whole.; Valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine were equally effective in reducing ambulatory BP, but the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination led to more homogeneous BP control during the inter-dosing interval. Trough:peak ratio and smoothness index did not reflect this finding accurately.",2,E

However, since office blood pressure measurements reflect to a limited extent blood pressure outside the office, a side-arm INSIGHT study in which patients underwent both office measurement and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was also performed.; The study had a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design. After 4 weeks of placebo, mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients were randomized to nifedipine GITS 30 mg or amiloride 2.5 + hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg for 3.1 years. Dose titration was performed by dose doubling and addition of atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg, or other drugs when needed. Analysis was carried out by intention-to-treat and included computation of 24 h, day and night ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate values. Additional analyses included computation of the trough-to-peak ratio and the smoothness index (the ratio between the average of the 24-hourly blood pressure reductions after treatment and its standard deviation).; A total of 151 patients were recruited and 149 were valid for analysis: 78 patients had 24 h ambulatory recordings both at baseline and during treatment and 134 during treatment. Office, 24 h and day and night blood pressures were all significantly and similarly reduced by both treatments. Office and ambulatory heart rate was left unchanged by diuretics, while it was slightly reduced by nifedipine. Median trough-to-peak ratios were always > 0.5 and superimposable between the two treatment groups. Similarly, smoothness indices of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were comparably high for nifedipine and diuretics, thus demonstrating a similar well-balanced antihypertensive response to both drugs. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups in the number of cardiovascular events (17 in the nifedipine-based and 26 in the diuretics-based treatment group).; In the INSIGHT study, the long-term antihypertensive effect on 24 h blood pressure and the cardiovascular protection of nifedipine was similar to that of diuretics.",I,E

Scales contributing to physical health and a summary measure, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (mean, 43.4 +/- 10.9 [SD]), were significantly lower than scales relating to mental health and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) score (51.3 +/- 10.3). All scales (except Role-Physical) and the PCS and MCS were significantly higher in men (44.3 +/- 10.9 and 51.8 +/- 10.0, respectively) than women (41.9 +/- 10.8 and 50.5 +/- 10.6, respectively). In multivariate analysis, employment status, education level, household income, body mass index, comorbid medical conditions, years of hypertension, number of antihypertensive drugs prescribed, exercise status, and male sex were significant independent predictors of PCS. Fewer factors predicted MCS and included employment status, marital status, current smoking, age, comorbid medical conditions, and male sex. In the entire AASK cohort, mean scores for individual scales, except Mental Health, and the PCS were lower, but the mean MCS score was slightly higher than values for the US general population. Values for individual scales of the SF-36 and the PCS were substantially higher among AASK participants compared with African-American hemodialysis patients. Six of the eight scales were lower in the AASK cohort compared with groups of racially mixed and exclusively African-American hypertensive subjects. We conclude that physical aspects of quality of life are substantially reduced compared with mental components among AASK participants, and a number of demographic and clinical characteristics significantly impact on HRQL.",I,6

A total of one hundred and thirty three patients were screened out of which one hundred and twenty-one patients were enrolled in a 9-week multicentre open, randomised rising-dose trial to receive either Felodipine 5-10 mg once daily or Nifedipine 10-20 mg twice daily. Blood pressure was measured at the end of the dosing interval that is 24 hours and 12 hours after Felodipine and Nifedipine respectively. Both drugs, Felodipine and Nifedipine were found to lower blood pressure significantly compared with baseline. After three weeks of treatment, seated blood pressure was reduced by 20/14 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) and by 24/16 mmHg after 6 weeks in the felodipine group. Corresponding values in the Nifedipine group were 16/09 mmHg and 24/13mmHg. Pulse rate was not significantly affected by either drugs. The percentage of patients who had satisfactory control after 3 weeks treatment was 57.6% for Felodipine and 33.3% for Nifedipine (significant). After dose titration (where necessary), at the end of the study the response rates were 76.3% (n=45) and 79.6% (n=43) for Felodipine and Nifedipine respectively (non significant). Both drugs were metabolically inert and did not derange the haematologic and biochemical profile of patients. They produced no significant weight changes. The pattern of side effects were similar in both groups but tended to be more severe with Nifedipine necessitating withdrawal of two patients in this group. In conclusion, Felodipine ER 5mg - 10mg once daily, and Nifedipine Retard, 20mg twice daily were equally effective medications for mild-to-moderate hypertension but Felodipine was better tolerated.",5,E

Normo-albuminuric essential hypertensives, <50 years old, who had not been previously treated with antihypertensive drugs and who did not have diabetes mellitus were included. After the initial evaluation, patients were treated using only nonpharmacological measures (n=62), beta-blockers (n=38), ACE inhibitors (n=64), calcium channel blockers (n=8), and several classes (n=15). Measurements were taken for office blood pressure, biochemical profile, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion at the beginning of the study and were measured yearly during an average of 2.7+/-1.2 years of follow-up. Among the 187 patients included, 22 (11,7%) developed microalbuminuria (progressors, 4.4/100 patients/y). No differences were present between progressors and those who remained normo-albuminuric (nonprogressors) in terms of age, gender, body mass index, disease duration, blood pressure values, biochemical profile, familial history of diabetes or hypertension, smoking habits, or the presence of EKG left ventricular hypertrophy. The group with the lowest progression rate was the patients treated with ACE inhibitors (n=5; 2.9/100 patients/y), followed by the diet group (n=5; 3.3/100 patients/y) and the beta-blockers group (n=5; 4.1/100 patients/y). When we excluded patients treated with calcium channel blockers or those who changed over time between different classes of treatment, no significant differences in the incidence of microalbuminuria were observed among the groups. Progressors showed higher slopes of fasting glucose (4.78+/-11.4 versus 0.50+/-6.8 mg/y, P<0.02) and uric acid (0.58+/-0.93 versus 0.05+/-1.10 mg/y, P<0.03) compared with the slopes of nonprogressors. Both the slopes for glucose and systolic blood pressure over time were associated independently with the slope of the logarithm of urinary albumin excretion when adjusted for age, gender, and treatment groups. Cox proportional hazard model for progression of microalbuminuria showed that baseline urinary albumin excretion (risk ratio [RR]=1.06; confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.01 to 1.11), slope for systolic blood pressure (RR=1.11; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.20), and slope for glucose (RR=1.08; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.14) were independently associated to the development of microalbuminuria. In conclusion, in a group of young adults with essential hypertension that had not been previously treated, the main factors influencing the occurrence of microalbuminuria during antihypertensive treatment were the values of microalbuminuria at baseline and the slopes for systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose.",2,E

We hypothesized that systematic rotation through the major classes of antihypertensive drugs would demonstrate substantial differences in the pattern of an individual patient's response, and suggest a more rational approach to choosing best treatment.; Thirty-four young hypertensives (age 28-55, median 47) rotated in a double-blind, Latin-square, crossover fashion through 6 weeks of treatment each with amlodipine, doxazosin, lisinopril, bisoprolol, bendrofluazide and placebo. Blood pressure was measured at each visit. 'Best' drug, defined by efficacy and tolerability, was repeated at the end.; Rotation doubled the number of patients reaching target blood pressure (systolic < 140 mmHg) on one drug (P = 0.03). All five drugs were represented among the 'best' drugs. In six patients, the blood pressure on 'best' drug was at least 10 mmHg lower than on any other. Response to the 'best' drug was highly correlated (r = 0.79) with its previous administration. By contrast, there were only weak correlations between responses to pairs of drugs, except for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (A) with beta-blocker (B), and calcium blocker (C) with diuretic (D) - each r = 0.71, P < 0.005). In these young patients, the majority of patients (23/34) responded best to a drug suppressing the renin system (A and B).; Patients vary reproducibly in their response to initial treatment, and switching among drugs can increase the efficacy of monotherapy. The results support an AB/CD scheme for choosing therapy, in which the first drug is taken from one of these pairs, and uncontrolled patients switch to one of the other pair.",2,E

We sought to determine if patients taking calcium channel blockers (CCBs) at the time of admission with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) had a higher case-fatality compared with those taking beta-blockers or neither medication. Clinical and drug treatment variables at the time of hospital admission predictive of survival at 28 days were examined in a community-based registry of patients aged under 65 years admitted to hospital for suspected AMI in Perth, Australia, between 1984 and 1993. Among 7766 patients, 1291 (16.6%) were taking a CCB and 1259 (16.2%) a betablocker alone at hospital admission. Patients taking CCBs had a worse clinical profile than those taking a beta-blocker alone or neither drug (control group), and a higher unadjusted 28-day mortality (17.6% versus 9.3% and 11.1% respectively, both P < 0.001). There was no significant heterogeneity with respect to mortality between nifedipine, diltiazem, or verapamil when used alone, or with a beta-blocker. After adjustment for factors predictive of death at 28 days, patients taking a CCB were found not to have an excess chance of death compared with the control group (odds ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.87, 1.30), whereas those taking a beta-blocker alone had a lower odds of death (OR 0.75, 95% CI; 0.59, 0.94). These results indicate that established calcium channel blockade is not associated with an excess risk of death following AMI once other differences between patients are taken into account, but neither does it have the survival advantage seen with prior beta-blocker therapy.",I,6

Patients received oral azimilide (100 mg in SVA-1 and SVA-3, 35 or 75 mg in SVA-2, and 125 mg in SVA-4) or matching placebo twice daily for 3 days (loading period), followed by once-daily dosing (maintenance period). The primary outcome variable was the first recording of a symptomatic supraventricular arrhythmia (either PSVT, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter) recorded on a transtelephonic electrocardiographic event recorder. The duration of study was 270 days in SVA-1 and SVA-2 and 180 days in SVA-3 and SVA-4. Combined analysis results of the PSVT stratum from the 4 studies showed a dose-response relationship in prolongation of time to recurrence (P =.02). In the combined 100-mg daily dose, the hazard ratio (placebo:azimilide) was 2.35 (P =.023). The hazard ratio for the 125-mg daily dose measured 1.28 (P = not significant). However, the time to recurrence was prolonged when the patients receiving 100 and 125 mg daily were combined and compared with placebo (P =.02).

We have sought to resolve the question of whether dipyridamole treatment increases the risk of cardiac adverse events in patients with co-existing ischaemic heart disease. The published literature, periodic safety update reports, the randomised controlled trials of antiplatelet agents in stroke prevention and those including dipyridamole in cardiovascular indications, have been reviewed and analysed. The early reports of serious adverse cardiac effect attributable to dipyridamole occurred in patients with severe coronary artery disease using dipyridamole as a stress test adjunct to cardiac imaging. The randomised controlled trials databases show no evidence of mortality and only isolated cases of significant cardiac morbidity attributable to dipyridamole at recommended oral doses in patients with ischaemic heart disease. We conclude that patients with cerebrovascular and mild to moderate concomitant ischaemic heart disease may be treated safely with dipyridamole for the secondary prevention of stroke.",3,E

Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, and the vasodilator hydralazine have both been used as antihypertensive agents in this condition. The aim of this study was to determine which of these two agents is the most appropriate antihypertensive in the management of severe pre-eclampsia.; One hundred and twenty-six pre-eclamptic patients with a gestational age of more than 20 weeks were randomized to receive either 8 mg nifedipine sublingually or 5-10 mg intravenous hydralazine. Women with a history of heart failure and women receiving antihypertensive treatment during the course of the current pregnancy were excluded. For each patient the following data were recorded; the number of drug administrations, the time needed to control blood pressure, mean urinary output, the time interval between effective control and a new hypertensive crisis after each drug administration and relevant adverse effects in mother or fetus.; Effective control of blood pressure was achieved in both treatment arms. Data analysis indicated significantly fewer drug administrations in the nifedipine arm of the study. The time interval before a new hypertensive crisis following initial effective control of blood pressure was significantly longer in the nifedipine group when compared with hydralazine. Effective control of blood pressure was achieved more rapidly in multiparous patients receiving nifedipine (p=0.026). Mean urinary output before and after delivery was greater in the nifedipine arm of the study. There were no significant differences between the two groups in other variables. In addition, in neither group were there any serious adverse effects in mother or fetus.; Nifedipine is safe and more effective than hydralazine in controlling blood pressure in severe pre-eclampsia.

However, it is not clear whether this is because of their direct effect on antagonizing the toxicity of CsA to renal tubular cells. In this study, we have used Madin-Darby canine kidney tubular cells as a model to examine the effect of diltiazem, a calcium channel antagonist, on CsA-induced apoptosis. Moreover, to investigate the possible regulation of CsA cytotoxicity by intracellular calcium level, the effect of the calcium ionophore A23187 on CsA-induced apoptosis was also examined. We found that treatment of CsA (20 microM) alone caused 20-30% cell death, which was apparently (30-40%) enhanced by diltiazem at 100 microg/ml, accompanied by more severe DNA fragmentation, activation of caspases, and a decreased level of Bcl-2. The caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk or Bcl-2 overexpression was capable of suppressing apoptosis induced by the synergistic effect of diltiazem and CsA. Moreover, the survival rate of cells treated with CsA (30 microM) alone remained only 30%, however, it was markedly (approximately 40%) elevated by co-treatment with A23187 (75 ng/ml). The rescue of cells from CsA-induced apoptosis by A23187 was correlated with AKT activation, BAD phosphorylation, and caspase-3 inactivation. Taken together, our results suggest that the reported favorable impact of diltiazem on kidney grafts is likely not because of its direct protection on renal tubular cells. Instead, it enhances the toxicity of CsA to renal tubular cells.

Its activity is increased in hypertension and heart failure and adversely affects prognosis. Although certain drugs inhibit SNS, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists may stimulate the system. Phenylalkylamine calcium antagonists such as verapamil have a different pharmacological profile. We therefore tested the hypothesis of whether amlodipine, nifedipine, or verapamil differs in the effects on muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSA). Forty-three patients (31 men, 12 women) with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly assigned to 1 drug for 8 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, and MSA (by microneurography) were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. All calcium antagonists led to a similar decrease in blood pressure of 5.0+/-1.5 to 6.4+/-1.4 mm Hg at 8 weeks (P<0.001 versus baseline). There were no significant differences in MSA between groups. With amlodipine, MSA averaged 49+/-3 bursts/min (3 versus baseline); with nifedipine, 48+/-3 bursts/min (2 versus baseline); and with verapamil, 49+/-2 bursts/min (all, P=NS). With verapamil, norepinephrine decreased by 4% but tended to increase by about one third with amlodipine or nifedipine (P=NS). Thus, in hypertension slow release forms of verapamil, nifedipine, and amlodipine exert comparable antihypertensive effects and do not change MSA, although there was a trend toward decreased MSA and plasma norepinephrine with verapamil.",5,E

Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured in 69 patients with essential hypertension (mild, n = 23; moderate, n = 29; and severe, n = 17 randomly assigned to treatment with either imidapril or amlodipine for 24 weeks in a double-blind fashion during reactive hyperemia and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin. Imidapril augmented the FBF response to reactive hyperemia after 24 weeks of treatment in the mild and moderate hypertensive groups, but not in the severe hypertensive group. The augmentation of the FBF response to reactive hyperemia induced by imidapril was significantly greater in the moderate hypertensive group than in the mild hypertensive group. Amlodipine did not alter the FBF response to reactive hyperemia. The increase in FBF after the sublingually administered nitroglycerin was similar in all groups. The infusion of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, abolished the enhancement of reactive hyperemia in the mild and moderate hypertensive groups treated with imidapril. These findings suggest that the effects of imidapril on endothelial function are affected by the severity of hypertension and that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced augmentation of reactive hyperemia may be due to increased nitric oxide production.",5,E

Atrial fibrillation is associated with a higher incidence of coronary events, stroke, and mortality than sinus rhythm. A fast ventricular rate associated with atrial fibrillation may cause tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Management of atrial fibrillation includes treatment of underlying causes and precipitating factors. Immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed in persons with atrial fibrillation associated with acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem may be used to immediately slow a fast ventricular rate associated with atrial fibrillation. An oral beta-blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem should be given to persons with atrial fibrillation if a rapid ventricular rate occurs a rest or during exercise despite digoxin. Amiodarone may be used in selected persons with symptomatic life-threatening atrial fibrillation refractory to other drug therapy. Nondrug therapies should be performed in persons with symptomatic atrial fibrillation in whom a rapid ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drug therapy. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation associated with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome should be managed with a permanent pacemaker in combination with drugs. A permanent pacemaker should be implanted in persons with atrial fibrillation in whom symptoms such as dizziness or syncope associated with non-drug-induced ventricular pauses longer than 3 seconds develop. Elective direct-current cardioversion has a higher success rate and a lower incidence of cardiac adverse effects than medical cardioversion in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Unless transesophageal echocardiography shows no thrombus in the left atrial appendage before cardioversion, oral warfarin should be given for 3 weeks before elective direct-current or drug cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and continued for at least 4 weeks after maintenance of sinus rhythm. Many cardiologists prefer the treatment strategy of ventricular rate control plus warfarin rather than to maintain sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs, especially in older patients. Digoxin should not be used in persons with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Patients with chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who are at high risk for stroke should be treated with long-term warfarin to achieve an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. Persons with atrial fibrillation who are at low risk for stroke or who have contraindications to warfarin should receive 325 mg aspirin daily.",5,E

The angiotensin II receptor-1 (AT(1)) antagonists losartan and irbesartan have recently been evaluated as renoprotective agents in large clinical trials of patients with Type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. In the Reduction of End points in Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist (RENAAL) study, losartan decreased the number of patients reaching the primary end point of a composite of measures of neuropathy. The relative risk reduction was approximately 15% with losartan and this was due to a reduction in both the doubling of creatinine concentration (25%) and of ESRD (28%) but not in death. In the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT), the beneficial effect of irbesartan was mainly against the doubling of the baseline creatinine concentration (37% risk reduction) but there was also a 20% reduction in the onset of ESRD. Irbesartan had no effect on mortality. Beneficial effects occurred in addition to blood pressure being controlled by agents other than the AT(1) antagonists. These clinical trials suggest that there may be a class renoprotective action with AT(1) antagonists, although the mechanism is not clear. Patients with Type 2 diabetes and nephropathy should receive either an AT(1) antagonist or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril to ensure renoprotection.",3,E

Acute blood pressure elevation may be precipitated by rectosigmoid distention and anal manipulation. Topical anesthetics are widely recommended to minimize the incidence and severity of autonomic dysreflexia, although no scientific evidence supports or refutes this practice. This study tested whether topical lidocaine would prevent or limit anorectal procedure-associated autonomic dysreflexia.; We enrolled patients with chronic, complete spinal cord injury scheduled for anoscopy and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy. In a double-blind fashion they were randomized to receive either 2% lidocaine jelly (n = 18) or nonmedicated lubricant (control; n = 32) just prior to the procedure. We measured blood pressure before, during, and after procedures.; Mean maximal systolic blood pressure increased 35 +/- 25 mmHg in the lidocaine group vs. 45 +/- 30 mmHg in the control group (NS). However, there was a significant difference between anoscopic procedures and flexible sigmoidoscopies without anoscopy (49 +/- 29 vs. 25 +/- 20 mmHg).; Topical lidocaine did not significantly limit or prevent autonomic dysreflexia in susceptible patients. Both anoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy caused significant blood pressure elevation. Anoscopy, which involves stretching of the anal sphincters, was a more potent stimulus for autonomic dysreflexia than flexible sigmoidoscopy, which involves gaseous distention of the rectosigmoid. Anal sphincter stretch and rectosigmoid distention, rather than a mucosal stimulus, are likely nociceptive triggers for procedure-associated autonomic dysreflexia.",3,E

Ten patients, six women and four men (mean age 48 +/- 14 years, range 25-67 years) were enrolled. Coronary flow velocity and coronary perfusion pressure were invasively measured at baseline, during intracoronary adenosine (1-mg bolus) and at 5, 15, and 30 min following IV amlodipine (10 or 20 mg). Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at baseline and at 5, 15, and 30 min after amlodipine.

The smaller studies produced mixed findings, especially those trials where CCBs were compared with diuretics; this may reflect methodological limitations and the impact of random error. The results from the four larger studies produced a consistent message: long-acting CCBs such as nifedipine, administered in a gastro-intestinal-transport-system (GITS) formulation, nitrendipine and diltiazem, reduce CV morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. In the one study that specifically enrolled high-risk hypertensive patients, nifedipine GITS was as effective as diuretic therapy in reducing CV events, and in all four larger studies sub-group analyses showed that the benefits of these CCBs extend to hypertensive patients with diabetes.

Also, the effect of these drugs on blood pressure, heart rate, renal functions and serum electrolytes, and their efficacy and tolerability in combination with digoxin were studied. This study was carried out in the Department of Medicine, Main Alexandria University Hospital, Alexandria, Egypt, during the period May 1999 through to May 2000.; Diltiazem caused a significant increase in digoxin maximum serum concentration without significant change in time to reach maximum concentration and the apparent volume of distribution. The total digoxin clearance was significantly reduced and the elimination half life was prolonged. Subsequently the area under time-concentration curve and the steady-state digoxin level were increased, but were still within therapeutic margin. On the other hand isosorbide dinitrate significantly increased digoxin maximum serum concentration but without change in the other digoxin pharmacokinetic parameters. Isosorbide dinitrate, but not diltiazem, caused significant reduction in supine and standing blood pressure, while both drugs did not significantly alter pulse rate, renal functions, serum sodium potassium and electrocardiographic pattern.; Patients who received diltiazem displayed a mean 51% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, 50% increase in mean steady state serum digoxin concentration, and 37% increase in peak serum digoxin concentration.

Reduction of blood pressure to levels around 120/80 mmHg is one of the most effective way to slow progression of diabetic nephropathy. Recent meta-analyses, however, have emphasized on the fact that ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NDHP-CCB) exert nephro-protective effects which go beyond the effect of blood pressure reduction. This has lately been confirmed by a prospective trial in comparison to the betablocker atenolol. Based on these data, demographics of the Swiss population, literature data on mortality rates of type 2 diabetics with impaired renal function and studies on true costs of antihypertensives, we calculated the costs of a longterm intervention (20 years) with antihypertensives in 3536 middle-aged Swiss patients with type 2 diabetes and macro-albuminuria whose antihypertensive regimen was based either on the ACEI lisinopril, or the ND-HP-CCB verapamil, or the betablocker atenolol. Under atenolol, acquisition costs were lowest, whereas faster loss of renal function over time increased mortality rate and thus reduced the number of patients to be treated. Nevertheless, due to the fact that patients reached uremia and had to be dialyzed, 20 years of atenolol-based regimen with costs of 316 millions of Swiss francs turned out to be much more expensive than the lisinopril- or the verapamil-based regimen with 121 and 38 millions of Swiss francs, respectively. Thus, low acquisition cost is not necessarily the only important determinant of overall costs of drug therapy.",1,E

This double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study investigated, using a factorial design, the interaction between a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking drug (felodipine 5 mg) and an angiotensin type I receptor blocking drug (candesartan 16 mg) on the control of BP as assessed by 24-h ambulatory monitoring. A total of 31 elderly patients with systolic hypertension completed all four arms of the study. Candesartan and felodipine lowered mean 24-h BP to a similar extent (candesartan 12.2 +/- 2.6/7.5 +/- 1.8; felodipine 11.9 +/- 2.2/5.7 +/- 1.4 mm Hg). The combination lowered it by 21.0 +/- 2.1/11.2 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, and this fall was significantly greater than with either of the monotherapies (P < .005) and was fully additive with no interactive term. The responder rate with the combination (90%) was greater than with candesartan (61%) or felodipine (55%). Microalbuminuria or proteinuria was present in 12 of 31 patients at randomization despite previous BP control. Candesartan and the combination both reduced urinary albumin excretion. Albumin excretion was not reduced by felodipine despite BP control similar to that achieved with candesartan. Side effects were infrequent and were fewer on the combination than on placebo or on the monotherapies. The combination of felodipine 5 mg and candesartan 16 mg has additive effects on BP in elderly patients with systolic hypertension. The combination was well tolerated and is suitable for use in patients who do not have an adequate response to monotherapy.",2,E

The survey covers the alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists, beta-blockers including topical eye medications, alpha-beta blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The lack of data on angiotensin II receptor blockers is noted although effects are considered to be similar to those reported with ACE inhibitors and therefore to be avoided. Analysis of the literature underscores that some antihypertensive drugs can be used safely at certain stages of pregnancy, while others are suspect and to be avoided at all costs. The lack of placebo-controlled studies on the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy due to ethical considerations is discussed against the background of the pressing need to treat these women despite the possible deleterious effects of antihypertensive drugs.",5,E

The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of two different, renin-angiotensin blocking combinations, on blood pressure (BP), albuminuria and glycemic control. Its design was prospective, randomised, controlled, of parallel branches, and performed in one Endocrinology Department, in Spain. 77 type-II diabetic patients, with stable albuminuria (30-1,000 mg/day) were included. After a pre-inclusion time of 2 weeks, patients were randomised to verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 (VT) or losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (LH) 20/12.5 mg/day. Duration of treatment was 1 year. The evaluated parameters were changes in blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion for 24 hours, glycated hemoglobin and plasmatic urea. Overall BP significantly decreased from 161.6 +/- 18.7/83.6 +/- 10.2 mmHg to 137.2 +/- 15.7/70.9 +/- 8.3 mmHg (p < 0.0005). Values, by treatment, were: For VT, 164.3 +/- 18.5/87.2 +/- 10.7 mmHg at baseline and 135.0 +/- 15.1/71.3 +/- 8.4 mmHg at conclusion. For LH, 158.8 +/- 17.4/80.1 +/- 8.4 mmHg at baseline and 139.3 +/- 16.1/70.5 +/- 8.2 mmHg at conclusion. Albuminuria significantly decreased from 308.2 +/- 544.7 mg/day to 198.0 +/- 285.3 mg/day. Both parameters showed no significant difference between treatments. Glycated hemoglobin decreased from 7.59 +/- 1.3% to 7.14 +/- 1.2% in the VT group, and from 7.96 +/- 1.29% to 7.84 +/- 1.62% in the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.022). Changes adjusted from baseline values showed a trend to the difference between both treatments (p = 0.092). Plasmatic urea increased from 39.8 +/- 12.7 to 40.5 +/- 11.1 mg/dL in the TV group and from 43.4 +/- 12.0 mg/dL to 52.4 +/- 19.4 mg/dL in the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.028). In conclusion, both treatments reduce blood pressure and albuminuria in a similar way in type II diabetic patients. The verapamil/trandolapril combination contributes to a better carbohydrate metabolism than losartan/hydroclorothiazide.",2,E

In a prospective, controlled, double-blind clinical trial, 42 patients with essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 95-114 mmHg) underwent an initial washout, drug free period of 2 weeks, after which they were randomized to receive either 30 mg of nifedipine in the test preparation ""XL"" (Nifecard) or 30 mg of nifedipine in a reference formulation, ""LA"", during six weeks. The response to treatment was assessed by measuring the blood pressure (BP) every two weeks (standard office mercury sphygmomanometry) and by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Of the 42 included patients 36 (85.5%) completed the trial: 19 on ""XL"" and 17 on ""LA"". After 2 weeks of therapy the DBP decreased by about 11% (-13.4 mmHg) and 10% (-9.5%), respectively, after 4 weeks the mean decrease versus the end of the placebo period reached about 14% (-15.5 mmHg) and 11% (-13 mmHg), and at the end of the trial the DBPs were lower by about 13% (-14.5 mmHg) in both groups. In all these measurements the within group differences were significant (p < 0.001), while the between groups differences were not (p > 0.05). Quite comparable results were obtained with ABPM, e.g. in the ""XL"" group the systolic blood pressure at the end of the study was lower by 12.3% (-4.6 mm Hg) and in the ""LA"" group, by 10.6% (-9.0 mm Hg); p = 0.358.

A prospective, randomized, 7-yr study was performed to examine the effect of rigorous (<120/80 mmHg) versus standard (135-140/85-90 mmHg) BP control on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and kidney function in 75 hypertensive ADPKD patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. LVMI was measured by echocardiogram at baseline and at 1 and 7 yr. Renal function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine and 24-h creatinine clearance every 6 mo for 3 yr, then annually for an additional 4 yr. The baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. During the study, average mean arterial pressure was 90 +/- 5 mmHg for the rigorous group and 101 +/- 4 mmHg for the standard group (P < 0.0001). The LVMI decreased by 21% in the standard group and by 35% in the rigorous group. A mixed model longitudinal data analysis revealed that rigorous BP control was significantly more effective in decreasing LVMI (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in renal function between the two groups. In conclusion, left ventricular hypertrophy, a major cardiovascular risk factor, was decreased to a significantly greater extent by rigorous than standard BP control. This finding has particular clinical importance because cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of death in ADPKD patients.",I,E

Patients were divided into those with target organ damage (TOD; n=107) and those free of end-organ damage. Plasma levels of soluble P-selectin (sP-sel), a marker of platelet activation, and von Willebrand factor (vWF), an index of endothelial damage/dysfunction (both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the rheological indices fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, hematocrit, platelet, and white cell count were measured. In 53 patients, variables were further measured after 6 months of intensified cardiovascular risk management. Patients with TOD had significantly higher vWF, 137 (SD 33) versus 125 (SD 33) IU/dL (P=0.002,) and a greater proportion of smokers, 31% versus 16% (P=0.002).

This emphasis has led to recommendations by some investigators that these agents not be used in the management of hypertension in this age group. There are numerous reasons why these recommendations should not be followed. The use of beta blockers in the elderly hypertensive has resulted in a reduction in strokes and congestive heart failure. In addition, it should be emphasized that elderly patients are more likely to have silent coronary artery disease or sustain myocardial infarctions. There is abundant evidence that beta blockers are effective therapy in reducing mortality once a myocardial infarction has occurred. In fact, there is a clear reduction in sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, national statistics document that elderly patients have a prevalence of congestive heart failure that varies from 6%-10%. Multiple studies have now documented that beta blockers are additive to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing mortality for congestive heart failure. Thus, elderly hypertensive patients may benefit from the use of beta blockers, especially if there is evidence of ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure.",5,E

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system lowers UAER, but whether this effect is independent of blood pressure (BP) reduction remains controversial. The MicroAlbuminuria Reduction With VALsartan (MARVAL) study was designed to evaluate the BP-independent effect of valsartan on UAER in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria.; Three hundred thirty-two patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, with or without hypertension, were randomly assigned to 80 mg/d valsartan or 5 mg/d amlodipine for 24 weeks. A target BP of 135/85 mm Hg was aimed for by dose-doubling followed by addition of bendrofluazide and doxazosin whenever needed. The primary end point was the percent change in UAER from baseline to 24 weeks. The UAER at 24 weeks was 56% (95% CI, 49.6 to 63.0) of baseline with valsartan and 92% (95% CI, 81.7 to 103.7) of baseline with amlodipine, a highly significant between-group effect (P<0.001). Valsartan lowered UAER similarly in both the hypertensive and normotensive subgroups. More patients reversed to normoalbuminuria with valsartan (29.9% versus 14.5%; P=0.001). Over the study period, BP reductions were similar between the two treatments (systolic/diastolic 11.2/6.6 mm Hg for valsartan, 11.6/6.5 mm Hg for amlodipine) and at no time point was there a between-group significant difference in BP values in either the hypertensive or the normotensive subgroup.; For the same level of attained BP and the same degree of BP reduction, valsartan lowered UAER more effectively than amlodipine in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, including the subgroup with baseline normotension. This indicates a BP-independent antiproteinuric effect of valsartan.",I,4

The aim of this study was (1) to evaluate the endothelial function in hypertensive patients (2) to investigate whether vitamin C administration has any benefit on the endothelial function and (3) to determine whether treatment with calcium antagonist improves endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients.; The endothelial function was estimated using venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP) in 8 hypertensive patients and 8 healthy volunteers. The patients in the hypertension group were treated with amlodipine, then examined again. The change of forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured with acetylcholine infusion through brachial artery and also with intra-arterial vitamin C.; Forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine was significantly enhanced with intra-arterial infusion of vitamin C in hypertensive group before antihypertensive treatment. Co-infusion of L-NMMA, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, blunted forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine. After treatment with amlodipine for 2 months in hypertensive group, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation to acetylcholine was significantly improved compared to pretreatment, and vitamin C did not affect the improved endothelial function by amlodipine treatment.; Vitamin C (acutely) and amlodipine (chronically) improved endothelial function in hypertensive patients. These results suggest that increased oxidative stress, at least in part, may be involved in the decreased endothelial function in hypertension.",5,E

Fifty-nine Chinese patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were randomized to receive either barnidipine or felodipine (5 mg once daily, titrated to 10 mg or 15 mg once daily, as indicated) for 12 weeks. Both drugs reduced blood pressures significantly with > or = 68% of cases obtaining marked or moderate blood pressure reduction. Mean reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure for barnidipine treatment were 23.7 +/- 13.5 mmHg and 12.7 +/- 7.9 mmHg, and for felodipine, 24.3 +/- 18.4 mmHg and 14.5 +/- 10.0 mmHg, respectively. There was no significant difference between these two drugs in anti-hypertensive effect, heart rate, laboratory measurements or incidence of adverse events. The only difference was that more patients taking felodipine experienced palpitations.

The dosage of ER felodipine was doubled to 10 mg/day and given for a further 2 weeks in non-responders (sitting clinic blood pressure > 140/90mm Hg). The study had an open-label design with no placebo control. After each period, clinic and ambulatory blood pressures were measured. Trough-to-peak (T/P) ratio was computed by dividing the blood pressure (BP) change at trough (22 to 24 hours after drug intake) by the change at peak (2 adjacent hours with a maximal BP reduction between the second and eighth hour after drug intake). SI was calculated as the ratio between the average of the 24, hourly, treatment-induced BP changes and its standard deviation.; After the initial 2-week treatment period, clinic and 24-hour ambulatory BP values were higher in non-responders (145 +/- 11/87 +/- 8 and 135 +/- 17/80 +/- 6mm Hg, respectively) than in responders (133 +/- 6/81 +/- 3 and 130 +/- 9/77 +/- 7mm Hg).

This study analyzed the data from the Syst-Eur trial, which was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention trial in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. The purpose was to evaluate whether serum levels of creatinine and uric acid and urinary protein excretion at entry are related to subsequent morbidity and mortality. Incidence rates of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke (fatal as well as nonfatal), coronary events, and all cardiovascular endpoints were calculated for each quintile of serum creatinine or serum uric acid or for each category of protein excretion (none, trace, and overt). Crude and adjusted relative hazard rates were also determined for each 20 micro M increase in serum creatinine, each 50 micro M increase in serum uric acid, and for each protein excretion category. Even when adjusted for age, gender, and various other covariates, serum creatinine was significantly associated with a worse prognosis. There was an U-shaped relationship between serum uric acid and total mortality, but otherwise no obvious relationships were detected between serum uric acid levels and complications when appropriate adjustments were made for confounding variables. Proteinuria at entry was a significant predictor of total mortality and all cardiovascular endpoints. It is concluded that higher levels of serum creatinine and trace or overt proteinuria are associated with an increased number of cardiovascular events and with a higher mortality in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.",I,6

CTRA demonstrated surgically correctable etiology of hypertension in 38% of the patients [5 with renal artery stenosis (RAS) and 4 with renal pathology]. In 5 patients, CTRA findings of RAS were confirmed by catheter angiogram. CTRA missed RAS in 1 patient in whom catheter angiogram showed beaded narrowing of the renal artery. All 6 patients with RAS had resolution of hypertension immediately after angioplasty or surgery. One patient with diffuse renal artery stenosis had an ipsilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney. In this patient hypertension resolved spontaneously as the dysplastic kidney shrunk in size. Seven patients had a renal etiology for hypertension. In 3 of these patients hypertension resolved after nephrectomy. Malignant hypertension in the 4th patient with reflux nephropathy was controlled medically after she underwent bilateral ureteral reimplantation. The remaining 3 patients with renal etiology were managed medically. We found that the etiology was central for hypertension in 4 patients with brain abnormalities, obesity in 1 overweight patient, essential hypertension in 4 patients, and thoracic aorta coarctation in 1 patient. Our study showed that in all except 1 instance CTRA could diagnose a surgically correctable cause for hypertension.

We administered isradipine, a short-acting, second-generation calcium antagonist, to 72 such children. Retrospective data collection was undertaken to determine the effects of isradipine treatment. The mean age of children treated with isradipine was 74+/-55 months (mean+/-SD). Nearly all of these children had secondary hypertension and were initially treated as hospital inpatients for newly diagnosed hypertension. Mean isradipine dose was 0.36+/-0.17 mg/kg per day, with no significant variation in dose according to patient age. Isradipine was administered three times per day in most instances, but 21% of the time it was administered four times per day. An extemporaneous isradipine suspension was used in 62% of treatment courses. BP control was achieved with isradipine alone in 38 children; the remainder received isradipine in combination with additional antihypertensives. Comparison of pre-treatment BP with BP obtained 8+/-9 days later demonstrated a significant BP reduction with isradipine treatment, with a mean reduction of 14+/-13 mmHg for systolic BP and 13+/-15 mmHg for diastolic BP. There was no effect of isradipine treatment on heart rate. Adverse effects occurred in 9.5% of treatment courses, and included headache, flushing, dizziness, and tachycardia. We conclude that isradipine successfully lowers BP in hypertensive children with secondary forms of hypertension. Use of isradipine suspension allows infants and young children to be treated as readily as older children.",4,E

Carvedilol, alpha1-beta-blocker with strong antioxidant activity, may interfere with this chain of events. Therefore, we measured monocyte ecNOS, TGFbeta and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA level and plasma nitrite/nitrate, 3-nitrotyrosine, an estimate of peroxynitrite, and total plasma antioxidant power in kidney-transplanted patients with post-transplant hypertension, before and after treatment with carvedilol, 25 - 50 mg o.d. orally for 4 months (n = 15). The dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine (n = 10) was used as comparator antihypertensive drug. Blood pressure fell to a similar extent with both drugs. Carvedilol increased plasma antioxidant power and HO-1 mRNA and reduced 3-nitrotyrosine and TGFbeta mRNA levels, while the same was not observed with nifedipine. Monocyte ec NOS mRNA levels and plasma nitrite/nitrate were higher in the patients than in a normotensive healthy control group and were unaffected by either treatment. In conclusion, carvedilol reduces the oxidative stress and corrects the altered cellular signaling mediated by oxidative stress in CsA-induced post-transplant hypertension. Therefore, it may prevent long-term complications, such as endothelial dysfunction, fibrogenesis and post-transplant nephropathy by decreasing NO degradation and production of TGFbeta, a key fibrogenic cytokine, and by activating HO-1 production.",6,E

A comprehensive headache treatment plan includes acute attack treatment to relieve pain and impairment and long-term preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration. Circumstances that might warrant preventive treatment include: (i) migraine that significantly interferes with the patient's daily routine despite acute treatment; (ii) failure, contraindication to, or troublesome side-effects from acute medications; (iii) overuse of acute medications; (iv) special circumstances, such as hemiplegic migraine; (v) very frequent headaches (more than two a week); or (vi) patient preference. Start the drug at a low dose. Give each treatment an adequate trial. Avoid interfering, overused, and contraindicated drugs. Re-evaluate therapy. Be sure that a woman of childbearing potential is aware of any potential risks. Involve patients in their care to maximize compliance. Consider co-morbidity. Choose a drug based on its proven efficacy, the patient's preferences and headache profile, the drug's side-effects, and the presence or absence of coexisting or co-morbid disease. Drugs that have documented high efficacy and mild to moderate adverse events (AEs) include beta-blockers, amitriptyline, and divalproex. Drugs that have lower documented efficacy and mild to moderate AEs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel antagonists, gabapentin, topiramate, riboflavin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",4,E

Their systolic blood pressure at entry was 160 to 219 mm Hg, with diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg. Antihypertensive therapy was started immediately after randomization in the active treatment group, but only after termination of the double-blind trial in the control patients. Treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/d), with the possible addition of enalapril maleate (5-20 mg/d), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/d), or both add-on drugs.; Median follow-up increased from 2.0 years in the double-blind trial to 3.9 years overall.

For several drugs, there is a higher incidence in women of drug-induced QT prolongation and a potentially fatal arrhythmia, torsades de pointes. This may be a reflection of the longer baseline QT interval in women. A difference in cardiovascular disease between women and men is that women have a higher mortality rate after myocardial infarction (MI). Women also have a higher rate of hemorrhagic stroke after receiving thrombolytic therapy for an MI. Differences in effectiveness of analgesics have been demonstrated, with kappa opioids providing pain relief for women but not men. Drugs may have different pharmacokinetics in women and men because of differences in phase I and phase II enzymes that metabolize drugs. Conflicting results about biological sex differences have been reported for the major drug metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome P450 3A4 (3A4) and may be related to a role for P-glycoprotein, a cell membrane transporter, reported as two times higher in male livers than those of females. It has been reported that boys need a higher dose of 6-mercaptopurine, which is metabolized by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT is reported to be 14% higher in male human liver biopsies than those from females. Verapamil, a drug for angina and hypertension, has different clearance and side effects in men and women.

Although GI injury and obstruction are known effects of oral medications, some reports have suggested that extended-release products pose a greater risk of GI injury and obstruction than other oral dosage forms. Products incorporating OROS technology are being prescribed to an expanding range of patients; a review of the GI safety data for this dosage form thus seemed timely and appropriate. US safety information was obtained from three sources: English language literature published from 1982 until June 1, 2000 from five major biomedical databases;postmarketing safety reports from January 1, 1983 until June 1, 2000 available through the Freedom of Information Act; andcommercial safety information obtained directly from ALZA Corporation's in-house safety database for those OSM products for which ALZA has reporting responsibility. US distribution data from IMS National Prescription Audit trade mark Plus data were used to estimate cumulative product distribution totals. These totals were combined with numbers of unique GI events to determine the estimated frequency of events.; Nearly 13 billion OSM tablets are estimated to have been distributed in the US. The incidence of all clinically significant GI adverse events for OSM products (including intestinal, gastric, and oesophageal irritation, injury, and obstruction) reported in the US was approximately one case in >76 million tablets distributed. The majority (78%; estimated incidence: one case in 29 million tablets) of cases were reported in patients taking Procardia XL (nifedipine). Oesophageal and lower GI obstruction were reported primarily in patients with pre-existing abnormalities or disease of the GI tract. Among paediatric patients, one obstruction was reported in an estimated 37.7 million tablets distributed. Reports of GI irritation associated with OSM products were consistent with known effects of the same drug substances in other dosage forms.; A review of long-term safety experience with products using OSM controlled-release technology yields a low incidence of clinically significant GI events.

This study investigated the relationships among the coronary vasospastic regions, abnormal left ventricular regional wall motion, fatty acid metabolism, and sympathetic nerve functions and their changes during treatment in patients with vasospastic angina.; We evaluated 50 patients with vasospastic angina (25 with clinically documented vasospasm [group A] and 25 with vasospasm induced by ergonovine provocation [group B]) and 25 control subjects who had chest pain but had normal coronary arteries without ergonovine provocation of spasm. Sixteen patients in group A were reevaluated 6 mo after medical treatment.

Despite the inability to cure the disease, therapeutic advances over the past 20 years have contributed to an improvement of quality of life and prolonged survival in PPH patients. Current therapeutic approach of PPH mostly includes limitation of physical activity, long-term anticoagulation, and vasodilator therapy. Among all tested oral vasodilators, calcium-channel blockers are the most efficient long-term therapies by improving symptoms and hemodynamics in a subset of PPH patients (10% to 15%) who acutely respond to such drugs. Acute pulmonary vasodilator response to inhalation of nitric oxide can predict acute and chronic responses to oral calcium-channel blockers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of PPH has changed the focus of medical treatments from purely chronic vasodilator therapy to the evaluation of agents, such as prostaglandins, that may reverse the proliferation of pulmonary vascular cells and result in regression of the pulmonary vascular hypertrophy and remodeling. Long-term treatment with intravenous epoprostenol (prostaglandin I(2) or prostacyclin) improves exercise capacity, hemodynamics and survival in most patients with PPH in functional class NYHA III or IV, and may be currently considered as the ""gold standard"" therapy for severe patients. However, response to long-term epoprostenol therapy may be incomplete, adverse effects are common, and survival remains unsatisfactory (55% at 5 years). In such patients with severe pulmonary hypertension refractory to medical therapy, atrioseptostomy and lung transplantation can be indicated.",5,E

Cognitive complications of hypertension and the influence of anti-hypertensive treatment were underestimated until recently. In this paper, trials investigating the effect of anti-hypertensive treatment on cognitive function were evaluated. Analysis of these studies revealed that until approximately 1990-1995 investigations have assessed primarily if anti-hypertensive treatment impaired cognitive function. Only more recent studies have investigated positive effects on cognition of anti-hypertensive medication. Drugs more extensively evaluated were diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, sartanes and Ca(2+) channel blockers. Available studies have confirmed that elevated diastolic blood pressure or pulse pressure and isolated systolic hypertension play an important role in the development of cognitive impairment. Randomized placebo-controlled trials have provided evidence that reduction of hypertension safely and effectively decreases morbidity and mortality rates and cognitive complications of hypertension. Ca(2+) channel blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective and probably better than diuretics and beta-blockers on cognitive domains of hypertension. More extensive investigations could contribute to establishing optimal choice and drug dosage for the treatment of cognitive complications of hypertension.",5,E

The incidence increases markedly with advancing age. Thus, with the growing proportion of elderly individuals, atrial fibrillation will come to represent a significant medical and socioeconomic problem. The consequences of atrial fibrillation have the greatest impact. The risk of thromboembolism is well known; other outcomes of atrial fibrillation are less well recognised, such as its relationship with dementia, depression and death. Such consequences are responsible for diminished quality of life and considerable economic cost. Atrial fibrillation is characterised by rapid and disorganised atrial activity, with a frequency between 300 and 600 beats/minute. The ventricles react irregularly, and may contract rapidly or slowly depending on the health of the conduction system. Clinical symptoms are varied, including palpitations, syncope, dizziness or embolic events. Atrial fibrillation may be paroxysmal, persistent or chronic, and a number of attacks are asymptomatic. Suspicion or confirmation of atrial fibrillation necessitates investigation and, as far as possible, appropriate treatment of underlying causes such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism and congestive heart failure. In the evaluation of atrial fibrillation, cardiac exploration is invaluable, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography, with the aim of detecting cardiac abnormalities and directing management. In elderly patients (arbitrarily defined as aged >75 years), the management of atrial fibrillation varies; it requires an individual approach, which largely depends on comorbid conditions, underlying cardiac disease, and patient and physician preferences. This management is essentially based on pharmacological treatment, but there are also nonpharmacological options. Two alternatives are possible: restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, or control of ventricular rate, leaving the atria in arrhythmia. Pharmacological options include antiarrhythmic drugs, such as class III agents, beta-blockers and class IC agents. These drugs have some adverse effects, and careful monitoring is necessary. The nonpharmacological approach to atrial fibrillation includes external or internal direct-current cardioversion and new methods, such as catheter ablation of specific foci, an evolving science that has been shown to be successful in a very select group of atrial fibrillation patients. Another serious challenge in the management of chronic atrial fibrillation in older individuals is the prevention of stroke, its primary outcome, by choosing an appropriate antithrombotic treatment (aspirin or warfarin). Several risk-stratification schemes have been validated and may be helpful to determine the best antithrombotic choice in individual patients.",5,E

It is generally agreed that such CCBs should not be used alone in the management of hypertension.; We have determined the extent to which primary care physicians prescribe CCBs as monotherapy, especially the immediate release formulations, in the management of uncomplicated hypertension and diabetic hypertension - with an emphasis upon the age of the patients. SETTING, DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective prescription-based study was carried out in seven out of 18 Health Centres in Bahrain. The study involved a registered population of 229,300 representing 46% of registered individuals, and 35 physicians representing 43% of all primary care physicians. The data was collected between November 1998 and January 1999 using chronic dispensing cards.; In all categories CCBs were the third commonly prescribed antihypertensive as monotherapy, with a prescription rate of 11.1% in uncomplicated hypertension, 18% in diabetic hypertension and 20.1% in elderly patients above 65 years of age. Nifedipine formulations were the most extensively prescribed CCBs. Almost half of the CCB-treated patients were on IR-nifedipine, whereas IR-diltiazem and IR-verapamil, and amlodipine were infrequently prescribed.; Prescription of IR-formulations of CCBs as monotherapy by primary care physicians does not conform with recommended guidelines. In view of concerns about the safety of such practice, measures to change the prescribing pattern are required.",6,E

Accordingly, this epidemic is likely to translate into a major increase in healthcare costs. Systolic heart failure is the most common cause of CHF presentations. Although the causes vary, the most common single aetiological factor is ischaemic heart disease, which accounts for approximately 50% of heart failure presentations. Research into CHF pharmacotherapy has been copious, with the focus principally centred on systolic heart failure. The evidence base for pharmacotherapy in CHF is amongst the largest currently in clinical medicine. There have been multiple trials establishing the mortality and morbidity benefits of pharmacotherapy. Amongst these, large scale trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and spironolactone have provided a sound basis for evidence-based treatment approaches to the CHF patient. Recently research interest has increased in biomedical engineering with studies being performed in biventricular pacing and mechanical hearts. Early data with biventricular pacing or cardiac resynchronisation therapy is encouraging. Diastolic heart failure alone accounts for at least 20 - 40% of CHF presentations and whilst it may occur in isolation, is most commonly seen in association with systolic heart failure. In this study, we present a broad overview of the current therapeutic modalities for the management of CHF, with particular emphasis on pharmacotherapy.",5,E

This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial was designed to compare the persistence of the antihypertensive efficacy of the amlodipine and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) after two 'missed doses', and also to compare the drugs' overall efficacy and safety in Asian patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Following a 2-week placebo run-in period, 222 patients were randomised to receive either amlodipine (5 mg daily, increased after 6 weeks if necessary to 10 mg daily, n=109) or nifedipine GITS (30 mg daily, increased after 6 weeks if necessary to 60 mg daily; n=113) for 12 weeks. A placebo was then substituted for further 2 days with continuous ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The increases in the last 9 h of mean ambulatory BP on day 2 after treatment withdrawal were significantly less with amlodipine than with nifedipine GITS: 4.4+/-7.0 vs 11.2+/-11.3 mmHg for systolic BP (P<or=0.0001) and 2.4+/-6.3 vs 6.0+/-6.0 mmHg for diastolic BP (P<or=0.0002). Significant differences between the two drugs in mean 24-h ambulatory BP levels were already evident on day 1 after withdrawal, even though there were no significant differences on the final day of treatment. No differences in safety parameters were observed, and neither drug caused any serious or severe treatment-related adverse events.

The aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio (ARR) is routinely used as a screening test. Antihypertensive therapy can interfere with the interpretation of this parameter, but a correct washout period can be potentially harmful. We have investigated the effects of therapy with atenolol, amlodipine, doxazosin, fosinopril, and irbesartan on the ARR in a group of 230 patients with suspected primary aldosteronism. The percent change from control of ARR in patients taking amlodipine was -17%+/-32; atenolol, 62%+/-82; doxazosin, -5%+/-26; fosinopril, -30%+/-24; and irbesartan, -43%+/-27. The ARR change induced by atenolol was significantly higher compared with that induced by all other drugs (P<0.0001), and the ARR change induced by irbesartan was significantly lower than that induced by doxazosin (P<0.0001). One of 55 patients from the group taking amlodipine (1.8%) and 4/17 of the patients taking irbesartan (23.5%) gave a false-negative ARR (<50). None of the patients of the groups taking fosinopril, doxazosin, and atenolol displayed a false-negative ARR. Doxazosin and fosinopril can be used in hypertensive patients who need to undergo aldosterone and PRA measurement for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism; amlodipine gave a very small percentage of false-negative diagnoses. beta-Blockers also do not interfere with the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, but they can be responsible for an increased rate of false-positive ARRs. The high rate of false-negative diagnoses in patients undergoing irbesartan treatment requires confirmation in a higher number of patients.",2,E

Treatment practices vary considerably to because of the lack of evidence supporting the use of one therapeutic agent over another. This paper was designed to review the evidence for various pharmacotherapeutic regimens in the management of hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, in terms of the agents' abilities to reach predetermined ""safe"" goal blood pressures (BPs), and to prevent adverse events.; medline was searched from 1966 to 2001, and the reference lists of all the articles were retrieved and searched for relevant references, and experts in the field were contacted to identify other relevant studies. The Cochrane Library was also searched. Studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review were systematic reviews of randomized control trials (RCTs) and individual RCTs, all-or-none studies, systematic reviews of cohort studies and individual cohort studies, and outcomes research. No language restrictions were used.; None of the trials included in this review identified an optimal rate of BP lowering in hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. The definitions of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies were not consistent, but emergencies always involved target end-organ damage, and urgencies were without such damage. Measures of outcome were not uniform between studies. The 4 hypertensive emergency and 15 hypertensive urgency studies represented 236 and 1,074 patients, respectively. The evidence indicated a nonsignificant trend toward increased efficacy with urapidil compared to nitroprusside for hypertensive emergencies (number needed to treat [NNT] for urapidil to achieve target BP, 12; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], number of patients needed to harm [NNH], 5 to NNT, 40 compared to nitroprusside). Several medications were efficacious in treating hypertensive urgencies, including: nicardipine (NNT for nicardipine compared to plabebo, 2 in one study [95% CI, 1 to 5] and 1 in another [95% CI, 1 to 1]); lacidipine (NNT, 2; 95% CI, 1 to 8 for lacidipine vs nifedipine) or urapidil (NNT for urapidil compared to enalaprilat and nifedipine, 4; 95% CI, 3 to 6); and nitroprusside and fenoldopam (all patients reached target BP in 2 studies). The studies reported 2 cases of cerebral ischemia secondary to nifedipine.; Many effective agents exist for the treatment of hypertensive crises. Because of the lack of large randomized controlled trials, many questions remain unanswered, such as follow-up times and whether any of the studied agents have mortality benefit.",I,2

We investigated the effects of indapamide, nicardipine, propranolol, and chlorthalidone on arterial blood pressure and LV mass and function.; Sixty-four patients (34 men and 30 women) completed the 6-month study. No significant differences in antihypertensive effects of the four medications were found. The average decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 12.8% and 10.4%, respectively. All four antihypertensive medications caused pronounced reduction in LV mass, between 7.9% in the propranolol group and 10.1% in the nicardipine group, with no significant difference between the groups. In patients receiving diuretics, predominant decrease was observed in LV mass and LV mass index. In patients treated with propranolol, the thickness of both the LV wall and interventricular septum was reduced, whereas the reduction in LV mass, LV wall and interventricular septum thickness was found in patients treated with nicardipine. There was no significant correlation between the changes in LV mass and other variables (blood pressure, and systolic and diastolic function). Systolic function did not improve with the reversion of LV hypertrophy in any group of patients, but improvement was observed in some indices of diastolic function. The early and late LV filling velocity and their ratio did not improve significantly, either. Clinically relevant side effects were not observed.; All four antihypertensive monotherapies achieved a comparable control of hypertension and reduction in LV hypertrophy.",2,E

However, these patients often will have significant co-morbidities that may influence the choice of medication, a decision that also may be affected by cost or Health Plan directives. Wherever possible, monotherapy should be attempted first, although in select circumstances combination therapy may be more appropriate. The 5 main categories of drugs used in the initial treatment of hypertensive vascular diseases are (1). diuretics, (2). beta-adrenergic blockers, (3). calcium channel blockers, (4). angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and (5). angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There are also other less commonly used drugs. Each of the antihypertensive agents is roughly equally effective, producing a good antihypertensive response in 40% to 60% of cases. Some antihypertensives, especially ACE and ARBs, also may have beneficial effects on the vascular and metabolic systems separate from their blood pressure lowering effects, which suggests they may be beneficial even if blood pressure is well maintained with other agents. This report covers the basic information required for the vascular surgeon to become familiar with the various medications and their indications, dosage, and side effects. It also provides some guidelines in selecting relevant antihypertensive treatment regimens for the elderly patient with arterial vascular disease.",5,E

The aim of the study reported here was to evaluate the presence of macrophage subpopulations in normal human gingiva and in gingival overgrowth induced by nifedipine and immunosuppressive medication.; Gingival samples were taken from 11 nifedipine-medicated cardiac outpatients (nifedipine group), 11 triple-medicated organ-transplant recipients also taking nifedipine (immunosuppression plus nifedipine group), 12 triple-medicated organ-transplant recipients (immunosuppression group), and 20 generally healthy individuals (control group). Cryostat sections were stained with mAbs for inflammatory 27E10, reparative RM3/1, and resident 25F9 macrophages using an avidin-biotin enzyme complex method. Total numbers of mAb-labeled cells were determined in connective tissue beneath sulcular epithelium, connective tissue beneath oral epithelium, and middle connective tissue. Expression of 27E10 was determined in keratinocytes in the oral epithelium. Statistics analyses were undertaken using the chi-square test, the Mann-Whitney U test, the independent samples t test, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance.; Greater numbers of inflammatory 27E10-positive macrophages were found in all 3 medicated groups and counting zones than in the control group except in connective tissue beneath sulcular epithelium in the immunosuppression group. The incidence of specimens expressing 27E10 antigen throughout the oral epithelium was significantly higher in the immunosuppression group (8 of 12) than in the control group (4 of 20) and the nifedipine group (2 of 11). Numbers of reparative RM3/1-positive macrophages were significantly greater in the immunosuppression group in connective tissue beneath oral epithelium than in the control group. The effect was markedly associated with degree of inflammation. Numbers of resident 25F9-positive macrophages were lower in connective tissue beneath sulcular epithelium in the immunosuppression group, and higher in middle connective tissue in the nifedipine group than in the control group.; Our results show that the nature of drug-induced gingival overgrowth differs somewhat between immunosuppressive and nifedipine medications.",I,E

Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease).; Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, with no difference between treatments.

In the present study, we investigated the influence of type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM) on the enantioselective pharmacokinetic and dynamic parameters of N.; Seventeen hypertensive patients, nine of them with DM, were investigated in a cross-over study with administration of rac-N as coat-core tablets (20 mg day(-1)) or placebo for 15 days each. Serial blood samples (0-24 h) were collected on the 15th day, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was simultaneously evaluated. N enantiomers in plasma samples were analysed using chiral high-performance liquid chromatography combined with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The enantiomeric ratios differing from one were evaluated using the Wilcoxon test, and the results are reported as means with the 95% confidence intervals. A lidocaine (L) test was carried out as an in vivo marker of CYP3A4 (and CYP1A2) activities.; The following differences were observed between the (+)-N and (-)-N enantiomers, respectively, in the patients presenting with DM (means and ranges): C(max) 3.9 (1.7-6.1) ng ml(-1) versus 0.7 (0.4-1.0) ng ml(-1), AUC(0-24) 51.5 (29.0-74.0) ng ml(-1) h versus 9.4 (5.9-12.8) ng ml(-1) h, and Cl/f 3.6 (1.9-5.4) l h(-1) kg(-1) versus 18.7 (11.7-25.7) l h(-1) kg(-1). The Cl/f value of (+)-N was lower (Mann-Whitney test) in patients with DM: 6.0 (4.3-7.5) l h(-1) kg(-1) versus 3.6 (1.9-5.4) l h(-1) kg(-1). The same observation was made for the (-)-N, with Cl/f reaching 38.8 (26.8-51.0) l h(-1) kg(-1) and 18.7 (11.7-25.7) l h(-1) kg(-1) for the non-diabetic and DM groups, respectively. The L test resulted in higher ratios (P < 0.05) of plasma L/MEGX concentrations (30 min after i.v. L) for DM (11.1 vs 18.6). N significantly reduced systolic and diastolic BP (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test) in all patients investigated relative to placebo. No differences in BP reduction were observed between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. N significantly increased noradrenaline concentrations in plasma of both patient groups. The data also demonstrated that the plasma concentrations of noradrenaline 30 min after N administration were lower (P < 0.05) in diabetic (mean 2.86 pmol ml(-1)) than in non-diabetic patients (4.80 pmol ml(-1)).; The present data permit us to infer that type-2 diabetes mellitus alters the kinetic disposition of the (+)-N eutomer and (-)-N distomer, presumably due to a lower activity of CYP3A4, although it does not modify the clinical effect brought about by the reduction in BP.",2,E

The medical staff often becomes frustrated by severe hypertension in those who refuse to take medicines at home, drink excessive fluids, miss multiple dialysis sessions and sign-off dialysis early. In addition to addressing the psychosocial, financial, educational and substance abuse problems which contribute to noncompliance, we have developed a medication strategy to serve as an at least interim means of lowering blood pressure. Antihypertensive agents which have long half-lives in renal failure (lisinopril) and/or are intrinsically long acting (transdermal clonidine and amlodipine) were administered on dialysis days by the unit personnel to those patients who did not or would not take that or any dose on their own. The lisinopril and amlodipine were assured to have been taken on at least the dialysis days (thrice weekly), and the clonidine patch replaced weekly. Sixteen patients were thus treated when they failed to reliably self-administer medications. They had a significant decline in the predialysis systolic pressure of 15 mm Hg (175 +/- 6 to 160 +/- 5 mm Hg), diastolic of 12 mm Hg (103 +/- 3 to 91 +/- 3 mm Hg), and mean pressure of 13 mm Hg (127 +/- 4 to 114 +/- 4 mm Hg). There was an improvement in post-dialysis bood pressures, with the mean pressure declining 13 mm Hg from 110 +/- 4 to 97 +/- 4 mm Hg. Many individuals had erratic blood pressure control, having intermittently missed dialysis and hence unit-administered medicine, as well as continued fluid or drug abuse. The patients had uniformly excellent acceptance of this regimen, even spontaneously requesting it, and had no appreciable adverse effects. In summary while noncompliance is being addressed by the entire medical team, dialysis unit administration of long-acting medicines helps many hypertensive dialysis patients who would otherwise be at increased risk for severe cardiovascular complications.",2,E

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of nicorandil, an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel opener, on no-reflow in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of nicorandil on no-reflow/slow flow phenomenon during RA procedures. Sixty-one patients who underwent RA of complex coronary lesions were randomly divided into 2 groups: (i) nicorandil cocktail (n=24 patients, 37 lesions) and (ii) verapamil cocktail (n=37 patients, 63 lesions). In each group, the drug cocktail mixed with pressurized saline was infused through the 4Fr Teflon sheath of the rotablator system during the RA procedure. In the nicorandil group, the drug cocktail consisted of 24 mg of nicorandil, 5 mg of nitroglycerin, and 10,000 U of heparin. In the verapamil group, the drug cocktail consisted of 10 mg of verapamil, 5 mg of nitroglycerin, and 10,000 U of heparin. Baseline and procedure characteristics did not differ between the 2 groups. RA was performed successfully, and death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or emergency coronary artery bypass surgery did not occur in any patients. The no-reflow/slow flow phenomenon was observed in 11/63 (17.4%) lesions of the verapamil group, but in only 1/37 (2.7%) lesions of the nicorandil group (p=0.03). No untoward complications were observed during nicorandil infusion. These data indicate that the intracoronary continuous infusion of nicorandil during RA procedures is easy and safe, and prevents no-reflow/slow flow phenomenon more effectively than infusion of verapamil.",4,E

The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that efficacy of medication therapy for hypertension is identical in any grading of severity of baseline blood pressure. The authors retrospectively analysed ABPM data from mild to moderate hypertensive patients. Efficacy in decreasing blood pressure by antihypertensives has linear relation to baseline blood pressure. Response to antihypertensive agents in white-coat hypertension is minimal but a significant effect still persists and the possibility of hypotensive adverse events from medication in the case cannot be overlooked.",2,E

We report a case of severe hyponatraemia associated with deep coma, seizure, atrial fibrillation and muscle damage in a 92-year-old woman after only two doses of citalopram, and review 14 cases previously published in the literature and 28 cases spontaneously reported to Australian Drug Reaction Advisory Committee (ADRAC). The data presented suggest that citalopram, as well as SSRIs may cause hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). The majority of symptomatic cases occurred in elderly patients (79% were older than 70 years) and in women (74%). Polymedication and concomitant use of another psychotropic drug or thiazide diuretic may precipitate and/or augment the development of hyponatraemia/SIADH. In 84% of cases, the hyponatraemia associated with citalopram was detected during the first month of treatment. High level of suspicion, close and careful monitoring of serum sodium concentration particularly in elderly patients and especially in the first month of therapy with citalopram may reduce the incidence of this serious and likely not rare adverse effect.",3,E

In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the observed association between CCB and cancer in earlier studies could be explained by residual confounding or by misclassification of exposure because of the use of cross-sectional data on drug use. Data from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study in the municipal area Ommoord, were used. The study population consisted of a cohort of 3204 participants aged 71 years or older who were followed from a baseline interview in the period 1991-1993 for the occurrence of incident cancer. Data on drug use were gathered at baseline and through the seven community pharmacies which served the Ommoord region during the study period between 1 January 1991 and 1 January 1999. Incident cancer events were gathered from a nationwide registry of hospitalisation data and from a specialised cancer centre in the Rotterdam region. We performed three analyses. First, we followed the method, and adjusted for the same risk factors, as in the earlier studies. In the second analysis, we included all risk factors that were univariately associated with cancer in the Rotterdam Study. In the third analysis, we included exposure to CCBs as time-varying co-variates, while adjusting for potential confounders. The relative risk (RR) of cancer associated with CCB was 1.4 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.9-2.0) in the first analysis and lowered to 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8-1.8) upon adjustment for the different co-variates in the second. In both analyses, however, verapamil was significantly associated with cancer with RRs of 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.0) and 2.0 (1.01-3.9), respectively, whereas no associations were found with the other CCB in this study, i.e. diltiazem and nifedipine. A significantly increased risk of cancer was found for intermediate daily doses of verapamil and diltiazem. Intake of other antihypertensives such as beta-blocking agents, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors was not associated with cancer. In the third analysis with exposure to CCB as time-varying co-variates, the risk increase was non-significant for use of 2 years or less, 1.0 (95% CI: 0.7-1.5), and for use for a cumulative period of more than 2 years, 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.0). However, in all models the hazard ratio was statistically significantly increased for verapamil, but not for diltiazem and nifedipine. On the basis of these analyses, we found no increase in cancer in users of diltiazem and nifedipine, nor in users of other antihypertensives. In line with earlier studies, however, we found an increased risk of cancer in users of verapamil. At variance with the conclusions from several other studies, we think that it is too early to conclude that CCB are not associated with cancer.",I,I

In this randomized-controlled study, we aimed to compare the effect of doxazosin and amlodipine on IR in patients with CRF. Fifteen patients with CRF (male/female: 5/10, mean age: 46 +/- 13 years) and 9 controls (male/female: 3/6, mean age: 35 +/- 8 years) were included. Patients and controls had no family history of diabetes mellitus. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was calculated as a marker of IR. Patients were grouped randomly to doxazosin (n = 8; 2-4 mg/day) and amlodipine (n = 7; 5-10 mg/day) arms. Baseline biochemical analysis (fasting serum glucose, BUN, creatinine, uric acid, cholesterol and cholesterol subgroups) and parameters related with insulin metabolism (insulin, C peptide, HOMA) were similar between amlodipine and doxazosin groups. There was no difference in age, gender and body mass index among study groups. The follow-up time was 12 weeks. Patients with CRF had higher HOMA (1.83 +/- 0.55 vs 1.00 +/- 0.36, p = 0.001), fasting insulin (8.06 +/- 1.98 vs 4.46 +/- 1.31 IU/l, p < 0.001) and serum triglyceride levels (197 +/- 136 vs 112 +/- 67 mg/dl, p = 0.04) as compared to controls. Serum HDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in patients with CRF than controls (40 +/- 10 vs 57 +/- 14 mg/dl, p = 0.02). HOMA significantly decreased after doxazosin (1.91 +/- 0.45 vs 1.41 +/- 0.21, p = 0.02), however, no difference was found after amlodipine. Also, fasting insulin levels were decreased after a 12-week doxazosin therapy from 8.17 +/- 1.22 vs 6.58 +/- 0.84 IU/l, p = 0.02), but no change was seen after amlodipine. Lipid parameters did not significantly change during the study period in 2 groups. No adverse effect requiring drug discontinuation was observed during the 12-week period in the study groups. In conclusion, doxazosin decreases IR in patients with CRF, whereas amlodipine has no effect. This may be of advantage in the treatment of hypertension in this group of patients for preventing some long-term complication of IR.",4,E

Bedtime GRD 360 mg was associated with a significantly greater reduction in mean DBP between 6 AM and 12 noon compared to morning GRD 360 mg with a least squares mean for treatment difference of -3.3 mm Hg (P =.0004). Similar dose-related and significant reductions in systolic BP (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were obtained. Incidence of adverse events (AEs) for all GRD groups (44.5%) was less than that obtained for the placebo group (49.3%). The 540-mg group showed an incidence of AEs (43.5%) similar to that observed for the 240-mg group (42.6%).; The GRD dose-dependently significantly reduces BP and HR over the 24-h interval after once-daily bedtime dosing.

The objective of the present sub-study was to compare self-measured home blood pressure with office blood pressure at a time-point in the study when the patients' blood pressures had been treated to the level that the investigators conceived to be the blood pressure target. The NORDIL study was prospective, randomized, open and endpoint-blinded. It enrolled 10881 patients aged 50-74 years at health centers in Norway and Sweden who had diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 100 mmHg or more. The present sub-study group (n = 87) was small but fairly representative for the entire study population regarding baseline characteristics. Both systolic (4.0 mmHg, p = 0.01) and diastolic blood pressures (3.1 mmHg, p < 0.001) were significantly lower at home than in the office. Pearson correlation coefficients between the respective office and home readings were statistically highly significant (p < 0.001), but of moderate strength ranging from r = 0.41 for heart rate to r = 0.46 and r = 0.58 for diastolic and systolic blood pressures, respectively. Altman plots also gave statistical support to some inconsistency between the two methods of measurements. Pearson correlation coefficients between afternoon and morning measurements showed strong relationships with r-values >0.9 for both blood pressures and heart rate. The Altman plots also suggested excellent consistency between afternoon and morning measurements. Thus, motivated and trained hypertensive patients can perform home recordings of blood pressure and heart rate with precision; however, there are differences between recordings at home and in the investigators' offices that suggest some degree of ""white coat effect"" in these treated hypertensives.",2,E

It is less clear that drug-induced QTc prolongation gives rise to similar risks but data are emerging, linking antipsychotic use to increased cardiac mortality. Many antipsychotics have been clearly associated with QTc prolongation. Methodological considerations arguably preclude assuming that any antipsychotic is free of the risk of QTc prolongation and dysrhythmia.; Available data do not allow assessment of relative or absolute risk of dysrhythmia or sudden death engendered by antipsychotics but caution is advised. Risk of dysrhythmia can very probably be reduced by careful prescribing of antipsychotics in low doses in simple drug regimens which avoid metabolic interactions.

Changes in coronary diameter were measured by quantitative angiography. Endothelium-independent responses were assessed by intracoronary adenosine (1.2 mg/mL) and nitroglycerin (250 microg). Thereafter, patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to placebo, cerivastatin 0.4 mg/d, nifedipine 30 to 60 mg/d, or their combination. Studies were repeated at 6 months.

The second aim of the study was to assess whether chronic antihypertensive treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine would normalize these alterations. To test this hypothesis, we measured plasma concentrations of active MMP-2 and MMP-9 in 42 patients with never-treated essential hypertension and in 25 normotensive control subjects. Measurements were repeated after 6 months of treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Baseline values of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were decreased (P=0.01 and 0.002, respectively) in hypertensive patients compared with normotensives. Hypertensive patients with systemic vascular resistances <1440 dyn s/cm(5) exhibited higher values of MMP-2 (P=0.005) and MMP-9 (P=0.001) than hypertensive patients with systemic vascular resistances >1440 dyn s/cm(5). Treated patients attained a nonsignificant increase in MMP-2 plasma concentrations, but a significant increase in MMP-9 plasma concentrations (P=0.01) compared to respective values before treatment. In conclusion, these findings suggest that plasma concentrations of active MMP-2 and MMP-9, mainly related to vascular extracellular matrix metabolism, are depressed in patients with essential hypertension. A 6 month treatment with amlodipine can normalize MMP-9 but not MMP-2 plasma concentrations. The hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment may modulate collagen metabolism remains to be determined by further studies.",2,E

Where there are no contraindications to their use, tocolytics can improve neonatal survival rates by approximately 3% per day between 23 and 27 weeks gestation with a concomitant reduction in morbidity. The ultimate aim of tocolytic therapy is to prolong pregnancy until growth and maturation is complete, but even short-term delay may enable the administration of antepartum glucocorticoids to reduce hyaline membrane disease or to arrange transfer to a center with neonatal intensive care facilities. Both of these have been shown to reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity. Until recently, none of the currently used tocolytics, whether licensed or unlicensed, were developed specifically for the inhibition of preterm labor and consequently, they exhibit various potentially serious side-effects. As a result of the recent licensing of the oxytocin antagonist, atosiban, developed for the treatment of preterm labor and due to its high utero-specificity, obstetricians have experienced an advance in their options for the management of spontaneous preterm labor.",4,E

These include drug metabolism mediated by a select group of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2) and drug transporters (P-glycoprotein). Adverse drug interactions can result from induction (loss of therapeutic benefit) or inhibition (increased toxicity from excessive effect) of drug elimination. CYPs and P-glycoprotein are discussed individually with regards to their characteristics, frequently prescribed drug substrates, inducers and inhibitors, and important adverse drug events. The potential for important drug interactions can be predicted based on the properties of the causative agent (oral bioavailability, mechanism of elimination, seriousness of adverse event) and the interacting agent. Consequently, drug interactions can be prevented by avoiding concomitant administration of interacting substances or possibly implementing alternative therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, susceptibility to adverse events depends not only on the interacting substances, but also on the patient and the method of drug administration. Commonly prescribed drugs that are unlikely to cause a drug interaction involving CYPs or P-glycoprotein are also discussed.",5,E

Concepts of the mechanisms underlying venom action, as can be explained by the recently discovered effects on ionic channels, are discussed. A protocol for the treatment of scorpion stings based mainly on antivenom therapy was applied nationwide in Saudi Arabia. A list of drugs with alternatives was specified to be used in adjunctive therapy, when required. Analysis of the outcome from 1,033 cases at Al-Baha region, 791 cases at Al-Qassim region and more than 2,000 cases from 12 central and specialist hospitals in the Central Province, Saudi Arabia gave impressive results. The incidence of severe venom toxicity following antivenom administration was almost negligible. The period of stay in the hospital was reduced. The early reaction to antivenom administration was lower than expected the severity of the reaction consisting mainly of skin rashes, urticaria, wheezing and bronchial hypersensitivity, but no anaphylaxis. About 13.8% of the victims had been previously treated with antivenom but only 1.7% of the patients showed positive skin tests. This might be due to the low protein content of the antivenom and the action of the venom in releasing massive amounts of catecholamines.",4,E

Participants had to be 55 to 80 years of age, with hypertension (> or =150/95 or > or =160 mm Hg) and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Patients received 30 mg nifedipine once daily or co-amilozide (25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 2.5 mg amiloride) daily. Doses were doubled if target blood pressures (<140/90 mm Hg) were not achieved. Primary (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke) and secondary outcomes (composite of primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality and death from vascular and nonvascular causes) were assessed by means of intent-to-treat analyses. There was no significant difference in the incidence of primary outcomes between nifedipine-treated and co-amilozide-treated patients with diabetes at baseline (n=1302) (8.3% versus 8.4%; relative risk, 0.99, 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.42; P=1.00). A significant benefit for nifedipine-treated patients was seen for the composite secondary outcome (14.2% versus 18.7%; relative risk, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.97; P=0.03). Among patients without diabetes at baseline (n=5019), there was a significant difference in the incidence of new diabetes (nifedipine 4.3% versus co-amilozide 5.6%, P=0.023). Nifedipine GITS once daily is as effective as diuretic therapy in reducing cardiovascular complications in hypertensive diabetics. Nifedipine-treated patients were also less likely to have diabetes or have secondary events (a composite of all-cause mortality, death from a vascular cause, and death from a nonvascular cause) than co-amilozide recipients. Our results suggest that nifedipine could be considered as first-line therapy for hypertensive diabetics.",I,I

Data on whether this is common to all compounds and similar in the various phases of treatment are not univocal, however. In 28 untreated essential hypertensives (age, 56.4+/-1.8 years; mean+/-SEM) finger blood pressure (BP, Finapres), heart rate (HR, ECG), plasma norepinephrine (NE, high-performance liquid chromatography), and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA, microneurography) were measured at rest and during baroreceptor manipulation (vasoactive drugs) in the placebo run-in period and after randomization to double-blind acute and chronic (8 weeks) felodipine (10 mg/d, n=14) or lercanidipine (10 mg/d, n=14). Acute administration of both drugs induced pronounced BP reductions and marked increases in HR, NE, and MSNA. After 8 weeks of treatment, BP reductions were similar to those observed after acute administration, whereas HR, NE, and MSNA responses were markedly attenuated (-7%, -32%, and -14%, respectively; P<0.05). There was a small residual increase in sympathetic activity in the felodipine group, whereas in the lercanidipine group, all adrenergic markers returned to baseline values. Baroreflex control of HR and MSNA was markedly impaired (-42% and -48%, respectively) after acute drug administration, with a recovery and complete resetting during chronic treatment. Thus, the sympathoexcitation induced by 2 different dihydropyridines is largely limited to the acute administration. The 2 drugs have, nevertheless, a different chronic sympathetic effect, indicating that dihydropyridines do not homogeneously affect this function. The acute sympathoexcitation, but not the small between-drugs differential chronic adrenergic effect, is accounted for by baroreflex impairment.",2,E

A total of 32 mild to moderate essential hypertensives (DBP>90 and <110 mmHg), aged 30-70 years were studied. After a 4-week placebo period, they were randomized to amlodipine 5 mg o.d. or benazepril 10 mg o.d. or amlodipine 5 mg plus benazepril 10 mg o.d. for 4 weeks, according to a crossover design. At the end of the placebo period and of each active treatment period, blood pressure,AFV and PSTP were evaluated. AFV was measured using the principle of water displacement. PSTP was assessed using a system, the subcutaneous pretibial interstitial environment with a water manometer. Both amlodipine and benazepril monotherapy significantly reduced SBP (-18.2+/-4 and -17.8+/-4 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01 vs baseline) and DBP (-12.1+/-3 and -11.7+/-3 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01); the reduction was increased by the combination (-24.2+/-5 mmHg for SBP, P<0.001 and -16.8+/-4 mmHg for DBP, P<0.001). Amlodipine monotherapy significantly increased both AFV (+17.1%, P<0.001 vs baseline) and PSTP (+56.6%, P<0.001 vs baseline). As compared to amlodipine alone, the combination produced a less pronounced increase in AFV (+5.5%, P<0.05 vs baseline and P<0.01 vs amlodipine) and PSTP (+20.5%, P<0.05 vs baseline and P<0.01 vs amlodipine). Ankle oedema was clinically evident in 11 patients with amlodipine monotherapy and in three patients with the combination.

The CT scan showed a stenosis of the left renal artery, which was pushed against the aorta by the left crus of the diaphragm. An angioplasty with placement of an autoexpansible stent was carried out with a good result on the arterial pressure level. After 3 years, the patient was re-hospitalised with severe hypertension. The CT scan demonstrated a compression of the stent by the left crus of the diaphragm, with good permeability of the artery downstream from the stent, and radiographic examination showed a fracture of the left renal artery stent. Thus, a reimplantation of the left renal artery in the aorta was carried out. Stenosis of the renal artery by fibres from a crus of the diaphragm is a rare cause of renovascular hypertension. Helicoidal angioscanner imaging is particularly useful to do the diagnosis. In the present case, renal angioplasty with stenting was complicated by a fracture of the stent that led to the surgery. Thus, when renal artery stenosis by a crus of the diaphragm is diagnosed, surgical treatment needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis in relation to the anatomy and the biological and functional data.",5,E

Palpitations are frequently reported, but are usually found to be associated with sinus tachycardia. The incidence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia is increased during pregnancy, whereas atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are rarely seen. Women with long QT syndrome experience significantly more cardiac events in the postpartum period, making beta-blocker therapy most important during this time. Acute treatment of arrhythmias for pregnant women is much the same as that for nonpregnant patients. However, chronic drug therapy during pregnancy should be reserved for only the frequent, hemodynamically significant arrhythmia episodes.",5,E

Treatment in stroke units is the only treatment option proven to reduce death in acute stroke patients. Stroke unit care is also the only treatment which has shown a marked reduction in disability for general stroke patients, and also the only treatment with beneficial long-term effects on survival, disability and quality of life. Most acute hospitals in Norway have established stroke units. The recommended stroke unit model is a non-intensive combined unit able to focus simultaneously both on acute care and rehabilitation. This model has been very well evaluated in randomised trials and has achieved some of the best results regarding acute stroke care. Hence one can probably conclude that stroke unit care in Norway is evidence based.",5,E

We performed this study to test the hypothesis that this could be attributed to sympathetic overactivity. Thirty neurosurgical patients were included in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study comparing esmolol, a short-acting beta-blocker, and a placebo. Esmolol (0.3 mg. kg(-1). min(-1)) was infused from the end of anesthesia to 15 min after extubation. Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded before anesthesia, during anesthesia after surgery, at extubation, and 5-60 min after extubation. Cardiac output (COe) was estimated by using an esophageal Doppler from anesthesia to 60 min after extubation. CBFV, COe, and heart rate were significantly lower in the esmolol group. Mean arterial blood pressure was comparable between the groups. There was no correlation between CBFV and COe at any time point during the study. In conclusion, esmolol blunted the CBFV increase during emergence, confirming that sympathetic overactivity contributes to cerebral hyperemia during neurosurgical recovery.; Esmolol blunted the postoperative increase in cerebral blood flow velocity in neurosurgical patients. The origin of sympathetic hyperactivity and its potential deleterious consequences require further study.",3,E

The increase in treatment costs was partly but not fully offset by a nonsignificant reduction in the cost of CV hospitalizations. For patients with diabetes there were no significant differences in total cost between the target groups. The cost of avoiding a major CV event was negative in the base case analysis, SEK -10 360 (CI: -78 195, 75 630), and SEK 18 450 (CI: -88 789, 192 980) in a sensitivity analysis. For patients on ASA, costs were slightly but significantly higher than for patients on placebo. The estimates of the cost of avoiding a major CV event varied between SEK 41 600 and SEK 477 400, with very wide confidence intervals.; The treatment cost increases as the target for hypertension treatment is lowered. In patients with diabetes, intensive treatment to a lower target is cost-effective. Because of the nonsignificant difference in events, no conclusion can be made for all patients in the study. Furthermore, no conclusive evidence was found regarding the cost-effectiveness of adding ASA to the treatment of hypertension.",3,E

To assess its usefulness in older patients with systolic hypertension and widened pulse pressure, we compared the effects of eplerenone with amlodipine, on clinic blood pressure (BP) and pulse pressure and in a subset of the patients, ambulatory BP, vascular compliance, and urinary albumin excretion. The study involved 269 patients > or =50 years of age who were randomly assigned to either eplerenone (50 to 200 mg daily) or amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg daily) in a double-blind titration to effect design. After 24 weeks of therapy, reductions in clinic systolic BP were similar for both treatments (eplerenone, -20.5+/-1.1 mm Hg; amlodipine, -20.1+/-1.1 mm Hg). Reductions in clinic diastolic BP were modestly larger on amlodipine (-6.9+/-0.7 mm Hg) compared with eplerenone (-4.5+/-0.7 mm Hg) (P=0.014). Pulse pressure was also reduced similarly from baseline by the 2 treatment groups (eplerenone, -15.9 mm Hg versus amlodipine, -13.4 mm Hg, P=0.07). Changes from baseline in pulse wave velocity after 24 weeks of therapy were statistically similar for eplerenone and amlodipine. In patients with microalbuminuria at baseline (>30 mg albumin/g creatinine), eplerenone reduced the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio by 52% compared with a reduction of 10% by amlodipine (P=0.04). Thus, eplerenone was as effective as amlodipine in lowering systolic BP and pulse pressure as well as pulse wave velocity in older patients with widened pulse pressure hypertension. Furthermore, eplerenone reduced microalbuminuria to a greater extent than amlodipine in this older patient group.",2,E

Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that are used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure in HD patients have been suggested to contribute to anaemia as well by inhibiting erythropoiesis. Our purpose in this study is to investigate whether or not losartan, an angiotensin II (ATII) receptor antagonist, is causing rHuEPO resistance.; In this prospective study of 12 months, we compared the effects of high dose losartan (100 mg/day) and amlodipine (10 mg/day) on rHuEPO requirement in 40 hypertensive patients receiving rHuEPO for more than 12 months on maintenance HD. Twenty normotensive rHuEPO dependent patients served as control group. Iron deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, aluminium intoxication, infections and inflammations were excluded in all patients.; The mean haemoglobin level was found >8 g/dl in all groups. The mean weekly rHuEPO dose increased in the losartan group (p<0.0001 vs before) and remained constant in the other groups. No significant differences were found with PTH, iron status, aetiologies of renal failure in all groups.; High-dose losartan increases rHuEPO requirement and should be reserved for dialysis patients with hypertension uncontrollable with other antihypertensive medications.",4,E

Nicardipine and clonidine were compared with placebo in a double-blind, randomized, three-way cross-over controlled study after a 2-week placebo run-in period. This was a phase II clinical study carried out on out-patients in a single research centre. Fifteen elderly (63 +/- 10 years) hypertensive patients, without dementia but with memory complaints, were included. Psychomotor performance and cognition were assessed using both an extensive battery of validated psychometric tests (which evaluated attention and vigilance, body sway and memory) and an EEG profile. Cardiovascular parameters measured were blood pressure and heart rate. No detrimental effects of nicardipine were found on attention, vigilance, body sway or memory. Nicardipine produced a significant increase in alpha EEG energies, which may indicate possible alerting effects. In contrast, clonidine induced well-known deleterious sedative effects in psychometric tests and in EEG analysis (decrease in alpha and increase in delta and theta waves). The two drugs produced equivalent decreases in blood pressure at steady state. In conclusion, clonidine induced well-known sedative effects, while nicardipine did not impair central nervous system activity and may have had some short-term alerting effects in elderly hypertensive patients with memory complaints. This study supports the hypothesis of a dissociation between blood pressure and direct drug effects on the central nervous system.",5,E

Patients (n = 133) aged > or = 60 years, with ISH were randomized to receive either amlodipine 5 mg/day, or nicardipine 60 mg/day (titrated if necessary to 10 mg/day and 100 mg/day, respectively) for 90 days. Efficacy was assessed by measuring office blood pressure (BP), and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The two treatments substantially and comparably reduced office systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP), and also produced a slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Amlodipine reduced SBP, as assessed by ABPM, to a significantly greater extent than nicardipine. Both treatments were well-tolerated. The sustained effect of amlodipine, compared with nicardipine, was reflected in its significantly greater antihypertensive activity, particularly during the nocturnal period, as assessed by ABPM. The study demonstrates that once a day dose of amlodipine is an effective antihypertensive treatment for elderly ISH patients.",2,E

We conducted a retrospective case control study with inclusion criterion of a heart rate (HR) less than 80 bpm during the 1st week after transplantation. Control patients were matched for gender, age and time since transplantation. We identified 34 patients as having perioperative bradycardia out of the 174 who underwent cardiac transplantation between 1994 and 1997. The results demonstrated no significant differences in donor ischemic times (180 vs. 183, p = 0.88), operative surgeon (p = 0.62) or pretransplant cardiac disease (p = 0.81) between groups. Bradycardic patients were more likely to be on pretransplant amiodarone (RR = 20.4, p < 0.001). Perioperative bradycardia did not lead to increases in cellular rejection (p = 0.72) or vasculopathy (p = 0.79). The patients prescribed pretransplant amiodarone (n = 14) had a trend toward delayed time to first rejection episode (31.0 vs. 15.5 days, median, p = 0.07). In conclusion, perioperative bradycardia does not increase adverse outcomes after cardiac transplantation and is associated with pretransplant use of amiodarone. Amiodarone may modify the recipients' immune response by delaying the occurrence of rejection.",3,E

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis represents only a stage within the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and is defined pathologically by the presence of steatosis together with necro-inflammatory activity. The true prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is unknown, but it is estimated that it affects 10-24% of the general population in different countries. The diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is based upon convincing evidence of absent or minimal alcohol consumption, compatible histological changes in liver biopsy and the exclusion of other liver diseases. The natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease remains to be defined. Patients with pure steatosis on liver biopsy follow a relatively benign course, whereas patients with histological necro-inflammatory changes and/or fibrosis may progress to end-stage liver disease. An initial step in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the management of associated conditions, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients with steatohepatitis and/or fibrosis on liver biopsy may benefit from investigational pharmacological therapy. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may be candidates for liver transplantation.",2,E

Although the odds for a given patient for developing arrhythmias are small, the number of patients receiving such drugs is enormous. Most patients developing proarrhythmia have additional risk factors that could be easily identified from their medical history. The list of risk factors includes female gender, organic heart disease, hypokalemia, and a history of long QT or drug-induced arrhythmias. Patients without risk factors are at very low risk. For these patients, it is neither practical nor necessary to record an electrocardiogram before therapy is initiated and the most important preventive measure is to avoid concurrent administration of 2 or more drugs that prolong the QT interval or administration of a medication that impairs the metabolism of a QT-prolonging drug. We performed a computerized literature search using the key words ""long QT,"" ""torsade,"" ""drug-adverse effects,"" and ""drug-ventricular arrhythmias,"" searching for published reports of drug-induced torsade de pointes.

Hypertension, heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders are prevalent conditions among this age group. Consequently, clinicians will spend a large proportion of their practices managing older adults with cardiovascular disorders. A large proportion of this time will be devoted to using pharmacotherapeutic strategies for the long-term management of chronic conditions. The physiological changes that accompany aging affect cardiovascular function, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many cardiovascular medications are altered by these physiological changes. The interactions of these changes can have a profound effect on the agents used to treat cardiovascular disorders and may alter their therapeutic outcomes. Several classes of medications are used to treat chronic cardiovascular disorders in older adults. These include the ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), oral antiarrhythmic agents and warfarin. Drugs such as beta-blockers may aggravate decreased cardiac output and increase peripheral resistance, but are valuable adjuncts in many patients with congestive heart failure. Agents that reduce angiotensin II activity may have several benefits for treating heart failure and hypertension. Successful treatment of cardiovascular disorders in older adults requires the choice of the most appropriate agent, taking into consideration the complex interactions of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and disease effects.",5,E

The findings were compared with that of a previous study conducted in the same tertiary hospital 10 years earlier. A cross-sectional evaluation of blood pressure (BP) control in a hypertension clinic was undertaken among 150 Nigerian patients aged 61 +/- 12 years (55% females), with a duration of treatment on a particular drug class or combination of 9 +/- 3 months. The initial blood pressure was 176 +/- 20/108 +/- 11 mmHg and 22% of the patient had concurrent diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics (D) alone or in combination remained the most commonly prescribed drugs in 56% of all patients. There were significant increases in the prescriptions of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (51%), P < 0.0001, and ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) (24%), P < 0.0001, but a slight reduction in the use of methyldopa, and fixed drug combinations (P < 0.01) compared to the previous study. The fall in systolic blood pressure on D (r = 0.65, P < 0.001) or CCB (r = 0.48, P < 0.02) was significantly correlated with the initial systolic blood pressure, but not age. More patients achieved normotension BP < 140/90 mmHg on CCB monotherapy (71%), than D monotherapy (56%). Combination therapy with ACEIs + D or methyldopa+thiazides normalized BP in 63 and 68%, respectively. Pulse pressure, a surrogate marker for cardiovascular complications and mortality in essential hypertension, was significantly reduced (P < 0.01) equally by all treatments, with 95% confidence intervals ranging from -28 to -1 mmHg. However, hypertensive-diabetic (HT-DM) patients (n = 33) exhibited no significant change in pulse pressure in response to treatment. Adverse drug reactions that occurred in 11% were impotence or postural dizziness with D, headache and pitting oedema with CCB, and dry cough with ACEI. Pharmaco-economic comparison of the drug classes revealed that for every US dollar (dollar) spent per month, the percentage of treated patients attaining normotension was 18.6 for D, 4.73 for CCB, 3.5 for ACEI + D and 13.6 for methyldopa + thiazides. A combination of ACEI + CCB or D was the preferred treatment for hypertensive-diabetic Nigerians, but only 24% attained a BP < 130/85 mmHg. These results demonstrate a shift in trend to a more rational and efficacious treatment of hypertension over a 10 year period. This may be associated, at least in part, with the intensive and continuous education of the prescribers in rational drug use and the introduction of a hospital formulary. Methyldopa is still a highly efficacious and cost-effective drug in this population. Black HT-DM Africans still constitute a subgroup who not only require more and costlier antihypertensive drugs, but whose BP control is suboptimal, and exhibit a poor therapeutic response to other risk factors (pulse pressure) that constitute a continuing risk for cardiovascular mortality.",6,E

If necessary, hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) was added to each compound. We evaluated brachial artery flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation (high-resolution ultrasound) compared with endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate (25 microg/s). Brachial artery diameter was measured by automatic computerized analysis. Forty healthy subjects were evaluated as a control group. Oxidative stress production was evaluated by measuring plasma malondialdehyde and plasma lipoperoxides; plasma antioxidant capacity was assessed as ferric-reducing antioxidant power. Hypertensive patients showed a significantly (P<0.01) lower flow-mediated dilation (5.2+/-1.9%) as compared with healthy control subjects (7.1+/-2.6%). Response to glyceryl trinitrate was similar in control subjects and patients. At baseline, blood pressure, diameter, flow-mediated dilation, and response to glyceryl trinitrate were similar in the different treatment groups. All treatments similarly reduced blood pressure, but only perindopril increased flow mediated dilation (from 5.1+/-2 to 6.4+/-2.4%; P<0.01) without modifying the response to glyceryl trinitrate. Perindopril but also telmisartan nifedipine and amlodipine reduced oxidative stress and increased plasma antioxidant capacity.

12740004,ACE inhibitors versus diuretics: ALLHAT versus ANBP2.,NA,"Doggrell, Sheila A","The ALLHAT (The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial) trial enrolled hypertensive patients with at least one additional risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) to a comparison of the diuretic chlorthalidone, the calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril. Throughout the study, chlorthalidone decreased the systolic blood pressure to a slightly, but significantly greater extent (0.8-3.1 mmHg) than amlodipine or lisinopril. No significance differences were reported for amlodipine versus chlorthalidone or lisinopril versus chlorthalidone on the primary outcome of combined incidence of fatal CHD and nonfatal myocardial infarction. The findings of ALLHAT support the use of thiazide-type diuretics as first choice pharmacological therapy in at risk patients with hypertension. ANBP2 (The Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study) was also a comparison between diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide) and ACE inhibitors (enalapril) but was performed in older hypertensives that had few previous cardiovascular events. Diastolic blood pressure reduction was similar in both groups at all times. The risk of the primary outcome of all cardiovascular events or death from any cause was 11% lower in the ACE group than the diuretic group and the benefit was predominantly in men. Thus, ANBP2 suggests that in relatively healthy elderly hypertensive patients, ACE inhibitors should be preferred to diuretics.",5,E

We compared the effect of a combination therapy with a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker plus an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a beta blocker plus a diuretic on hemoglobin A(1c) (Hb A(1c)) in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild-to- moderate hypertension.; A total of 463 hypertensive outpatients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes on stable antidiabetic therapy for at least 3 months and with HbA(1c) between 6.5% and 10% were recruited. In a randomized, double blind trial patients were treated for 20 weeks with fixed combinations of verapamil sustained release (SR) plus trandolapril and of atenolol plus chlorthalidone following a 2-week placebo run-in period. The main outcome measures were HbA(1c), fasting plasma glucose, and fructosamine levels as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure.; HbA(1c) remained stable at 7.9% after administration of verapamil SR plus trandolapril and increased from 7.8% to 8.6% with atenolol plus chlorthalidone; the differences between treatment groups were significant at 4, 12, and 20 weeks of treatment and at last visit (P <.0001).

Serum creatinine was measured as part of the diagnostic workup of 2398 consecutive admissions to an acute medical receiving unit in a district general hospital. Outcome measures were the presence of diarrhoea and/or vomiting, and whether taking an ACE inhibitor, NSAID or diuretic at the time of admission, also previous, initial and follow up serum creatinine concentrations. Peak serum creatinine in the 3 cases was 1159, 989 and 765 micromol/l. None of the 3 required dialysis and all recovered renal function completely after receiving large volumes of intravenous fluid. In the cohort study, 89 of 2398(3.7%) admissions had serum creatinine >/=200 micromol/l. Nine were regular dialysis patients. Of the remaining patients, 30 (37.5%) were taking an ACE inhibitor. Six of 30 (20%) gave a history of diarrhoea and/or vomiting. Median creatinine concentration in this group was 135 (range 111-209) micromol/l before admission, 292 (216-724) micromol/l when first seen in hospital, and 134 (94-219) micromol/l following the withdrawal of drug therapy and fluid replacement. In conclusion, volume depletion causing acute renal failure in patients taking ACE inhibitors is not uncommon. Such patients and their general practitioners should be aware that reversible renal impairment may occur during intercurrent illnesses, particularly if characterised by diarrhoea and/or vomiting.",3,E

This randomized, double-blind study compared the antihypertensive efficacy of the starting dose of olmesartan medoxomil with that of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate (amlodipine) in subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, 440 subjects aged >/=18 years were randomized to the starting dose of olmesartan medoxomil (20 mg/day), amlodipine (5 mg/day), or placebo for 8 weeks. Subjects were evaluated by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and by seated cuff blood pressure (BP) measurements at trough. The primary end point was the change from baseline in mean 24-h diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by ABPM at Week 8. Secondary end points included change from baseline in mean 24-h ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 8 weeks, change from baseline in mean seated trough cuff DBP and SBP measurements, and response and control rates for DBP <90 and <85 mmHg. Control rates for SBP <140 and <130 mmHg were also calculated. Olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine produced significantly greater reductions in ambulatory and seated DBP and SBP compared with placebo. Mean reductions in ambulatory and seated BP were similar between the two active agents; however, in the olmesartan medoxomil group, significantly more patients achieved the SBP goal of <130 mmHg and the DBP goal of <85 mmHg. Both drugs were well tolerated at the recommended starting dose. Although amlodipine was associated with a higher incidence of oedema, this did not reach statistical significance. Olmesartan medoxomil is an effective antihypertensive agent, with BP-lowering efficacy at the starting dose similar to that of amlodipine, and is associated with more patients achieving the rigorous BP goals of SBP <130 mmHg and DBP <85 mmHg.",2,E

Patients being recruited were openly randomised to amlodipine or nifedipine retard. Ambulatory 24-h BP and echocardiogram (in 42 patients) were measured before and 1 year after treatment. At the end of study, there was 17% reduction in systolic BP; 17% reduction in diastolic BP and 12% reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (no difference between amlodipine and nifedipine). Of the 42 subjects underwent echocardiograms, eight became 'new-dippers' at the end of study (non-dippers before treatment and restored nocturnal fall of MAP> or =10% after treatment). The other 34 patients were either non-dippers before and after treatment (n=27); dippers before and after treatment (n=3) or dippers before treatment and non-dippers after treatment (n=4). The eight 'new-dippers' had improved ejection fraction (69.6+/-7.2 to 75.8+/-7.4%, P<0.05) and increased left ventricular diastolic diameter (43.7+/-7.9 to 47.9+/-8.8 mm, P<0.05) after the 1-year treatment of calcium antagonist. Compared to the other 34 subjects, the eight 'new-dippers' showed significant improvement in ejection fraction (9.4+/-10.9 vs. -1.2+/-11.8%, P<0.05). In conclusion, both amlodipine and nifedipine retard are effective in controlling the 24-h BP in Chinese hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. For those who have restored nocturnal dip in BP have significantly increased left ventricular systolic ejection fraction after 1-year treatment of long acting calcium antagonists.

In 53% of these cases, low concentrations of some common benzodiazepines were present. The median postmortem blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 3.3 percent per thousand (w/w) in the 615 alcohol poisonings, but significantly lower, ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 percent per thousand, when promazine, doxepin, amitriptyline or propoxyphene were found together with alcohol. When levomepromazine, temazepam or zopiclone were present, the median BAC was also significantly lower, 2.5-2.7 percent per thousand. Citalopram and diltiazem did not exhibit a significant effect. The median BAC was significantly lower in cases with high concentrations than in those with low concentrations of a drug (excluding citalopram), suggesting a positive concentration-effect relationship. Fatal toxicity indices (FTIs) were calculated by relating the number of deaths caused by a drug to the corresponding sales figures. Promazine had an extremely high FTI, followed by levomepromazine, propoxyphene, doxepin and amitriptyline. The other drugs had relatively low FTIs. The results reflect not only the acute toxicity of a given drug-alcohol combination but also the manners of use and abuse of these drugs.",6,E

Therefore, the authors studied the biological indicators of thrombogenesis and sympathetic activity. The study was conducted on 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome and 30 patients with stable angina pectoris. Treatment was standardized with low-molecular-weight heparin and 300 mg aspirin/day but with no IIb/IIIa inhibitors, an oral beta-blocker, diltiazem 60 mg tid, glyceryl trinitrate i.v. in patients with ACS but with mononitrates orally and low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with stable angina. Twenty-four-hour continuous ECG monitoring and ST segment analysis were performed on day 2 of admission and heart rate analysis was performed 10, 5, and 1 minute before and during the myocardial ischemia periods. Blood sampling for von Willebrand factor (vWf) determination was performed through a peripheral vein at 8 AM, noon, 6 PM and 10 PM and half an hour after the description of angina. The patients with ACS were grouped as transient myocardial ischemia positive (n = 20) and negative (n = 30). The patients with stable angina were designated as the control group (n = 30). The detected vWf levels at 4 different daytime periods in patients with ACS were significantly higher than those in patients with stable angina. At the 6 PM to 10 PM period, the vWf level increase was significantly higher in patients with TMI than in the patients without TMI. At the 8 AM to noon period, the detected vWf levels decreased significantly in both TMI groups. During the nocturnal ischemia periods, the increase in vWf levels immediately after angina was significantly more apparent than the detected changes during daytime ischemia. Analysis showed that heart rates before the ischemia during stable angina episodes were significantly higher than those in TMI (-) (silent) angina. The heart rate difference between 10 minutes before and during the ischemia in the angina group was significantly different from that during TMI (-) (silent) ischemia. The heart rates at the times related to ischemia in the nocturnal period were significantly lower than those in the daytime period. The heart rate differences between the ischemia-related times and during the ischemia were significantly higher in daytime ischemic attacks than in nocturnal ischemic attacks. The study confirms that the vWf level, which is an indicator of thrombogenesis, was significantly increased in patients with ACS. Nocturnal ischemia is associated with thrombogenesis. Daytime ischemia is associated with increased sympathetic activity, and symptomatic ischemia is usually associated with increased sympathetic activity.",2,E

This is thought to improve anal mucosal blood flow and promote healing of the fissure. This study reports the use of topical diltiazem in patients with chronic anal fissures that have failed previous treatment with topical 0.2% glyceryl trinitrate (GTN).; Forty-seven patients with chronic anal fissure who had previously failed at least one course of topical GTN were recruited prospectively from a single centre. Patients were instructed to apply 2 cm (approximately 0.7 g) of 2% diltiazem cream to the anal verge twice daily for eight weeks. Symptoms of pain, bleeding and itching were recorded on a linear analogue score prior to starting the cream and then repeated at 2 weekly intervals. Patients were asked to report side-effects throughout the study period. Healing of the fissure was assessed after 8 weeks of treatment.; Forty-six patients completed treatment; of these, 22 had healed fissures (48%). Ten of the 24 patients with persistent fissures were symptomatically improved and wished no further treatment. Of the 14 patients who remained symptomatic, one was given a repeat course of 0.2% glyceryl trinitrate with subsequent healing of the fissure, 10 were recruited into an ongoing study involving injections of botulinum toxin into the internal anal sphincter and three were referred for surgery.; This study shows that topical 2% diltiazem is an effective and safe treatment for chronic anal fissure in patients who have failed topical 0.2% GTN.

12797102,Braxton-Hicks contractions can alter uteroplacental perfusion.,NA,"Bower, S; Campbell, S; Vyas, S; McGirr, C","Color flow imaging was used to study the effect of spontaneous low-amplitude uterine contractions (Braxton-Hicks) on flow velocity waveforms obtained from the main uterine artery in 13 women between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation. Eight women had abnormal waveforms, as defined by the presence of an early diastolic notch, and five women had normal waveforms. In the former group, three women with chronic hypertension were started on the calcium antagonist nifedipine during this study. Contractions, which were monitored by external tocography, occurred more frequently in the group with abnormal waveforms and were temporally associated with an increase in impedance to blood flow. This effect occurred to the same degree in both normal and abnormal groups, but in the abnormal group the already impaired blood flow to the intervillous space was further diminished, resulting in absence of forward flow in diastole. Such acute reductions of flow in response to frequent, impalpable uterine contractions may cause a prolonged and silent insult to uteroplacental perfusion, which could hasten fetal compromise. This effect appeared to be abolished in patients on nifedipine, suggesting a possible therapeutic role for this drug in uteroplacental insufficiency.",4,E

After adjustment for potential confounders, those in the lowest quintile of Hct (range 25.4% to 37.5%) had a 52% higher risk of death (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 2.10), compared with the highest quintile (range 46.1% to 58.8%). Within the lowest quintile of Hct, each 1% decrease in Hct was associated with an 11% higher risk of death (p < 0.01), whereas within the four higher quintiles of Hct, Hct was not associated with total mortality. Evaluation of different causes of death indicated that a lower Hct was strongly associated with death from progressive HF, rather than sudden death or other deaths.; Among patients with severe HF, anemia is a significant independent risk factor for death, with a progressively higher risk with increasing severity of anemia. Further investigation of the etiologies, prevention, and treatment of anemia in severe HF is warranted.",6,E

12801442,Optimal medical management of angina.,"Angina Pectoris; Humans; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Risk Factors","Noronha, Brian; Duncan, Edward; Byrne, Jonathan A","Coronary artery disease remains one of the principal causes of disability worldwide. Its most common manifestation is angina pectoris. Angina occurs due to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply; it is classically precipitated by physical activity, emotion, eating, or cold weather. It is defined as stable when its frequency, severity, duration, time of appearance, and precipitating factors remain unchanged for 60 days. Treatment of patients with stable angina targets a number of factors that underlie its pathophysiology: aspirin as an antiplatelet agent, b-blockade to reduce myocardial oxygen demand, and additional antianginal drugs when symptoms are incompletely controlled by b-blockers alone. Furthermore, aggressive treatment of risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease confers a significant mortality benefit. Unstable angina is defined as symptoms developing at rest, on minimal exertion, and of increasing severity, duration, or frequency. It is associated with significant mortality; consequently, early assessment and intervention is essential to prevent worsening ischemia. Treatment includes close in-patient monitoring, administration of antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs, and a combination of b-blockers, calcium antagonists, and intravenous nitrates where appropriate. Coronary revascularization should be considered in high-risk patients, and when conservative management strategies fail.",5,E

Classic treatment is surgical sphincterotomy to reduce the anal tone and eliminate sphincteric spasm. However, concerns have been raised about the incidence of fecal incontinence after surgery. Therefore, pharmacological means to treat chronic anal fissures have been explored.; We conducted a literature review on MEDLINE database.; All treatments address the anomaly of a high anal pressure. Several studies have investigated the effect of topical glyceryl trinitrate ointment. Healing rates range from 30% to 86%. Therapy is limited because of a high incidence of moderate to severe headaches in up to 84% of patients. Comparable results are observed after injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter (43-96%). Minor incontinence for flatus and soiling has been reported in up to 12% of patients. Further pharmacological approaches including treatment via calcium channel blockade and treatment with alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists are still at a developmental stage.; Topical glyceryl trinitrate ointment and injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter are advocated as the first-line treatment for chronic anal fissure. Lateral sphincterotomy should be offered to patients with relapse and therapeutic failure of prior pharmacological treatment.",4,E
12814338,Isotretinoin use and subsequent depression and suicide: presenting the evidence.,"Acne Vulgaris; Depression; Dermatologic Agents; Humans; Isotretinoin; Receptors, Retinoic Acid; Suicide","Hull, Peter R; D'Arcy, Carl","The growing number of reported cases of depression and suicide associated with isotretinoin (a retinoid receptor agonist) use in patients with acne has prompted concern among dermatologists, patients, and their relatives and has triggered new warnings from regulators including depression-related, patient-informed consent forms. In establishing a cause-effect relationship, it is useful to judiciously consider whether there is an association, what is the nature of that association, if there is a plausible biological mechanism of action, the validity and reliability of measures used and the strength of study designs. Hoffmann-La Roche estimates that by April 2001 approximately 12 million patients worldwide have used isotretinoin, with 5 million patients in the US.A MEDLINE search between January 1966 and May 14 2003 of the published medical literature found 24 documented cases of isotretinoin-associated depression, with 3 suicides. One additional patient committed suicide during the fourth month of isotretinoin treatment and 3 further patients attempted suicide by taking an overdose of isotretinoin. The US FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) contains almost 23,000 reports for isotretinoin from its approval in 1982 to December 2002. As of November 30, 2002, AERS contained 3,104 reports (US and foreign) with at least one reported psychiatric event. The FDA is aware of 173 reports of suicide (both US and foreign) in association with isotretinoin. Reports of positive dechallenge and rechallenge present a strong signal pointing to an association between isotretinoin and depression. A Hoffmann-La Roche sponsored epidemiological study failed to find any evidence of an association between isotretinoin and depression or suicide. However, the design of the study was flawed and the evidence was deemed inconclusive. Further studies using strong study designs, reliable and valid measures, and adequate sample sizes may bring us closer to the answer. The evidence suggesting a relationship between isotretinoin and depression needs to be weighed against the increasing prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults and the psychological impact of acne. The literature contains credible evidence that isotretinoin treatment may reduce the psychosocial impact of acne in some patients. At the present time, there is no known pharmacological mechanism that would account for psychiatric symptomatology as a result of isotretinoin treatment; however, retinoid receptors are widely distributed in the brain and more research is needed to ascertain whether they have a role in depression. In the meantime, for the practitioner, the obvious benefit of isotretinoin in treating acne should encourage continued use. However, patients and their relatives must be informed and depressive symptoms should be actively assessed at each visit and, if necessary, referral to a psychiatrist, antidepressant therapy or discontinuation of isotretinoin should be considered.",3,E

The current study tests the hypothesis that initial therapy with a fixed-dose combination will achieve the recommended blood pressure goal in patients with type 2 diabetes faster than conventional monotherapy. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study had as a primary end point achievement of blood pressure <130/85 mm Hg. Participants (N=214) with hypertension and type 2 diabetes received either amlodipine/benazepril 5/10 mg (combination) or enalapril 10 mg (conventional) once daily for 4 weeks, titrated to 5/20 mg/day or 20 mg/day, respectively at this time, if target blood pressure was not achieved. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg/day was added for the final 4 weeks, if target blood pressure was still not reached. Time from baseline to achieve blood pressure <130/85 mm Hg was shorter in the combination group (5.3+/-3.1 weeks combination vs. 6.4+/-3.8 weeks conventional; p=0.001). At 3 months, more participants in the combination group achieved treatment goal (63% combination vs. 37% conventional; p=0.002). Data analysis at 3 months comparing blood pressure control rates between the fixed-dose combination group (without HCTZ) to the conventional group (receiving HCTZ) showed an even greater disparity in blood pressure goal achievement (87% combination without HCTZ vs. 37% conventional group with HCTZ; p=0.0001). We conclude that initial therapy with a fixed-dose combination may be more efficacious than conventional monotherapy approaches for achieving blood pressure goals in the diabetic patient. A fixed-dose combination approach appears as safe as the current conventional approaches.",3,E

Both carotid arteries developed occlusive thrombosis in each of the five control animals (time to occlusion: right carotid artery, 92.6 minutes; left carotid artery, 89.0 minutes). A single oral dose of CRL42796 (3 mg/kg) prevented occlusive thrombosis in 4 of 6 vessels and increased time to thrombosis, albeit not significantly (right carotid artery, 134.1 minutes; left carotid artery, 145.0 minutes). When the initial dose of CRL42796 was followed by a second oral dose (3 mg/kg) 2 hours later, 10 of 10 carotid arteries remained patent throughout the period of electrolytic injury. CRL42796 reduced thrombus weight in both treatment protocols. Ex vivo platelet aggregation with arachidonic acid (AA) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was reduced at 120, 240, and 360 minutes after two doses of CRL42796. A single oral dose reduced ADP-induced responses at 240 and 360 minutes, but significant effects were not observed with AA. Bleeding time increased 360 minutes after two oral doses of CRL42796, but not at 120 minutes. Bleeding time was unchanged with the single dose of CRL42796. The results demonstrate that oral administration of CRL42796 prevents carotid artery thrombosis in response to deep vessel wall injury and may have potential value to be characterized in extended preclinical and clinical study.",2,E

The clinical periodontal parameters of pocket depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque control record (PCR) were measured around selected sample teeth. Gingival biopsies were further processed by immunohistochemical staining method. The expressions of cells positive for AR, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 were counted by predetermined semiquantitative methods.; Our results indicated that AR, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 were intensively expressed in the nuclei of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts of gingival connective tissue. Stronger expressions of AR, IL-2, and IFN-gamma were found in the NIGO group. The AR+ cells/0.01 mm2 in gingival fibroblasts were significantly higher in the NIGO group (80.2 +/- 10.7) than those of the periodontitis group (52.5 +/- 11.8) and control group (37.4 +/- 11.3) (P < 0.05). The cytokine expression of the NIGO group showed a trend towards Th1-type expression (IL-2; P = 0.0001). In the surgically extracted tooth group, a stronger expression of Th2-type cytokine (IL-4, Il-10, IL-13; P < 0.05) was found in inflammatory cells. In a comparison of the IL-2/IL-4-labeled cell ratio of the four groups, a descending sequence was discovered as NIGO group (0.92 +/- 0.97) > H group (0.81 +/- 0.61) > P group (0.77 +/- 0.82) > S group (0.58 +/- 1.77).; Our data support the following: (i) taking nifedipine may elevate the expression of AR in susceptible oral tissue, e.g. gingiva; (ii) the cytokine profile of T-cells in NIGO tissue indicates a trend preferentially towards Th1 activity; and (iii) elevation of AR expression cells and prominent Th1 cytokine-labeled cells are two significant factors in the pathogenesis of NIGO.",6,E

Because the beneficial effect of antihypertensive therapy seems to be linked to the degree of blood pressure reduction, guidelines recommend reducing blood pressure below 140/90mm Hg, with a lower target in patients who are young or who have diabetes mellitus (with or without nephropathy) or non-diabetic nephropathy. Blood pressure reduction can be achieved with several classes of drugs, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists and calcium channel antagonists. Calcium channel antagonists have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke and major cardiovascular events. However, it is still controversial whether different treatment regimens based on different drug classes can offer advantages beyond similar degrees of blood pressure control in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The International Nifedipine GITS Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) was a controlled clinical trial aimed at comparing the efficacy of a long-acting calcium channel antagonist, nifedipine gastrointestinal-transport-system (GITS), versus co-amilozide, a combination of the diuretics hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and amiloride, on morbidity and mortality in high-risk hypertensive patients. Nifedipine GITS and HCTZ/amiloride were equally effective at reducing blood pressure and the risk of primary outcomes (a composite of death from any cardiovascular or cerebrovascular cause, non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure). Results from other studies indicate that there may be greater benefits for stroke and smaller benefits for coronary artery disease with calcium channel antagonist-based regimens than with diuretic or beta-blocker-based regimens. However, there is at present insufficient evidence to recommend a specific drug choice based on patient risk profile. Thus, the choice of antihypertensive drug(s) should be according to efficacy and tolerability. In addition to the reductions in cardiovascular risk, two substudies of INSIGHT showed that nifedipine GITS was able to prevent the progression of intima media thickness in the common carotid artery and slow the progression of coronary calcification. The clinical significance of this effect in the prevention of cardiovascular events still remains to be established.",5,E

A body mass index in excess of 27 kg/m2 was required for entry. At study end, weight had changed from 75.4+/-9.6 to 70.0+/-9.5 kg in the sibutramine group and from 77.9+/-9.0 to 74.5+/-9.4 kg in the placebo group. In the sibutramine group, systolic blood pressure was 127.8+/-5.8 mm Hg after stabilization and 125.2+/-8.5 mm Hg after completion of the trial; respective values for diastolic blood pressure were 82.4+/-3.7 and 81.5+/-4.6 mm Hg.

ATP has been shown to be effective in terminating approximately 80% to 90% of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) episodes. Although ATP is routinely used, little is known about predictors of ATP failure. Based on the evaluation of stored electrograms, we aimed to prospectively follow patients with ICDs, and to analyze parameters affecting ATP effectiveness. One hundred eighteen consecutive patients received ICDs for standard indications. Before discharge, empirical, standardized ATP therapy was programmed in all patients within VT zones. A total of 1,218 spontaneous tachycardia episodes occurred in 51 patients during a mean follow-up of 24.5 +/- 12 months. Among these, 888 VTs were diagnosed. One hundred four fast VTs were detected in the ventricular fibrillation zone and treated with primary shock delivery. ATP was attempted 881 times in the remaining 784 VT episodes. ATP terminated 640 VTs successfully, ATP failed in 55 VTs finally reverted by shocks, and 89 VTs converted to a slower VT outside the VT zone. Fifty-one of these slower VTs reverted spontaneously, and 38 were redetected and treated. Finally, in primary intention-to-treat basis, ATP was successful in 691 VTs (88%) and unsuccessful in 93 VTs (12%). There was no influence of VT cycle length on ATP success rate. Furthermore, ATP efficacy was similar between patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35% or >35%, between daytime and nighttime, as well as between patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. A faster heart rate immediately preceding the onset of VT (103 +/- 19 vs 78 +/- 14 beats/min, respectively, hazard ratio 4.08, 95% confidence interval 2.11 to 7.89, p <0.001), and absence of beta-blocker therapy (82% vs 93%, respectively, hazard ratio 2.71, 95% confidence interval 1.72 to 4.29, p = 0.02) were found, by Cox proportional-hazard analysis, to be the sole independent predictors of ATP ineffectiveness in ICD recipients. Thus, the present study identified both preceding sinus tachycardia (reflecting an increased sympathetic tone) and lack of beta-blocker use as independent risk factors for reduced success of ATP therapy in terminating VT. Therefore, modification of sympathetic tone may be beneficial for patients with ICDs.",3,E

However, considering all the evidence available today, these drugs should be considered safe for the treatment of the uncomplicated hypertensive patient in combination with other drugs. They can also be used as first-line therapy for older, stroke-prone hypertensive patients. In addition, when a calcium channel blocker is indicated for better blood pressure control, its use should not be withheld for safety concerns.",5,E

Levosimendan acts via complementary mechanisms; it enhances contractility by sensitising cardiac myofilaments to calcium and dilates blood vessels by opening ATP-dependent potassium channels. In contrast to traditional inotropes (beta-agonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors), levosimendan does not raise myocyte calcium levels and is therefore less likely to elicit arrhythmias or to impair diastolic relaxation. The clinical efficacy of levosimendan is supported by four key clinical studies, including more than 900 patients hospitalised for cardiac decompensation due to acutely worsened chronic heart failure or to heart failure following myocardial infarction. When given as short-term therapy, levosimendan enhances cardiac output, reduces systemic vascular resistance and lowers pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 31 days post-treatment, mortality rates were halved in decompensated chronic heart failure patients who received levosimendan, compared with those on dobutamine--an advantage sustained at 180 days. Similar survival gains were observed among acute failure patients treated with levosimendan following myocardial infarction. With its substantial haemodynamic and survival benefits, levosimendan is well suited to be part of routine management for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure.",3,E

We have conducted a PubMed literature search to obtain an update on the etiology, diagnostic problems and therapeutic considerations of preterm delivery. Approximately 5-10% of all births are premature. Preterm labor is associated with preterm rupture of membranes, cervical incompetence, polyhydramnion, fetal and uterine anomalies, infections, social factors, stress, smoking, heavy work and other risk factors. The diagnosis is made on the patients presenting symptoms, clinical findings and of progressive effacement and dilatation of the cervix. Biochemical markers of preterm delivery are of minor importance in daily clinical work. Measurement of the cervix, however, is a practical and valuable tool to predict preterm delivery. Cervical cerclage can be useful in selected cases. Antibiotics may help to prevent preterm labor in cases of known etiologic agents (e.g. preterm rupture of membranes and urinary infection). The use of tocolytic agents such as beta-sympathetic receptor stimulators can be advocated for a few days. There is evidence that their long-term use is not beneficial and could even be harmful to the fetus. Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) and a new selective oxytocin receptor antagonist, atosiban, appear to be as effective as beta-sympathomimetic drugs on uterine contractions with fewer side-effects. Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors such as indomethacin may prevent uterine contractions and can be used prior to the 32nd week of pregnancy. A single course of corticosteroid treatment in two doses of 12 mg betamethasone or 6 mg of dexamethasone is important for the prevention of respiratory distress between the 24th and 34th weeks of pregnancy. Multiple doses may be harmful and should be avoided. In these cases management should depend on gestation age (fetal maturity). Uterine contractions after 34 weeks' gestation are not an indication for tocolytic treatment.",4,E

The development of mild hypertension or preeclampsia at or near term is associated with minimal maternal and neonatal morbidities. In contrast, the onset of severe gestational hypertension and/or severe preeclampsia before 35 weeks' gestation is associated with significant maternal and perinatal complications. Women with diagnosed gestational hypertension-preeclampsia require close evaluation of maternal and fetal conditions for the duration of pregnancy, and those with severe disease should be managed in-hospital. The decision between delivery and expectant management depends on fetal gestational age, fetal status, and severity of maternal condition at time of evaluation. Expectant management is possible in a select group of women with severe preeclampsia before 32 weeks' gestation. Steroids are effective in reducing neonatal mortality and morbidity when administered to those with severe disease between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation.

Treatment frequently requires multiple medications and can be expensive.; This study measured the impact of substituting low-dose, fixed-combination therapy using the calcium channel blocker (CCB) amlodipine and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazepril for high-dose CCB monotherapy or dual therapy with a CCB and an ACE inhibitor on antihypertensive drug costs, the incidence of adverse events, and blood-pressure control.; A multicenter, pilot pharmacotherapy quality improvement program was undertaken in a long-term care facility setting. Consultant pharmacists reviewed pharmacy records and medical charts from long-term care facilities, identifying older patients with a diagnosis of hypertension who either took CCB concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor or experienced adverse events on high-dose CCB therapy. Eligible patients were identified and their physicians contacted regarding switching them to fixed-dose combination therapy.; A total of 51 patients at 17 facilities were switched to fixed-dose amlodipine/benazepril combination therapy; 94.1% were women and 5.9% were men (mean age, 85.1 years; range, 64-99 years). The mean number of comorbidities was 1.6. During the subsequent 2 months, mean blood pressure remained at levels similar to those at baseline. The number of patients reporting at least 1 drug-related adverse event decreased by 81.8% (P < 0.05), and the incidence of edema decreased by 75.0%. The mean per-patient cost of antihypertensive drugs decreased by 33.1% (P < 0.001), a mean per-patient savings of 19.21 US dollars per month.; In patients aged > or =65 years with hypertension in long-term care facilities, a change from high-dose CCB monotherapy or CCB/ACE-inhibitor dual therapy to fixed-dose combination amlodipine/benazepril therapy significantly reduced drug costs and the incidence of adverse events and maintained blood-pressure control.",3,E

We sought to compare the magnitude of the distress induced by a widely used calcium channel blocking agent, amlodipine, and a new aldosterone antagonist, eplerenone, in patients treated for systolic hypertension.; A total of 269 patients older than 50 years with systolic hypertension were randomized to either eplerenone, 50 mg/d, or amlodipine, 2.5 mg/d, and titrated to a maximum 200-mg eplerenone dose or 10-mg amlodipine dose. Patients were followed up for 24 weeks. Quality-of-life questionnaires (SF-36 Health Survey) and a validated instrument for assessing symptom distress (Symptom Distress Index) were administered at randomization and 24 weeks after starting treatment.; The systolic blood pressure response to eplerenone and amlodipine did not differ (eplerenone = -20.5 mm Hg and amlodipine = -20.1 mm Hg). For the quality-of-life analysis, 119 patients were randomized to eplerenone and 122 to amlodipine. No significant treatment group differences in the Symptom Distress Index were detected at baseline. There was an overall significant treatment effect on symptom distress in favor of eplerenone (P =.03). Indeed, Symptom Distress Index showed significant worsening distress in 36 of 71 symptoms in the amlodipine arm and none in the eplerenone arm. Significant treatment effect in favor of eplerenone was observed in 5 symptoms: ankle swelling, weight gain, nocturia, increased urination, and shortness of breath. Patients with symptom distress also showed an erosion of psychosocial measures of quality of life (P<.001).; The aldosterone antagonist eplerenone is substantially better tolerated than the widely used calcium-channel blocking agent amlodipine, with comparable reductions in systolic blood pressure. This feature should improve therapeutics in patients in whom blockade of aldosterone's effect would be helpful.",2,E

Conversely, a meta-analysis suggested that these drugs may increase cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease.; To investigate whether nisoldipine retards the progression of coronary atherosclerosis or reduces the occurrence of clinical events.; The NICOLE study (NIsoldipine in COronary artery disease in LEuven) is a single centre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial with coronary angiography at baseline, six months, and three years of follow up.; 826 patients who had undergone successful coronary angioplasty were randomised to nisoldipine 40 mg once daily or placebo. The intention to treat and per protocol population consisted of 819 and 578 patients, respectively.; In the per protocol population, 625 of the nisoldipine treated and 655 of the placebo treated patients (NS) showed angiographic progression in at least one coronary arterial segment, defined as an increase in diameter stenosis of > or = 13%. The average minimum luminal diameter of the non-dilated lesions decreased by 0.163 mm and 0.167 mm in the nisoldipine and placebo groups, respectively (NS). The respective numbers of new lesions detected were 7 and 13 (NS). In the intention to treat population, the rates of death, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction were similar in both treatment groups. However, nisoldipine use was associated with fewer revascularisation procedures and thus the percentage of patients with any clinical event was lower (44.6% v 52.6%, p = 0.02).; Nisoldipine has no demonstrable effect on the angiographic progression of coronary atherosclerosis or the risk of major cardiovascular events but its use is associated with fewer revascularisation procedures.",I,4

Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is the predominant form of hypertension in the elderly. Effects of angiotensin II on the vascular wall and endothelium may contribute to development of ISH.; The primary objective of this study was to compare the effects on trough sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) of a regimen of losartan, a selective angiotensin II-receptor antagonist, and an amlodipine-based regimen in patients with ISH.; This multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study consisted of a 4-week placebo phase and an 18-week active-treatment phase. The losartan-based regimen consisted of losartan 50 mg, increased as needed to losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg at week 6 and to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg at week 12 to achieve a target SiSBP <140 mm Hg. the amlodipine-based regimen consisted of amlodipine 5 mg, increased as needed to amlodipine 10 mg at week 6 and to amlodipine 10 mg/HCTZ 25 mg at week 12. The primary efficacy measure was change in trough SiSBP from baseline to week 18. Information on the tolerability of study treatments was collected at each visit, including the investigator's and patient's observations of clinical adverse experiences (CAEs), laboratory adverse experiences, and responses to a symptom questionnaire.; Eight hundred fifty-seven patients (65.6% female) were randomized to treatment, 432 in the losartan group and 425 in the amlodipine group. Their mean age was 67.6 years, and they had a mean duration of hypertension of 6.7 years at baseline. The losartan and amlodipine groups (intent-to-treat population) had baseline mean SiSBP values of 171.2 and 171.9 mm Hg, respectively. At week 18 (the primary end point), the mean change from baseline in SiSBP was -27.4 mm Hg for 426 patients who received losartan and -28.1 mm Hg for 419 patients who received amlodipine (estimated least-square mean difference, 0.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, -1.4 to 2.0), indicating that losartan's effect on systolic blood pressure was noninferior to that of amlodipine. The proportion of patients who responded (SiSBP <140 mm Hg or a > or =20-mm Hg decrease in SiSBP from baseline) was comparable between groups (73.9% losartan, 75.4% amlodipine). The incidence of CAEs and drug-related CAEs was significantly greater in the amlodipine group (amlodipine, 79.8% and 43.8%, respectively; losartan, 67.8% and 25.5%; P < or = 0.001). In addition, more patients in the amlodipine group discontinued therapy due to a drug-related CAE compared with patients in the losartan group (12.9% vs 4.4%, respectively; P < or = 0.001). Lower-extremity edema was the most common drug-related CAE in the amlodipine group (24.0% amlodipine, 2.5% losartan; P < or = 0.001); dizziness was the most common drug-related CAE in the losartan group (6.0% losartan, 4.0% amlodipine).; In these patients with ISH, losartan and amlodipine produced comparable clinically relevant reductions in SiSBP; however, losartan was better tolerated, as evidenced by fewer CAEs and discontinuations compared with amlodipine. Losartan may be considered for the initial treatment of ISH.",2,E

Calcium-channel blockers are associated with poor outcomes in patients with heart failure, in part due to neurohormonal activation. In contrast, amlodipine, a second-generation dihydropyridine, has a more favorable clinical profile.; In the Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation 2 (PRAISE-2) trial, a subset of 181 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy were randomized to amlodipine (10 mg/day) or placebo. Blood samples were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks and 26 weeks for norepinephrine, epinephrine, angiotensin II, dopamine, N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (Nt-pro-ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), adrenolutin and malondialdehyde.; There was no difference in levels of neurohormones or oxidative stress markers between the amlodipine and placebo groups at the different times. Both Nt-pro-ANP and BNP decreased at 2 weeks and at 26 weeks. Baseline Nt-pro-ANP correlated with survival in multivariate analysis (P =.001). A strong relationship was found between a reduction in BNP at 26 weeks and survival, with a hazard ratio of 0.153 (95% CI 0.051-0.461, P =.017). No relationship was found between markers of oxidative stress and survival.; We conclude that amlodipine does not affect circulating neurohormones and oxidative stress markers in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin and diuretics. In addition, low circulating Nt-pro-ANP and a reduction in BNP over time confers a good prognosis.",2,E

Other trials have since been published. In the HPS trial, which studied patients with coronary heart disease, other cardiovascular conditions, or diabetes, simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of death, coronary events and stroke when compared with placebo. In the ALLHAT-LLT trial, in patients with treated hypertension, pravastatin did not reduce overall mortality. In the PROSPER trial, in patients aged over 70 with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors, pravastatin reduced the incidence of coronary events relative to placebo, but did not reduce overall mortality. Pharmacovigilance studies suggest there is no difference between these four statins in terms of their potential to cause rhabdomyolysis. Taken together, these trials show that statin use can be extended to patients with levels of LDL-cholesterol over 2.4 mmol/l (0.9 g/l) if they have coronary heart disease (and no hypercholesterolaemia), a history of ischaemic stroke, or lower-limb arterial disease. Statins can also be prescribed for diabetic patients with no signs of cardiovascular disease but whose LDL-cholesterol exceeds 3.4 mmol/l (1.3 g/l). Clinical trial data support the use of pravastatin or simvastatin in these situations, at a dose of 20 or 40 mg daily.

Despite theoretical benefits, calcium channel blockers (CCB) are not widely used in the perioperative setting. This systematic review assessed the efficacy of CCBs during noncardiac surgery. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, PubMed, and reference lists were searched without language restriction for randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating CCBs during noncardiac surgery. Two reviewers independently abstracted data on death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVT), and congestive heart failure (CHF). Treatment effects were calculated as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Eleven studies (1007 patients) were included. CCBs significantly reduced ischemia (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30-0.80; P = 0.004) and SVT (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.37-0.72; P < 0.0001). CCBs were associated with trends towards reduced death and MI.

In subgroup analyses, diltiazem significantly reduced ischemia, SVT, death/MI, and MMEs. This meta-analysis shows CCBs significantly reduced ischemia, SVT, and combined end-points in the setting of noncardiac surgery. The majority of these benefits are attributable to diltiazem, suggesting the need for further evaluation of this drug in a large RCT.",4,E

12963858,Treatment of hypertension in older patients: an updated look at the role of calcium antagonists.,Aged; Calcium Channel Blockers; Humans; Hypertension; Middle Aged,"Kostis, John B","Hypertension is common in adults aged 60 years or older. Apart from age, hypertension is the most powerful predictor of cardiovascular end-organ damage and its associated morbidity and mortality. Although diastolic blood pressure is regarded as an important risk factor, it is now clear that systolic blood pressure, especially prevalent among older adults, is a better predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Fewer than 30% of hypertensive patients have blood pressure levels controlled to <140/90 mm Hg as recommended by current guidelines. Controlled trials have demonstrated the benefits of lowering blood pressure for all hypertensive individuals, including those aged 65 years or older. Calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine subclass, which include nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, and nitrendipine, as well as other drug classes, are potent antihypertensive agents that may be suitable for treatment of hypertension in older adults. However, as with all antihypertensive agents, adverse effects may limit their use; peripheral edema is particularly troublesome for dihydropyridines. Newer dihydropyridine calcium antagonists expected to be approved for use soon, including lercanidipine and lacidipine, have been associated with efficacy comparable to currently available calcium antagonists but with a lower incidence of adverse effects, especially ankle edema. Antihypertensive agents with improved tolerability profiles offer the potential for improved blood pressure control.",5,E

Given these safety concerns, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of a prolonged QT interval in palliative care patients who were not in the terminal stage and were referred to a specialist service. Of 300 patients, 47 (16%) had prolonged QTc but only two had QT >500ms. The presence of coexistent cardiac disease or high levels of serum alkaline phosphatase appear to be the clinical features most robustly associated with a prolonged QTc.

The main drugs involved were: pristinamycin (18 cases), amoxicillin (+/- clavulanic acid) (16 cases), hydroxychloroquine (8 cases) and a combination of spiramycin + metronidazole (5 cases).; The most frequent causal drugs in our study and in the literature are: amoxicillin +/- clavulanic acid, pristinamycin, hydroxychloroquine, ampicillin, diltiazem, co-trimoxazole, terbinafine, carbamazepine and spiramycin +/- metronidazole. Only pristinamycin and diltiazem have information in their summary of product characteristics regarding the risk of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Because it is essential to discontinue the causative drug as soon as possible if a pustular eruption occurs, physicians must be informed of the risk, which should be added to the ""adverse events"", and ""warnings"" sections of the summary of product characteristics of the drugs concerned.; Our results show the relevance of notification of side effects by physicians to pharmacovigilance centres, leading to the identification of a signal and public health dissemination of warnings.",1,E

Although it has been suggested that women who have taken calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have an increased risk and that women who have taken angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a decreased risk, currently, no conclusions can be drawn.; A population-based case-control study of women ages 65-79 years was conducted in western Washington State. The responses of 975 women who were diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma during 1997-1999 were compared with the responses of 1007 women in a control group. Associations between use of different types of antihypertensive medications and breast carcinoma incidence were evaluated using logistic regression.; Overall, women who had ever used CCBs, beta-blockers, or ACE inhibitors did not have an altered risk of breast carcinoma relative to women who had never used antihypertensive medications. Although the use of immediate-release CCBs, thiazide diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics was associated with modestly increased risks of breast carcinoma (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.0-2.1; OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8; and OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1, respectively), the absence of any trend in the size of excess risk with increasing duration or with current versus former use of these agents argues for a cautious interpretation.; The use of particular types of antihypertensive medications, including immediate-release CCBs and certain diuretics, may increase the risk of breast carcinoma among older women. Additional studies are warranted to clarify these potential associations. Cancer 2003;98:1504-13.",I,I

However, only 40-45% of these patients are cured with CHOP. New treatment strategies have been employed, including the addition of Rituximab to CHOP in elderly patients; dose escalation using granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor; overcoming the multidrug resistance phenotype with infusional chemotherapeutic regimens and use of some newer agents. Furthermore, the International Prognostic Factor index (IPI) has permitted identification of subsets of patients with large variations in prognosis, allowing prognosis specific therapy to be tested. There is now accumulating evidence that the clinical behavior of certain NHL can be profiled by the expression of certain molecular markers, which will undoubtedly play a role in the development of new prognostic models that may refine our ability to identify poor-risk patients. Regardless, there is still significant opportunity for improving survival in large cell lymphomas.",4,E

Studies evaluating glucagon for those uses were identified using the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MedLine, ToxLine, and EMBASE searches, as well as reviewing medical toxicology textbooks and references of identified articles. Only controlled studies of human or animal studies were included, the latter only when it was an in vivo model of acute poisoning. The quality of the included studies was assessed.; The search found no study in humans but identified 30 in animals. In the five studies of animal models of beta-blocker overdose included, glucagon appeared to consistently increase the heart rate at least transiently but appeared to have no effect on mean arterial pressure even though it possibly increased cardiac output. Its effect on the survival rate in animal models of beta-blocker overdose was unclear. In the six studies of animal models of calcium channel blocker overdose included, glucagon appeared to increase heart rate and cardiac output and reverse second and third degree AV blocks, all at least transiently. There appeared to be no effect of glucagon on mean arterial pressure although it did increase in one model. Glucagon appeared to have no effect on survival rate. The included studies for both overdoses were not blinded, had limited numbers of animals, and some had inadequate glucagon regime.; The evidence supporting the use of glucagon in the management of patients with beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdoses is limited to animal studies.",3,E

The rate of reported sexual dysfunction increases when information is sought aggressively in the clinical interview. The relationship to a specific therapeutic agent, however, can be clouded by the patient's perception and coexisting morbidity. Most of the data relating sexual dysfunction to specific drugs are anecdotal. The strongest proof of a casual effect is improvement in sexual function after withdrawal of the medication. Most of the adverse sexual effects of commonly used medications can be predicted from a simplified understanding of the human sexual response and physiologic mediators. Alternative therapeutic agents can be substituted by understanding these physiologic mechanisms and a careful clinical interview.

This conclusion was based solely on an analysis of secondary end points and cost. As evidenced by the dictum to ""use thiazides for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension"" in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, this interpretation of ALLHAT broadly adumbrated these guidelines.

7506652,Sotalol. An updated review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in cardiac arrhythmias.,"Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Humans; Sotalol; Treatment Outcome","Fitton, A; Sorkin, E M","Sotalol is a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist which prolongs cardiac repolarisation independently of its antiadrenergic action (class III antiarrhythmic properties). The antiarrhythmic action of sotalol appears to arise predominantly from its class III properties, and the drug exhibits a broader antiarrhythmic profile than the conventional beta-blockers. Sotalol is effective in controlling paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias and the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation/flutter in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, in maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation/flutter, and in preventing initiation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias following coronary artery bypass surgery. Sotalol shows promise in the control of nonmalignant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, particularly those associated with ischaemic heart disease. It is effective in suppressing complex forms of ventricular ectopy, displaying superior antiectopic activity to propranolol and metoprolol. The acute efficacy of sotalol in preventing reinduction of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and suppressing spontaneous episodes of these arrhythmias on Holter monitoring is translated into long term prophylactic efficacy against arrhythmia recurrence in approximately 55 to 85% of patients with refractory life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, sotalol offers the advantage over the class I agents of reducing cardiac and all-cause mortality in the high risk population with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The adverse effects of sotalol are primarily related to its beta-blocking activity and its class III property of prolonging cardiac repolarisation. Sotalol is devoid of overt cardiodepressant activity in patients with mild or moderate left ventricular dysfunction. The overall arrhythmogenic potential is moderately low, but torsade de pointes may develop in conjunction with excessive prolongation of the QT interval due to bradycardia, hypokalaemia or high plasma concentrations of the drug. In summary, sotalol displays a broad spectrum of antiarrhythmic activity, is haemodynamically well tolerated, and confers a relatively low proarrhythmic risk. It is likely to prove particularly appropriate in the treatment and prophylaxis of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias.",5,E

Subjects were randomly allocated to receive nifedipine (n = 52) or felodipine (n = 56) over 8 weeks at increasing doses until the sitting office diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was < 90 mm Hg. An ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) recording and echocardiogram were performed at baseline and upon completion of the study. At the end of the dosing interval, felodipine lowered office DBP (mm Hg) by -18 +/- 12/14 +/- 1 compared to -14 +/- 2/11 +/- 1 for nifedipine (P < or = .05). Mean 24-h ABP was reduced (P < .001) by felodipine (-15 +/- 1/-10 +/- 1 mm Hg) and nifedipine (-15 +/- 1/-9 +/- 2 mm Hg). However, nifedipine caused an apparent biphasic response with felodipine reducing (P < .05) blood pressure more in the early afternoon compared to nifedipine. Left ventricular mass index was significantly reduced (P < .01) by felodipine (-6 +/- 1 g/m2), but not by nifedipine. Once-daily administration of felodipine achieves a more consistent control of blood pressure compared to twice-daily nifedipine and may be associated with a greater reduction in left ventricular mass.",5,E

We assessed whether antihypertensive therapy may restore a nocturnal blood pressure (BP) fall in this condition. A sustained-release oral formulation (SRO) of isradipine was used, and the possible differences in the response to morning nu evening dosing were also investigated. Sixteen hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure due to parenchymal kidney disease were studied after 2 weeks of single-blind placebo runin. According to the double-blind, randomized, cross-over design, they received 5 mg isradipine SRO at 08:00, or at 20:00 for 4 weeks, separated by a single-blind placebo period of 2 weeks. A 24-h BP monitoring at 10-min intervals was carried out at the end of each treatment using a SpaceLabs 90207 instrument. Under placebo, blunt BP profiles were observed, whereas HR showed a mean nocturnal fall of 17.4%, which remained unaltered after isradipine. Both isradipine treatments were equally effective in reducing the mean 24-h BP levels. However, the evening regimen showed a more pronounced effect during the night. The mean nocturnal fall in systolic/diastolic BP represented 4.8/8.7% and 7.5/10.9% of the corresponding daytime mean after morning and evening dosing, respectively. Only the evening administration reset the normal synchronization of the 24-h BP and HR profiles. Our findings demonstrate that antihypertensive treatment may restore a nocturnal BP fall in renal patients. An evening regimen of isradipine SRO seems more apt than a morning regimen to obtain this therapeutic goal.",5,E

All patients had a history of unstable angina combined with typical ECG changes and without evidence of a previous, recent, or ongoing myocardial infarction. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the relationship between the patency of the culprit artery and the behavior of the ischemia-related regional left ventricular (LV) wall motion.; On entry to the study, all patients received conventional drug therapy: i.v. nitroglycerin therapy, an oral beta-blocking agent, and a calcium antagonist. Baseline angiography was carried out within 3 h after randomization, a mean of 4.2 +/- 3.0 h (range, 1 to 17 h) after the last attack of chest pain. Treatment with trial medication was withheld in 33 cases. Sixty-five patients with coronary artery disease received anistreplase (30 U/5 min)/heparin and 61 patients heparin-only therapy. Angiography was repeated 20.6 +/- 4.6 h (mean +/- SD; range, 12 to 39 h) after the baseline angiographic study. To assess changes in regional myocardial wall motion, the LV wall was divided into seven segments. The ischemia-related coronary artery stenosis was calculated quantitatively and related to the quantitatively assessed mean regional left ventricular ejection fraction (RLVEF) of the ischemia-related segments. In 118 of 126 patients who received trial medication, we found that anistreplase/heparin therapy leads to a significantly (p < 0.01) greater reduction in coronary artery diameter stenosis than heparin-only therapy (n = 63, mean +/- SD, 11 +/- 22, vs n = 55, mean +/- SD, 3 +/- 11%). Anistreplase/heparin therapy was related to a larger significant improvement of the ischemia-related RLVEF than heparin-only therapy, although the latter association was not statistically significant (n = 63, mean +/- SD, 7 +/- 15, vs n = 55, mean +/- SD, 5 +/- 14%). The effects of change of coronary artery stenosis on regional LV wall motion were also determined. A paradoxical finding was that a persistently occluded vessel or a vessel showing an increase in coronary artery stenosis was associated with a greater improvement of the ischemia-related RLVEF than a reopened vessel or a vessel with a reduction in coronary artery stenosis (n = 15, mean +/- SD, 7 +/- 11, vs n = 41, mean +/- SD, 8 +/- 13, vs n = 15, mean +/- SD, 1 +/- 12, vs n = 47, mean +/- SD, 5 +/- 16%, NS). One day after the last attack of chest pain, the regional LV wall motion was still abnormal in about 20% of patients.; In these patients with unstable angina, the LV wall motion improved both in the treated and the control group at follow-up angiography 1 day later. Improved coronary arterial anatomy was associated with a lesser improvement of the LV contractile function than when worsening of the coronary angiographic appearance occurred. There is no rational explanation of these results. This is a beginning of an effort to elucidate the clinical significance of the stunned and hibernating myocardium in humans.",2,E

The daily dosage of enalapril was increased, if required, from 10 to 20 to 40 mg and that of nifedipine from 40 to 60 to 80 mg at 4-week intervals during the 12-week titration period. Blood pressure, 24-h urinary albumin excretion (UAE), biochemical data, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity were measured at weeks -6, -4, 0, 4, 8, and 12. At week 0, venous blood was also sampled for baseline plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, renin, aldosterone, and serum insulin concentrations.; At week 12, the mean daily dose of enalapril was 35 +/- 11.4 mg, and 27 (57%) patients were receiving the maximum daily dose of 40 mg. In the nifedipine group, the mean daily drug dose was 50 +/- 12.9 mg, and 4 (8%) were receiving the maximum daily dose of 80 mg. Despite a dose-dependent fall in the serum ACE activity in the enalapril group, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced by only 8 mmHg throughout the 12-week titration period compared to a decline of 15, 18, and 19 mmHg at weeks 0, 4, and 12, respectively, in the nifedipine group (P = 0.01 between groups). In the enalapril group, changes in MAP between weeks 0 and 12 correlated significantly with baseline plasma glucose (r = 0.45, P = 0.001) and aldosterone concentrations (r = -0.32, P = 0.02) and UAE (r = 0.3, P = 0.04). There was no statistically significant correlation between the changes in MAP and baseline plasma renin concentration. On multivariate analysis, the baseline renal function, glycemic control, and plasma aldosterone and serum insulin concentrations were all independently related to the changes in blood pressure in the enalapril-treated patients. No such statistical associations were observed in the nifedipine group.; In hypertensive NIDDM patients, the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the level of serum insulin, glycemic control, renal function, and proteinuria may be important determinants of the blood pressure response to ACE inhibition. Good glycemic control may optimize the antihypertensive efficacy of concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy.",5,E

In dogs receiving saline (control, n = 10), heparin (100 U/kg, n = 5), aspirin (325 mg, n = 5), or prostacyclin (15 ng/kg/min, n = 5), a 30-cm, woven, loop-shaped, DeBakey arterial prosthesis was implanted as a substitute for the infrarenal aorta and exposed to reduced blood flow (50 ml/min) for 4 h. The parameters of the blood measured included activated clotting time (ACT) and platelet aggregation with collagen, determined before and after each treatment. Blood deposits were quantified using 111In labeled platelets and 125I-labeled fibrinogen. The ACT was significantly prolonged only after heparin treatment, and platelet aggregation, which was decreased by 35% (p < 0.05) after heparin treatment, was almost abolished after aspirin and prostacyclin treatments. As compared with the control group, both platelet and fibrin uptake on the luminal surface of the prostheses were reduced significantly by heparin by 87 and 37%, respectively. Despite their inhibition of platelet aggregation in vitro, aspirin and prostacyclin induced no significant change in platelet and fibrin deposition on the luminal surface of the woven polyester arterial prostheses under low blood flow conditions. Under such conditions, however, thrombin generation with subsequent platelet-fibrin deposition was prevented by use of heparin anticoagulant therapy.",E,E

A similar trend was observed in patients randomized to diltiazem SR (n = 7), which suggested a training effect, and, therefore, equal efficacy between diltiazem SR and diltiazem CD. During exercise testing in the diltiazem SR baseline phase, 77% of the patients did not experience angina, whereas 60% of the patients did not experience ST-segment depression. Following transfer to diltiazem CD, 79 and 61% of patients, respectively, remained angina- and ST-segment depression free. No significant changes in the number of angina attacks, nitroglycerin use, or any hemodynamic-related parameters were observed following transfer to diltiazem CD. Eleven percent of the patients receiving diltiazem CD experienced treatment-related adverse events, which were limited to headache and abdominal pain; these adverse events did not lead to discontinuation of treatment.

In contrast, significant treatment effects were not observed in patients with a high SDNN at baseline. Similar results were obtained using baseline total power or low-frequency power, but not when using baseline heart rate. Diltiazem reduced the total duration of ischemia by -4.9 minutes (-9.7 to -0.1), but not the number of episodes.

There are more data concerning diltiazem in the setting of AF complicated by congestive heart failure. The drug does not appear to exacerbate heart failure, although hypotension can result. In chronic AF complicated by heart failure, there is concern that diltiazem may increase mortality. Options for therapy are digoxin, beta-blockers and atrioventricular node ablation.; Calcium channel blockers may have a role in the acute reduction of ventricular response in patients with AF complicated by congestive heart failure; however, their safety in chronic heart rate control remains to be proven.",I,5

Clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by an average of 17/14 mmHg with isradipine and 17/13 mmHg with lacidipine, compared with placebo (P < 0.01 in both cases), without a change in heart rate. Mean ambulatory 24-h and daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced by sustained-release isradipine and lacidipine (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). At night systolic blood pressure fell compared with placebo (P < 0.05 with both drugs) whereas the reduction in diastolic blood pressure was not statistically significant. Mean 24-h heart rate remained unchanged. Blood-pressure variability did not differ significantly between the two drugs or between either drug and the placebo. The antihypertensive effects of sustained-release isradipine and lacidipine were similar, but the tolerability of isradipine appears to be greater since it caused fewer withdrawals.",5,E

Twenty consecutive patients treated with streptokinase for evolving acute myocardial infarction received continuous blood pressure and S-T segment monitoring of the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) for at least 5 h, commencing prior to commencement of the streptokinase infusion. Aggravation of injury, manifested both by episodic increases in S-T segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) (P < 0.001), and in mean S-T segment elevation (P < 0.05) occurred within the first 20 min after initiation of streptokinase infusion. Hypotension also occurred transiently in most patients, with a mean minimum systolic blood pressure of 92 +/- 22 (S.D.) mmHg occurring 16 +/- 5 min after commencement of streptokinase. There was no correlation between the extent of aggravation of injury and that of hypotension. All patients showed ECG evidence of reperfusion, with a reduction of S-T elevation in the reference lead to 50% of maximal value, after a median of 62 min (range 9-174 min). It is concluded that streptokinase aggravates injury prior to reperfusion, although probably not via the induction of hypotension: It is possible that this effect contributes to the 'early hazard' of thrombolytic therapy.",3,E

The three treatment periods were amlodipine, doxazosin (study A) or enalapril (study B), and the combination of amlodipine with the second drug.; Each treatment was taken for 1 month, preceded by a 2-week single-blind run-in period, in which the patients received a low dose of doxazosin (study A) or enalapril (study B) to enable recruitment of patients with moderate or severe hypertension. Blood pressure, foot volume and plasma noradrenaline concentration were measured at the end of each run-in and treatment period.; The combination of alpha-blockade and calcium antagonism caused a fall in supine and erect blood pressures. These falls were significantly greater than on either drug alone, and greater than the sum of the falls when taking the individual drugs. The combination of amlodipine and the ACE inhibitor was also additive. Both combinations with amlodipine were tolerated well by all patients.; The combination of alpha-blockade and calcium antagonism has not previously been studied and should be useful for resistant hypertensives who have not tolerated beta-blockade or ACE inhibitors. The combination of ACE inhibition and calcium antagonism has previously been shown to be additive; its use as a positive control in the present studies suggests that the use of an active drug for a run-in period may be a useful design for permitting the study of patients from whom all treatment cannot safely be withdrawn.",2,E
7601014,Spirapril. A preliminary review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of hypertension.,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Enalapril; Humans; Hypertension,"Noble, S; Sorkin, E M","Spirapril is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prodrug which is converted to the active metabolite spiraprilat following oral administration, and which has been evaluated primarily for the treatment of hypertension. In dose-finding studies of patients with mild to severe hypertension, spirapril > or = 6 mg once daily produced reductions in blood pressure of approximately 10 to 18 mm Hg (systolic) and 7 to 13 mm Hg (diastolic) [24-hour postdose trough readings at the end of the treatment period]. Blood pressure normalisation (trough diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) had occurred in 29 to 50% of patients at the end of these investigations. The dose-response curve for spirapril appears to be flat for doses of 6 to 24 mg once daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited in number, and further studies are required before the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril can be fully evaluated. However, in single, well controlled clinical trials, spirapril produced similar reductions in blood pressure to those seen with enalapril or captopril. When given as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, spirapril may offer potential advantages over the calcium antagonist nitrendipine. Spirapril is generally well tolerated and produces an adverse event profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Data from small studies suggest that spirapril can be used without dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment, as a consequence of its dual renal and hepatic clearance mechanisms. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are eliminated by a predominantly renal mechanism that results in accumulation of the active metabolite when renal function is impaired. However, the utility of spirapril in this patient group has yet to be fully determined because of conflicting data regarding its effects on renal function. Thus, spirapril is an effective antihypertensive agent which is well tolerated. Further comparative trials are needed to fully determine its efficacy with respect to other ACE inhibitors, and a better understanding of its effects on renal function will clarify its role in hypertensive patients with renal failure.",3,E

Occupational histories of 272 men and women with CRF (of all types) were compared with those of 272 controls matched for age, sex, and region of residence. Exposures were assessed and degree and frequency were scored independently by three industrial hygienists unaware of case/control status. Significantly increased risks of CRF were found for exposure to lead (odds ratio 2.11 [95% CI 1.23-4.36]), copper (2.54 [1.16-5.53]), chromium (2.77 [1.21-6.33]), tin (3.72 [1.22-11.3]), mercury (5.13 [1.02-25.7]), welding fumes (2.06 [1.05-4.04]), silicon-containing compounds (2.51 [1.37-4.60]), grain dust (2.96 [1.24-7.04]), and oxygenated hydrocarbons (5.45 [1.84-16.2]). The frequencies of various occupational exposures were high among patients with diabetic nephropathy. This epidemiological study confirms previously identified risk factors and suggests that additional occupational exposures, for which there is some other experimental evidence, may be important in the development of CRF. The role of grain dust and the association between occupational exposure and diabetic nephropathy merit further investigation.",5,E

Its primary mechanism of action is vasodilatation, which results in diminished vascular resistance and improved perfusion to various vascular beds and target organs. The antihypertensive efficacy of diltiazem in various demographic groups has been studied and compared with diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and other calcium-channel blockers. These studies have shown that the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is similar to that of the other therapies. Diltiazem does not adversely affect electrolytes or carbohydrate or lipid metabolism, and it may have beneficial effects on the heart and kidneys. Diltiazem reduces myocardial hypertrophy and exerts antianginal effects on the heart through coronary vasodilation and reduction in the blood pressure double product. Diltiazem improves renal perfusion and attenuates proteinuria. These effects may be helpful in limiting the progression of renal injury. Overall, the efficacy and tolerability of diltiazem, as well as its salutary effects on the heart and kidneys, make it an important therapeutic consideration for patients with hypertensive disease.",5,E

Diltiazem at a dose of 0.25-0.30 mg/kg BW or disopyramide at a dose of 50 mg were given bolus IV. If conversion of the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm could not be achieved with the initial drug, the alternate was given. The order of administration of the drugs was random, independent of the type of the arrhythmia. Before and during drug administration detailed clinical examination and frequent blood pressure (BP) measurements were performed. Twenty-four hour Holter monitoring was done in all patients, starting with the administration of the antiarrhythmic drug.; 1) Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia: diltiazem administration converted the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm in all patients while disopyramide in only 1 of 9 patients who received this drug. 2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: disopyramide converted the arrhythmia in 5 patients without significant change in ventricular response in the others. Diltiazem did not convert the arrhythmia though it caused significant decrease in ventricular response (< 100 bpm) and in 1 patient an important bradycardia (45 bpm). 3) Atrial fluttering: disopyramide converted the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm in 1 patient without significant change in the ventricular response in the others. Diltiazem caused significant decrease in the ventricular response without conversion to sinus rhythm. During conversion to sinus rhythm an AV junctional rhythm of short duration (< 1 min) was noticed in 5 patients and a short pause (< 2 sec) with or without an initial premature contraction in the remaining 21. Disopyramide administration was not associated with side effects. Diltiazem administration cause small (< 20 mm Hg), transient (< 30 min) decrease of BP without symptoms with the exception of the patient with bradycardia in whom the BP decrease was significant (90/60 from 160/80 mm Hg) followed by intense symptoms which lasted for six hours.; Diltiazem administration is extremely effective in conversion of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia to sinus rhythm.

The results are also compared to the voluntary reports on rash as a possible adverse drug reaction sent to the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). Specific types of skin rash (e.g. exfoliative dermatitis) are excluded. The rate of rash has been calculated for 2 periods, the first month (T1) and the subsequent 5 months (T2) after the first prescription for the drug. Despite the heterogeneity of the patient groups, the rate for rash between the 2nd and 6th months was consistent in the 36 drugs and probably represented the baseline rate of rash due to a variety of nonspecific causes. This rate (T2) was around 1 per 1,000 patients per month (ranging from 0.5 to 2 per 1,000 patients per month). On the other hand, in the first month after the first prescription for the drug, the rate (T1) varied substantially from 0.9 to 6.4 per 1,000 patients per month. Diltiazem had the highest first monthly rate. These rates are listed for the 36 drugs. The difference of the rates was tested by 2 methods: a standard statistical test assuming a Poisson model and a method based on the ratio of the rates for the 2 periods.

The mean decreases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure from baseline were 13.4/10.7, 12.8/10.2, and 7.3/6.6 mm Hg for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, amlodipine, and enalapril, respectively. The mean change with enalapril was less than the other drugs (p < 0.01), although the once-daily dosing of enalapril and the maximum dose of 20 mg might not have been optimal for this agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",I,I

As coprescription with diltiazem has not been previously studied, the objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit of the addition of trimetazidine (60 mg/24 h) to diltiazem (180 mg/24 h) in the stable exertional angina insufficiently improved by calcium channel blocker alone. This multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted over a period of 6 months. The inclusion criteria were stable angina with electrically positive stress test, which remained positive despite a 15-day treatment with diltiazem (180 mg/24 h). It was conducted in 67 patients randomized into two groups: diltiazem-placebo (group I: 35 patients) and diltiazem-trimetazidine (group II: 32 patients). The follow-up consisted of clinical assessment and a stress test on inclusion and at 6 months. The two groups were similar on inclusion for all ergometric parameters, excepted for the time to onset of the ischaemic threshold of 1 mm and the total duration of effort, which were significantly longer in the placebo group. Comparison of the stress tests performed at the sixth month and on inclusion between groups I and II showed that the ischaemic threshold of 1 mm was significantly delayed by 2 minutes 41 seconds in the trimetazidine group (p < 0.001) versus 42 seconds in the placebo group (NS). Similarly, the work performed at this threshold was significantly increased by 1446 kpm in the trimetazidine group (p < 0.001) versus 564 kpm in the placebo group (p = 0.012). The difference between the two groups was significant for these two parameters, p = 0.008 and p = 0.018, respectively. At maximum effort, the total duration and the total work also increased significantly in the trimetazidine group, by 50 seconds (p = 0.006) and 570 kpm (p = 0.004), respectively, versus 16 seconds and 221 kpm in the placebo group (NS). The [double product (SBP x HR)/load (in watts)] ratio at the ischaemic threshold of 1 mm reached at M0, decreased significantly in the trimetazidine group by 69.9 (p < 0.001) versus 20.3 in the placebo group (NS).

Dexverapamil was added to subsequent cycles after resistance had been demonstrated. Dexverapamil treatment was begun 18 hours before day 1 of vinblastine administration and was given orally every 6 hours for 12 doses. Patients in group A were treated with a dose of 120 mg/m2, and those in group B were treated with 180 mg/m2 plus dexamethasone; plasma concentrations achieved in patients were correlated with in vitro effects.; Toxicities included hypotension, asymptomatic bradycardia, and mild atrioventricular conduction delays, although one patient had dexverapamil discontinued for grade IV congestive heart failure. There were no partial or complete responses. The mean day-1 serum dexverapamil plus norverapamil plasma concentrations were 2,575 ng/mL (range, 697 to 6,015 ng/mL) for group A and 1,654 ng/mL (range, 710 to 4,132 ng/mL) for group B at the time of vinblastine administration. These concentrations were in the range of those that reversed vinblastine resistance in vitro.; The advantage of dexverapamil as an MDR reversal agent is its potential for achieving desired blood levels with substantially less toxicity than the racemic mixture of verapamil. Based on tolerability, it is a suitable drug for further study in clinical trials of malignancies other than RCC that attempt to achieve MDR reversal. The dose of 120 mg/m2 given orally every 6 hours, with dose escalation based on individual tolerance, represents a feasible schedule to be considered for such studies.",1,E

Both Amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide significantly reduced supine and erect blood pressure. Supine blood pressure on Amlodipine fell from a mean of 190/104 mm Hg to 150/79 mm Hg, and on thiazide from 180/103 mm Hg to 141/84 mm Hg. There was, however, no significant difference between both drugs in antihypertensive efficacy. Neither drug induced a reflex increase in heart rate. The fall in blood pressure on both agents was associated with an increase in plasma urea. Amlodipine induced no change in plasma potassium, but hydrochlorothiazide caused hypokalemia.

Controls were a stratified random sample of hypertensive GHC enrollees, frequency matched to the cases on age, sex, and calendar year. All 623 cases and 2032 controls had pharmacologically treated hypertension. Data collection included a review of the ambulatory medical record a brief telephone interview of consenting survivors. Antihypertensive therapy was assessed using the GHC's computerized pharmacy database.; The first analysis included only the 335 cases and 1395 controls initially free of cardiovascular disease. Compared with users of diuretics alone, the adjusted risk ratio of myocardial infarction was increased by about 60% among users of calcium channel blockers with or without diuretic (risk ratio = 1.62%; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.11 to 2.34; P = .01). The second analysis was restricted to 384 cases and 1108 controls who were taking either a calcium channel blocker or a beta-blocker. Among these subjects, the use of calcium channel blockers compared with beta-blockers was associated with about a 60% increase in the adjusted risk of myocardial infarction (risk ratio = 1.57; 95% Cl, 1.21 to 2.04; P < .001). While high doses of beta-blockers were associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction (trend P = .04), high doses of calcium channel blockers were associated with an increased risk (trend P < .01).; In this study of hypertensive patients, the use of short-acting calcium channel blockers, especially in high doses, was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Ongoing large-scale clinical trials will assess the effect of various antihypertensive therapies, including calcium channel blockers, on several important cardiovascular end points. Until these results are available, the findings of this study support the current guidelines from the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure that recommend diuretics and beta-blockers as first-line agents unless contraindicated, unacceptable, or not tolerated.",I,6

Recent trials of any calcium antagonist and formulation were also reviewed for information about the possible mechanisms of action that might increase mortality. Overall, the use of nifedipine was associated with a significant adverse effect on total mortality (risk ratio, 1.16, with a 95% CI of 1.01 to 1.33). This summary estimate fails to draw attention to an important dose-response relationship. For daily doses of 30 to 50, 60, and 80 mg, the risk ratios for total mortality were 1.06 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.27), 1.18 (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.50), and 2.83 (95% CI, 1.35 to 5.93), respectively. In a formal test of dose response, the high doses of nifedipine were significantly associated with increased mortality (P = .01). While the mechanism of this adverse effect is not known, there are several plausible explanations, including the established proischemic effect, negative inotropic effects, marked hypotension, recently reported prohemorrhagic effects attributed to antiplatelet and vasodilatory actions of calcium antagonists, and possibly proarrhythmic effects.; In patients with coronary disease, the use of short-acting nifedipine in moderate to high doses causes an increase in total mortality.

The beneficial effects of tocolytic therapy vastly outweigh the risks associated with their use for the prolongation of gestation. Even a short extension of in utero life for a few days or weeks can significantly and positively affect neonatal survival and long-term outcome. Although the opponents of tocolytic therapy argue that no reduction in the PTB rate has occurred since their introduction, this argument does not consider that the large majority of PTBs are not eligible for tocolytic intervention. If patients with clear indications for tocolysis could be compared with those that were not treated (which most studies have not done), a substantial beneficial effect of tocolytic administration probably would be demonstrated. Based on available data, we consider MgSO4 and terbutaline to be first-line tocolytics. Magnesium is used more often because of its lower side-effect profile. Indomethacin and nifedipine should be reserved for difficult or refractory preterm labor, and should only be used for intervals of < or = 48 hours. We have attempted to present a method of decision analysis which should be followed for every patient who is admitted to the obstetric care unit for a presumptive diagnosis of premature labor.

Hypertension is observed to be the most common associated risk factor in both sexes. The management of patients with atrial fibrillation is evolving as a result of a number of published studies. Calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers are emerging as the preferred choices for rate control rather than digoxin. Low-dose anticoagulation therapy has shown beneficial effects not only in primary prevention, but also for secondary prevention of thromboembolism. Thus, patients who cannot be successfully cardioverted should be anticoagulated if there are no contraindications (Table 3) and if they do not fall into the low-risk group--defined as patients under the age of 65 without risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, previous stroke). Patients not eligible for anticoagulation should be on aspirin therapy. Patients with lone atrial fibrillation are not at higher risk for thromboembolism than the general population; therefore, they can be managed without anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Antiarrhythmic treatment should be approached cautiously; amiodarone in low doses is the most effective and safe treatment, but this remains controversial.",3,E

Mean 24-h ABPM was reduced from 184 +/- 13/119 +/- 6 to 148 +/- 18/96 +/- 11 mm Hg at 3 months (P < .0001). The reduction in BP was sustained for 24 h after dosing. Simultaneous BP measurements using a conventional cuff method and Dinamap were significantly different from the ABPM pre- and posttherapy, suggesting a marked ""white coat"" pressor effect. LV mass index regressed from 143 +/- 36 to 122 +/- 32 g/m2 at 3 months (P < .02). Heart rate and mean body weight were unchanged. Left ventricular performance was not adversely affected. Cardiac index and fractional shortening changed insignificantly, from 2.6 +/- 0.6 to 2.7 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2, and from 28 +/- 6 to 31 +/- 7%, respectively. Adverse effects were few and tended to disappear during the treatment period. All of the clinical laboratory parameters tested remained unchanged. We conclude that in this group of patients long-acting isradipine 1) showed a marked and sustained antihypertensive action demonstrated by 24-h ABPM; and 2) was well tolerated and associated with LV mass regression without adverse effect on systolic cardiac function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",I,6

This multicenter study was a nonrandomized, placebo run-in, open-label, 3-month trial followed by a 1-week, double-blind, randomized period during which most patients (89%) received placebo. There were only minimal changes in the time to termination (mean change +/- SEM -5.8 +/- 9.6 seconds), time to onset of angina (10.5 +/- 12.2 seconds), and the time to 1 mm ST-segment depression (2.9 +/- 12.5 seconds) from the end of the titration phase to the end of the open-label study. There were, however, statistically significant differences between the end of the 3-month treatment phase and the end of the 1-week randomized placebo phase for those 3 efficacy parameters (-37.3 +/- 11.2, -58.6 +/- 13.6, and -45.6 +/- 16.4 seconds, respectively). Diltiazem significantly decreased the frequency of anginal attacks and nitroglycerin use at the end of the 3-month treatment phase compared with results at the end of the randomized double-blind placebo phase. No new or unusual adverse events were reported during treatment.

The area under the curve of the high-frequency range (f = 0.18-0.35 Hz) during controlled respiratory rate (f = 0.25 Hz) was used as a quantitative index of parasympathetic activity. Twenty-four male patients with proven coronary artery disease and normal left ventricular function (LVEF > 60%) were studied 2 weeks after chronic treatment with diltiazem (3 x 60 mg daily) or metoprolol (3 x 50 mg daily) before and after administration of the drug. Twelve patients received diltiazem and 12 patients metoprolol. After administration of diltiazem the peripheral systolic blood pressure was reduced, but the parasympathetic activity was significantly higher than compared with the initial measurement. The same effect was seen for metoprolol, but a significant lower heart rate was present after administration. The relative area under the high-frequency range significantly increased at rest, by 110% after diltiazem and 70% after metoprolol. Diltiazem and metoprolol enhance the vagal influence at the heart, thereby leading to an enhancement of barosensitivity and of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

Those initially receiving isradipine then received atenolol and vice versa. After each therapy regimen, blood was drawn at rest and 1 h after exercise during a maximum exercise test. Platelet activity in vivo was estimated as release of B-TG and PF-4. Fibrinolytic activity was estimated as the fast-acting inhibitor against tissue plasminogen activator usually termed PAI-1. During atenolol and isradipine therapy, blood pressure (BP) was equally reduced (p < 0.05). Heart rate (HR) decreased during atenolol treatment but was not changed by isradipine. Platelet activity in vivo estimated as B-TG and PF-4 decreased irrespective of therapy (p < 0.02).

Venous compliance was not different between the two borderline hypertensive groups and was only slightly lesser than in controls. Large artery compliance was studied using a non-invasive ultrasound vessel wall movement detector system, while venous compliance was determined by means of strain gauge plethysmography. The borderline hypertensive subjects were subsequently treated with enalapril 10 mg/day, felodipine 5 mg/day or placebo during six months. Despite similar reductions in blood pressure, enalapril induced a significant increase of the muscular femoral and brachial artery compliance, but not of the elastic carotid artery, while felodipine did not influence large artery compliance at all in the sodium-sensitive group. The effect of enalapril on muscular artery compliance was established through a dose-dependent increase in distension and not through a change in arterial diameter. Arterial compliance was not influenced by either of the drugs in the resistant group. Venous compliance was also not altered by the medication. In conclusion, femoral and brachial artery compliance in sodium-sensitive borderline hypertensive subjects, which was found to be lower than that of sodium-resistant subjects, improved with antihypertensive treatment with enalapril but not with felodipine, despite the similar reductions in blood pressure induced by both drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",5,E

Treatment must reduce pressure in the renal vasculature, otherwise glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow will continue to deteriorate. Isradipine a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, has been investigated as a suitable treatment in this setting. Isradipine maintains glomerular filtration rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers, isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients. Side effects with isradipine are usually mild and transient, occurring in a dose-dependent manner.",5,E

The percentages of patients in each treatment group with increases of 10 mm Hg or more in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure were similar. Statistically significant increases in weight were seen with both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapies. Changes in pulse rate were not significant. The incidence of adverse effects was similar across all three treatment groups.; The addition of naproxen or ibuprofen to the treatment of hypertensive patients in whom blood pressure is controlled by once-daily verapamil does not cause an increase in blood pressure.

Whereas both drugs significantly increased the levels of glycolysated haemoglobin (HbA1c, +0.24%, P < 0.005 for nifedipine and +0.43%, P < 0.001 for furosemide), only furosemide increased fasting blood glucose (+0.3 mmol/L, P < 0.01) and fasting insulin (+2.2 mU/L, P < 0.05) but impaired the early insulin response to i.v. glucose (-15 mU/L, P < 0.05). Insulin sensitivity on the other hand was significantly impaired by nifedipine treatment only (-1.6 mg/kg/min, P < 0.01). Whereas treatment with nifedipine did not change serum lipids, furosemide caused an increase in serum cholesterol (+0.2 mmol/L, P < 0.05) because of a rise in the LDL fraction (+0.32 mmol/L, P < 0.001). The insignificant change in heart rate induced by nifedipine treatment correlated with the change in HbA1c (r = 0.50, P = 0.05) and was inversely related to the change in insulin sensitivity (r = -0.56, P < 0.05). In conclusion, both furosemide and nifedipine caused abnormalities in glucose metabolism. In the nifedipine group the effects on glucose metabolism were related to the occurrence of tachycardia suggesting that sympathetic nerve activation could be involved in the metabolic impairments.",5,E

All of them were switched to the opposite dietary salt regimen and continued on verapamil for 4 more weeks (Salt-Switching-Period). Office BP and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were registered before and after the Salt-Switching-Period. Salt intake was checked by urinary sodium excretion (UNa). Patients switching from high- to low-salt reduced UNa from 180.9 +/- 22.9 to 89 +/- 28 mM Na/24h (P < 0.001) and patients switching from low- to high-salt increased UNa from 85 +/- 38.4 to 175.8 +/- 57.5 mM Na/24h (P < 0.001). No significant changes in BP were found by ABPM either in the group switching from high- to low-salt or in the group switching from low- to high-salt. In the latter group, a significant increase was observed in office DPB but not in SBP. Short-term changes in salt intake seem to have little influence on the BP of patients pharmacologically controlled with verapamil.",5,E

Thirty patients (28 M, 2F) were included in the final analysis, mean age 56.5 +/- 9.1 years (SD), mean weight 73.5 +/- 9.2 kg, mean height 171.5 +/- 6.5 cm, all with unstable angina. Nicardipine was given at a daily dosage of 80-120 mg, and nifedipine 40-60 mg, for up to one month. At the end of treatment with nicardipine supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) dropped respectively 7.7% and 5.5% at 8 am and 8.6% and 7.1% at 8 pm. Nifedipine reduced SBP and DBP by respectively 6.5% and 13.1% at 8 am and 5.3% and 9.4% at 8 pm. There was no clinical or statistical difference between the treatments. Heart rate did not change appreciably during either treatment. On completion of nicardipine treatment, 87.5% of patients had suffered no angina attacks, compared with 66.7% for nifedipine. The remaining 12.5% of patients treated with nicardipine presented only one mild angina attack per day, while the other 33.3% of the nifedipine patients had one moderate angina attack per day. No untoward effects were reported with nicardipine; one patient receiving nifedipine presented cardiopalmus and another complained of headache. These results indicate that nicardipine is at least as safe and effective as nifedipine in the treatment of unstable angina.",7,E

Patients were randomized to receive either cilazapril 2.5-5 mg or atenolol 25-100 mg per day per day. Blood pressure before treatment was 147/99 and 148/99 mmHg in both groups respectively. At 1 year of treatment blood pressure was 132/86 and 131/85 mmHg in both groups of patients respectively. Treatment for one year with cilazapril resulted in a reduction in the media/lumen ratio of resistance arteries (150-400 microns lumen diameter) dissected from subcutaneous gluteal biopsies from 7.5 +/- 0.3% before treatment to 6.3 +/- 0.2% 1 year later (p < 0.05), still slightly but significantly larger (p < 0.05) than the media/lumen ratio of resistance arteries of normotensive controls (5.1 +/- 0.3%). In arteries from patients treated with atenolol there was no significant change with treatment (8.0 +/- 0.6% before and 8.1 +/- 0.5% after 1 year of treatment). Active wall tension responses to endothelin-1 were blunted in hypertensive patients and normalized in the cilazapril-treated patients, but were unchanged in those taking atenolol. Relaxation in response to acetylcholine of norepinephrine pre-contracted arteries was still significantly reduced after one year (< 0.05) in comparison to those of normotensive patients in the patients treated with atenolol, whereas they were not in those who had received cilazapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",6,E

They were compared with 25 normotensive (NT) men of similar age. At baseline (BL), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) (clearance of inulin and para-aminohippurate), and the UAE were studied. Thereafter, all antihypertensive drugs except beta-blockers were withdrawn and either felodipine (5 to 20 mg; n = 13) or ramipril (2.5 to 10 mg; n = 15) was added in a double blind, randomized fashion. Hydrochlorothiazide was added if necessary. The investigations were repeated after 6 weeks and 1 year of double-blind treatment. At BL, the BP and the renal vascular resistance (RVR) were significantly higher and GFR and RPF were significantly lower in both hypertensive groups than in NT. After 1 year, the BP treatment goal was reached by all patients in the felodipine group but only by two-thirds in the ramipril group in spite of addition of diuretics to 60% of the latter group. In the felodipine group, the BP, GFR, and RVR after 1 year no longer differed significantly from normal. The UAE and the fractional albumin clearance increased significantly after 1 year's treatment in the felodipine group but did not change in the ramipril group. The fractional albumin clearance, however, did not differ significantly from normal either at BL or after 1 year's treatment in any of the hypertensive groups. It is therefore possible to reduce BP and improve renal function in primary hypertension to levels not significantly different from normal after treatment with felodipine in combination with beta-blockade. Although this regimen increased the low UAE slightly, the fractional albumin clearance changed less and did not differ significantly from normal. The ramipril/beta-blocker combination reduced BP less and did not change the slightly reduced renal function or the UAE.",I,5

To examine these interactions, we measured supine and standing blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac index (CI) for 6 h in 24 hypertensive patients after 2 weeks of placebo, again after the first dose or 3 weeks of therapy (SS) with either 120 mg verapamil (V) twice a day, or 1 mg terazosin (T) titrated weekly to 5 mg daily, and finally when T was added to V (group VT) or V added to T (group TV), acutely and at SS. Changes in supine hemodynamics when T was added to V or when V was added to T were similar and included a further reduction in BP, a transient increase in HR, and little or no change in CI. Both groups experienced significant decreases in standing blood pressure, especially 0.5 to 2 h following initiation of combination therapy despite significant increases in standing HR and CI. Standing BP tended to be lower in group TV after the first dose, but minimum standing systolic BP was not significantly different between groups (group TV 97 mm Hg at 1 h; group VT 109 mm Hg at 1.5 h, P > .05). Four patients in group TV and two in group VT experienced symptomatic orthostatic hypotension with the first dose of double-agent treatment. Pharmacokinetic interactions, including an increase in the bioavailability of T when V was added, did not correlate with the degree of orthostasis. After 3 weeks of combined therapy, the orthostatic change in BP had attenuated and symptoms had improved in all patients. We conclude that T and V represent an effective combination for the treatment of essential hypertension, but that orthostasis may result when initiating combination therapy. The orthostasis seen in some patients appears to be due to the combined vasodilatory effects rather than negative ionotropic or chronotropic effects.",5,E

Because of their unique mechanisms of actions, calcium channel blockers may not be subject to this interaction. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to assess the effect of NSAID therapy on blood pressure control in stable hypertensive patients treated with a calcium channel blocker. One hundred patients with stable blood pressure control on 30 mg nicardipine three times a day were treated with 375 mg naproxen twice a day or placebo for 4 weeks. The mean diastolic blood pressures and estimated mean arterial pressures in both groups changed < 1 mm Hg during the 4 weeks of study drug treatment. None of the changes was significantly different from baseline and the two treatment groups were not significantly different from each other. Body weight in the placebo-treated patients did not change significantly whereas body weight in the naproxen-treated patients increased significantly, from 90.3 +/- 3.2 kg to 91.0 +/- 3.2 kg (mean = 0.7, P = .0003). At 4 weeks there was a mean loss of 0.1 kg in the placebo group and a mean gain of 0.4 kg in the naproxen group compared to baseline weights, neither of which was statistically significant (P = .60 and P = .071, respectively). These results indicate that despite a significant increase in body weight, the antihypertensive action of the calcium channel blocker nicardipine is not significantly affected by cotreatment with naproxen.",5,E

The coadministration of food affects the nifedipine pharmacokinetics with differing magnitudes for the two formulations. To evaluate drug safety under the most rigorous circumstances, all medication was given with food. After a 4-week placebo lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to a parallel-group treatment period of either NIF CC or NIF GITS. 30 mg daily with food for 4 weeks, followed by forced titration to nifedipine 60 mg daily for an additional 4 weeks. For the final 4-week period, half of the patients receiving each formulation were switched to the alternate formulation at a dose of 60 mg daily. Within treatment groups, all four blood pressure variables (systolic and diastolic measurements for both trough and 24-hour periods) demonstrated significant reductions (P < 0.05) from baseline (established after the placebo lead-in period) for both formulations at every subsequent visit and end point. When comparing the two formulations, the mean change from baseline in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements, determined by using ambulatory monitoring, was not statistically different for both doses (P > 0.05). The mean change in trough blood pressure from baseline during the parallel-group treatment period was statistically significant in favor of NIF GITS for both the 30-mg and 60-mg doses (P < 0.05). The treatment-emergent adverse-event rates for both formulations were similar during the parallel-group period, with the exception of dizziness, which was higher for patients receiving NIF CC. Both formulations were well tolerated and reduced blood pressure over the 24-hour dosing interval even when coadministered with food. When half of the patients receiving NIF GITS 60 mg daily were randomly crossed over to NIF CC 60 mg daily, there were no significant changes in either the trough or 24-hour mean blood pressure measurements (P > 0.05), adverse events, or dropout rates. When patients receiving NIF CC 60 mg were crossed over to NIF GITS 60 mg daily, they exhibited no significant change in diastolic blood pressure (P > 0.05).

Specifically, we compared Procardia XL with Adalat CC. They are the only once-daily-dosed, extended-release forms of nifedipine available. These drugs were interesting to compare for several reasons. First, because the frequency of treatment regimens has been shown to be the most important determinant of long-term compliance with calcium channel blocker medications, it was desirable to compare drugs having identical dosing regimens. Second, switching from one to the other should be quite feasible in most patients. Third, Adalat CC is priced (ie, average wholesale price) less than Procardia XL. The results indicate that prescription prices were lower when patients were switched from Procardia XL to Adalat CC, with no apparent effects on blood pressure control, the incidence of adverse drug reactions, or nonprescription health care costs. The potential savings to Medicaid from switching patients from Procardia XL to Adalat CC appears to be large, more than $2.5 million annually for Procardia XL-treated Medicaid patients in the state of Pennsylvania. Our study also demonstrates that large retrospective databases can be used to evaluate economic and clinical outcomes for specific therapy alternatives. Such evaluations are increasingly relevant to third-party payers, health maintenance organizations, and other parties involved in managed care.",I,6

The target supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (85 mm Hg) required the second agent in four of 13 evaluable patients in the felodipine group and six of 10 in the diuretic group. There was a significant rise in serum cholesterol and a fall in serum potassium in the diuretic group, but not in the felodipine group. Cardiovascular risk scores were ranked in percentiles in relation to the age-matched general population. This score fell to a greater degree in felodipine patients particularly over the first 6 months, but remaining lower at 12 months. Left ventricular hypertrophy assessed by echocardiography, another measure of cardiovascular risk, was generally unchanged by either regimen.

It can be a marker of underlying maternal disease processes aggravated by pregnancy, or it can be directly related to the pregnancy (pre-eclampsia). It is associated with increased risks of fetal growth retardation and, if severe, can cause both maternal and fetal problems. The risks to both mother and neonate can be reduced by appropriate supervision and therapy. Close monitoring of maternal and fetal welfare will help to determine the optimum time for delivery. Maternal hypertension should be controlled with agents considered to be well tolerated in pregnancy. Following the index pregnancy, all patients with early and/or severe hypertension should be investigated for an underlying cause.

An update of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.,"Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Interactions; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension; Isradipine; Postoperative Complications; Pregnancy; Renal Circulation","Brogden, R N; Sorkin, E M","Since the earlier review in Drugs substantial additional data have accumulated regarding the antihypertensive efficacy of isradipine in various clinical situations, as well as data on its clinical effects in atherosclerosis. Recent therapeutic trials confirm that the efficacy of isradipine in the treatment of patients with mainly mild to moderate hypertension, when administered orally as a conventional or modified release preparation, is similar to that of titrated dosages of amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, captopril, methyldopa, metoprolol, prazosin and hydrochlorothiazide. A further decrease in blood pressure can be expected when isradipine is combined with another antihypertensive drug in patients who have not responded adequately to monotherapy. Initial studies have shown that intravenous isradipine is effective in controlling hypertension following coronary artery bypass graft surgery and that it appears useful in the treatment of intraoperative hypertension and hypertensive crisis, and in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, when administered orally or intravenously. A large study, the Multicentre Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), was designed to compare the efficacy of isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the rate of progression of carotid artery wall thickness, measured by B-mode ultrasound, as a surrogate for early atherosclerosis. Results indicated that wall thickness increased significantly less with isradipine than hydrochlorothiazide after 6 months of therapy. Thereafter the rate of progression remained parallel for the remainder of the 3-year trial. The confirmation of its antihypertensive efficacy, along with its favourable haemodynamic profile and reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy, minimal effect on glucose and lipid metabolism, preservation of quality of life and good tolerability, makes isradipine a suitable drug for the treatment of most patients with mild to moderate hypertension.",2,E

An incremental dose-response effect was observed both in clinic and ambulatory blood pressure parameters. Doses of > or = 240 mg significantly decreased clinic diastolic blood pressure, whereas systolic blood pressure was significantly lowered by the 540-mg dose. Moreover, compared with placebo, ambulatory blood pressure was significantly decreased by the 360- and 540-mg dose levels. Trough/peak ratios for systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 50% and higher at dose levels of 240 mg and above. Adverse reactions with diltiazem OD ER were generally mild and similar to those observed with placebo. The findings of this study indicate that the most favorable effects of diltiazem OD ER were observed in response to the 360- and 540-mg dose levels.

Secondary end-points include total cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Entry criteria include a sustained sitting systolic blood pressure of 160 to 219mm Hg plus a sustained sitting diastolic pressure of 95 to 109mm Hg. Also required is a standing systolic blood pressure of at least 140mm Hg. Patients must give their informed consent, and be free of congestive heart failure requiring treatment, gout, renal failure or a recent cerebral haemorrhage. Patients are to be randomised to 3 groups-(i) no treatment; (ii) treatment with a diuretic [bendroflumethiazide (bendrofluazide)]; or (iii) treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril). Starting dosage for bendroflumethiazide and lisinopril is 2.5 mg/day. In order to achieve goal sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures (< 150/80 mm Hg), a doubling of the dosage is allowed. Furthermore, slow release diltiazem (120 mg/day increasing to 240 mg/day if required) may be added to the medication of the actively treated groups.

Echocardiograms were performed at baseline, at 3 months, and annually for 4 years. Changes in blood pressure averaged 16/12 mm Hg in the active treatment groups and 9/9 mm Hg in the NH only group. All groups showed significant decreases (10% to 15%) in LVM from baseline that appeared at 3 months and continued for 48 months. The chlorthalidone group experienced the greatest decrease at each follow-up visit (average decrease, 34 g), although the differences from other groups were modest (average decrease among 5 other groups, 24 to 27 g). Participants randomized to NH intervention only had mean changes in LVM similar to those in the participants randomized to NH intervention plus pharmacological treatment. The greatest difference between groups was seen at 12 months, with mean decreases ranging from 35 g (chlorthalidone group) to 17 g (acebutolol group) (P = .001 comparing all groups). Within-group analysis showed that changes in weight, urinary sodium excretion, and systolic BP were moderately correlated with changes in LVM, being statistically significant in most analyses.; NH intervention with emphasis on weight loss and reduction of dietary sodium is as effective as NH intervention plus pharmacological treatment in reducing echocardiographically determined LVM, despite a smaller decrease in blood pressure in the NH intervention only group. A possible exception is that the addition of diuretic (chlorthalidone) may have a modest additional effect on reducing LVM.",5,E

Furthermore, these hypertensive reactions result in life-threatening complications, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. In this study, the effect of the new, short-acting beta-blocker esmolol given as a single bolus for preventing the increases in blood pressure and heart rate during recovery from anaesthesia and extubation in patients with hypertension was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Sixty-three patients with a history of hypertension over a period of more than 6 months and blood pressure (BP) more than 150/90 mm Hg undergoing intervertebral-disc, otolaryngologic, or eye surgery were included in the study. The operations were performed during thiopentone-induced isoflurane anaesthesia with relaxation by atracurium. The patients were assigned to three groups after giving witnessed oral informed consent. During the study period they received the study drug twice: (A) 30-90 s before turning off the nitrous oxide; and (B) 20-90 s before extubation. Group I (placebo) received placebo each time, group II (100 mg esmolol) placebo at A and 100 mg esmolol i.v. at B, and group III (200 mg esmolol) 100 mg esmolol i.v. each time. After each medication the cardiovascular parameters were measured noninvasively over a period of 10 min every minute and in the following 2 h every 15 min. RESULTS. After the first medication systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate (HR), and rate-pressure product (RPP) were lower in patients receiving 100 mg esmolol (Group III) than in groups I and II. After the second injection the blood pressure was lower in the two groups receiving 100 mg esmolol, than the placebo group (I: 180.1 +/- 7.4/100.7 +/- 3.6; II: 152.8 +/- 5.8/87.9 +/- 3.4; III: 157.9 +/- 5.3/91.5 +/- 3.6 mm Hg [mean 2 min +/- SEM]). The changes in HR (I: 88.2 +/- 3.8; II: 75.6 +/- 2.6; III: 72 +/- 3.1 min-1) and RPP (I: 15,800 +/- 900; II: 11,700 +/- 700; III: 11,400 +/- 600) were similar. In 8 of the 20 patients in group III the HR dropped below 60.min-1, but in none of these patients did the BP become instable. CONCLUSIONS. The sympathoadrenergic reaction during recovery from anaesthesia and extubation can be treated by beta-blocking agents, but such therapy is not without risk because of the long half-life and effects of the therapy on other factors such as postoperative loss of intravascular volume. Esmolol is a new, short-acting, cardioselective beta-blocker with a very short plasma distribution time and a elimination half-life of 9.2 min. Thus, the potential risks of beta-blockers due to half-life are minimised. The results of this study show that a dangerous increase in BP and HR with increased myocardial oxygen consumption can be prevented by a single bolus, and better by a double bolus of 100 mg esmolol. Although bradycardia with HR below 50.min-1 in 8 patients might indicate a risk of cardiac instability, the systolic BP did not fall below 100 mm Hg, and the episode of bradycardia was so short that there was no risk to the patients.",6,E

After four weeks of placebo administration, lipids and lipoproteins were measured in the fasting state and every three hours for a period of nine hours after intake of a standardized fat mixed load (65 g/m2). Following this test, the patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: group I metoprolol (n = 10), 100 mg/day; group II nicardipine (n = 9), 90 mg/day; group III captopril (n = 11), 75 mg/day.

Thus, in many cases restauration of sinus rhythm is indicated because of the negative effects of reduced cardiac output. Quinidine has been the first line drug for many years and has been proven to be highly effective especially when combined with Verapamil. But there is growing concern about using quinidine and other class I-anti-arrhythmic agents because of some hints in clinical trials for increased longterm mortality on these drugs. This study was undertaken to test the efficacy of Sotalol, a beta-blocker with additional strong class-III antiarrhythmic action, compared to a fixed combination of Quinidine and Verapamil for conversion of chronic atrial fibrillation and maintenance of sinus rhythm after medical or electrical cardioversion. To avoid early proarrhythmic effects, potassium values in the range of ""high""-normal values (> 4.3 mval/L) were tried to be obtained. 82 patients were randomly assigned to receive either Sotalol or Quinidine/Verapamil. There was no difference between the groups as far as the underlying heart disease, duration of atrial fibrillation (mean 219 days) and other clinical features including echocardiographic parameters were concerned. The dose of the drug was weight-related individually adjusted, and the drug was continued thereafter. If sinus rhythm could not be established at that time, electric cardioversion was performed and the drug was continued in lower dosage thereafter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",2,E

Since urinary albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretions reflect renal effects of hypertension, they were related to blood pressure, other cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac target organ effects, and response to therapy in mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 85-99 mm Hg). Participants were from two clinics of the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS), a multicenter randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Participants received nutritional-hygienic therapy and one of five active drugs or placebo. Urinary albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretions were assessed prospectively using office ""spot"" collections from one clinic (n = 213) and retrospectively using overnight collections from the other clinic (n = 210). Relationships were determined between protein excretions and blood pressure, age, gender, race, blood glucose, cholesterol concentrations, and indices of body mass and left ventricular mass and function at baseline. Treatment effects were assessed after 3 to 12 months. Spot and overnight albumin excretions related positively to baseline systolic blood pressure by univariate analyses. Spot albumin excretion related positively to systolic blood pressure, age, creatinine clearance, and left ventricular function while overnight albumin excretion related positively to left ventricular mass and female gender by multiple regression analyses. Spot, but not overnight, albumin excretion declined significantly with active drug therapy. N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretion did not relate to blood pressure or decline with therapy. The combined results suggest albumin excretion correlates with blood pressure, decreases with antihypertensive drug therapy, and is associated with greater left ventricular function and mass, as well as glomerular filtration rate, even at mild levels of hypertension.",2,E

AF and AFl are the arrhythmias most frequently encountered in clinical practice. Although occasionally unaware of their arrhythmia, patients usually complain of palpitations, weakness, dyspnea, and decreased exercise tolerance. The initial goal of therapy is control of the ventricular rate. Rate control is accomplished with atrioventricular node-blocking agents such as digoxin, calcium-channel blockers, or beta-adrenergic blockers. Along with a rapid, irregular ventricular response, other detrimental outcomes of AF and AFl include compromised hemodynamics and increased vulnerability to thromboembolism. After the cause of the patient's arrhythmia has been evaluated, pharmacologic treatment is directed at converting the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm and maintaining it. Antiarrhythmic drugs have proved effective in about 50% of cases but may be associated with increased mortality. More effective and safer forms of drug therapy for AF and AFl are needed. Nonpharmacologic alternatives to antiarrhythmic medications for refractory AF and AFl include radio-frequency catheter ablation of the bundle of His with pacemaker placement and surgery. Patients who remain in AF despite therapy should receive long-term warfarin treatment.

For 2 days the patients received open-label amlodipine and then, according to a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over and double-blind protocol, they were treated with amlodipine or placebo, respectively, once a day for 3 weeks each. Exercise tests and blood sampling for plasma concentrations of amlodipine were performed at 8 and at 24 h after dosing on both days of acute testing as well as on day 18 of chronic treatment. During chronic treatment, when plasma concentrations fluctuated between 23.5 ng.ml-1 at 8 h and 14 ng.ml-1 at 24 h post-dosing, ST segment depression at an individually comparable workload was significantly decreased by 28% compared with placebo (P < 0.005) at both points in time. Increases in ischaemia-free workload capacity amounted to 76% (P < 0.005) and to 81% (P < 0.01) at 8 and at 24 h, respectively. The number of anginal attacks was reduced by 39% (P < 0.05). Conversely, after initial dosing, i.e. when plasma concentrations declined from 4.7 ng.ml-1 to 3.9 ng.ml-1, influences upon ischaemic parameters compared to control values were markedly less at 24 h as opposed to 8 h.

To study the pharmacokinetics of both drugs, tolerability and antitumor activity in relation to the MDR1 expression in tumor tissue.; Sixteen colorectal cancer patients entered the study. Bepridil was administered by central venous catheter as 5-mg/kg bolus over 30 minutes, followed by 12 mg/kg for 12 hours and 5 mg/kg for 24 hours. Vinblastine 5 mg/m2 was administered as an intravenous (i.v.) bolus 24.5 hours after the start of bepridil. MDR1/P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression was assessed in 14 tumor samples by immunohistochemistry and RNase protection assay.; The bepridil plasma level was greater than 2 mumol/L at the time of vinblastine administration in all patients investigated. At the dose used in the study, bepridil produced a QTc-prolongation more than 50 ms, which prevented further dose escalation. However, cardiac toxicity was asymptomatic in all treated patients, and other side effects were mild. MDR1/Pgp expression was positive in nine of 14 cases. Of fifteen patients assessable for response, one complete remission of 8 months' duration and 14 progressions were observed. The responding patient attained complete remission again when re-treated on progression with vinblastine alone.; Bepridil plasma concentrations needed in vitro to modulate MDR could be achieved in this study with tolerable toxicity; however, despite most tumors being MDR1/Pgp-positive, no response was obtained that could be attributed to the drug combination. Mechanisms of drug resistance other than MDR are probably implicated in drug resistance of colorectal cancer.",6,E

Total exercise time increased compared with placebo at peak, but only a trend was seen at trough. Time to 1 mm ST-segment depression at peak and trough and ambulatory electrocardiographic parameters were also improved. Adverse effects were mild. This trial confirms that immediate-release nisoldipine when added to existent beta-blocker therapy is an active antianginal and anti-ischemic agent, but that the immediate-release formulation loses its antianginal effect at the end of its dosing interval (9 to 14 hours). This drug is therefore being examined in a new extended-release formulation (Coat-Core).",I,E

In contrast to gallopamil, esmolol significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (175.7 vs. 160 mm Hg) and heart rate (107.4 vs. 96.9 min-1) during exercise as well as cardiac output (11.57 vs. 9.38 l/min) and significantly enhanced systemic vascular resistance both at rest (1241 vs. 1479 dynes.s.cm-5) and during exercise (805 vs. 947 dynes.s.cm-5). On the other hand, exercise filling pressures and lactate levels (3.66 vs. 3.05 mmol/l) were significantly reduced by gallopamil only. Thus, the significant improvement of exercise tolerance by both esmolol and gallopamil is based on different mechanisms of action: esmolol improves myocardial ischemia by appreciably reducing myocardial oxygen consumption, whereas gallopamil primarily improves oxygen supply and ventricular performance. Plasma catecholamines, atrial natriuretic factor, and aldosterone levels as well as plasma renin activity were identically influenced by esmolol and gallopamil, respectively.

In response to sustained handgrip exercise, both quinapril and verapamil, but not atenolol, attenuated the pressor response. However, verapamil was associated with an exaggerated increase in forearm vascular resistance during handgrip, whereas quinapril did not alter this response compared to placebo.

In addition, no change was observed in the decrement of baseline blood pressure after switching from the other two drugs to long-acting nicardipine. Long-acting nicardipine had less effect on diurnal blood pressure variation than standard nicardipine tablets, which are administered three times daily. In each age group, long-acting nicardipine also more effectively inhibited the increase in cardiac work resulting from the morning rise phenomenon when compared with standard nicardipine tablets.

Significant differences were shown between bendrofluazide and the other two groups on diastolic pressures (p = 0.01). The non-significant trend was for systolic pressures to mirror these effects. Significantly higher withdrawals caused by adverse events were seen with nifedipine. These were as follows: 14 patients receiving nifedipine (18%), 5 patients receiving diltiazem (6%) and 4 patients receiving bendrofluazide (5%).

Regional strategies of drug administration may permit the delivery of high concentrations of a drug to specific areas with lower systemic levels. Colorectal cancers typically express the multidrug resistance phenotype.; A Phase I trial was performed to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities of verapamil by hepatic artery infusion, together with doxorubicin, to patients with hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer. Fourteen patients with metastatic colorectal cancer received a 14-hour intrahepatic infusion of verapamil. Six hours after the start of the infusion, a fixed dose of doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) was given, also via the hepatic artery, over a 30-minute period. Patients were followed by cardiac telemetry but were not in an intensive care setting, and no invasive monitoring was used. All patients had received prior intrahepatic chemotherapy.; The MTD of intrahepatic verapamil on this schedule in this patient population was 1.2 mg/kg/hour. Hypotension was the dose limiting toxicity. No major objective responses were noted in this heavily pretreated patient population. A dose of 1.0 mg/kg/hour is recommended for Phase II trials.; Based on estimations of normal hepatic artery blood flow, the estimated concentration of verapamil delivered to the hepatic tumors at 1.0 mg/kg/hour is 3.6 micrograms/ml (7.3 microM), which is comparable to concentrations at which an in vitro reversal of MDR is seen. This study demonstrates that the systemic toxicities of an MDR reversal agent can be overcome by regional drug delivery, establishing this approach as an important model system for further study of MDR modulation.",6,E

To assess the efficacy and safety of the calcium channel blocker, felodipine, and isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN), as adjunct to optimal beta-blocker therapy in elderly patients, a placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted in 46 patients, aged between 65 and 80 years, with documented stress-induced angina pectoris and myocardial ischemia. With use of a latin-square design, with 3 periods of 4 weeks each, exercise testing was performed after each period. Felodipine, 5 mg once daily, significantly improved both time to ischemic threshold and pain threshold (p = 0.02 and p = 0.003, respectively, vs placebo), and tended to increase total exercise time (p = 0.06 vs placebo). In contrast, ISMN, 20 mg twice daily, did not significantly affect these parameters. Comparison of the 2 active treatment arms showed that, overall, felodipine was more effective than ISMN, with a statistically significant difference for time to ischemic threshold (p = 0.02). With regard to safety, felodipine was also better tolerated than ISMN, which led to more patients discontinuing study medication with ISMN (p < 0.05 between ISMN and felodipine). It is concluded that in elderly patients who are treated with optimal beta blockade, felodipine, but not ISMN, leads to an additional significant reduction in ischemic parameters during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",I,E

Adequate blood pressure response occurred in 77% of the felodipine-ER group and 80% of the nifedipine GITS group; this difference was not significant. Blood pressure changes were similar among sex and race subgroups. A higher percentage of older patients (> 55 years of age) than younger patients (< or = 55 years of age) reached goal SiDBP with both drugs. Patients with adequate SiDBP response continued receiving their assigned medication for an additional 6-week maintenance period.

After 12 weeks a greater proportion of patients taking lisinopril was controlled (sitting diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg) than in those taking nifedipine. As a result, 17% of those taking lisinopril and 38% of those taking nifedipine required additional therapy with hydrochlorothiazide. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide resulted in similar response rates in the lisinopril and nifedipine groups (89% and 75% respectively). The rate of reporting of adverse events considered to be drug-related and the rate of withdrawals were similar for both treatments.

At discharge angina pectoris was reported in 11% of 869 patients randomized to verapamil and in 12% of 888 randomized to placebo (ns). One month after discharge a significant increase in the prevalance of angina pectoris was reported in both the verapamil (33%) (P < 0.001) and the placebo groups (39%) (P < 0.001).

Stable angina pectoris during the first month of follow-up was a significant predictor of major events (i.e. death or reinfarction) (hazard ratio = 1.45; 95% confidence limits: 1.10, 1.89). As verapamil significantly reduced the incidence of angina pectoris during daily activities, and thereby the number of patients at high risk, the beneficial effect of verapamil in reducing major events in patients recovering from myocardial infarction is likely to be due to abolishing myocardial ischaemia.",5,E

In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-design trial, the effects and tolerability of once-daily therapy with placebo or DCD (60, 120, 240, 360, or 480 mg) were evaluated 24 hours after dosing, following 3 weeks of therapy in 227 patients with reproducible stable exertional angina pectoris. A significant linear dose trend (p = 0.004) was present across the 6 treatment groups for the primary end point--time to exercise termination at 24 hours after dosing--using a standard Bruce treadmill exercise test. A significant linear dose trend was also seen for time to 1 mm ST-segment depression at 24 hours after dosing. Similar effects on exercise parameters were also seen at 4 hours after dosing. A linear dose trend (p = 0.04) was noted relative to the overall anginal attacks during daily activities and for anginal attacks during exercise (p = 0.02). Overall frequency of treatment-related adverse effects was dose-related and occurred in 24.4% and 17.5% of patients treated with DCD and placebo, respectively. At a dose up to 240 mg/day, improvement in exercise tolerance was achieved without an associated increase in the rate of treatment-related adverse events compared with placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",I,E

After a 4- to 6-week placebo baseline period, 111 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to receive placebo or diltiazem CD for a 4-week treatment period. Diltiazem CD 300 mg lowered supine diastolic and systolic blood pressure at trough significantly more than placebo (-7.5 mm Hg vs. -1.3 mm Hg, P = 0.0001 and -6.4 mm Hg vs. 0.5 mm Hg, P = 0.0051, respectively). Supine blood pressure was also measured hourly from 6 to 10 hours after the dose to assess peak effect and trough/peak ratios. Using the largest residual drug effect of -8.3 mm Hg at 6 hours as peak and the 24-hour residual drug effect of -5.9 mm Hg as trough, the trough/peak ratio was estimated to be 71%, with a lower one-sided 95% confidence limit of 50%. The precision of the trough/peak ratio is estimated by the lower confidence limit of 50%, which establishes the trough/peak ratio as statistically > or = 50%. No statistically significant differences in supine DBP were noted between the peak effect hours, indicating a plateau of the peak antihypertensive effect from 6 to 10 hours postdose. Diltiazem CD therapy was well tolerated, with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported during the trial and no patients discontinuing the trial due to a treatment-related adverse event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",5,E

Thirty patients with mild to moderate hypertension received propranolol (40-120 mg) or verapamil (80-200 mg) once daily in two separate ten week courses. After ten weeks treatment both drugs had significantly reduced both SBP and DBP. Beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) concentration, reflecting the status of platelet activation in vivo, was significantly decreased after propranolol (129.6 +/- 13.5 vs. 77.9 +/- 8.6 ng/ml) and verapamil (129.6 +/- 13.5 vs. 90.7 +/- 10.1 ng/ml) treatments while platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid or adrenaline and the production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and platelet cyclic 3'-5' adenosine monophosphate (C-AMP) concentration were not affected. Significant alterations in rheological parameters such as plasma and whole blood viscosity, fibrinogen level and red cell deformability were not found. Higher cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were observed after propranolol treatment but not in verapamil treatment. Side-effects were mild, tolerated and no patient had to be withdrawn from the study. In conclusion, propranolol and verapamil are generally effective antihypertensive as well as rheologically safe drugs. Compared with the metabolic effect on serum lipid, verapamil may be a better choice. Both drugs possess the tendency to inhibit platelet properties which is desirable in hypertension treatment.",5,E

BP and plasma nifedipine levels were measured at 24, two, four and six hours after dosing. The pattern of BP response to both doses was similar over the 24h period. However, a greater BP lowering effect was achieved with 60 mg compared with 30 mg. The BP lowering effect of both doses was less at 24h after the last dose compared with peak effect. Plasma nifedipine levels were significantly associated with the BP lowering effect in the group as a whole (i.e. the higher the nifedipine levels, the lower the BP) and were significantly less at 24 hours compared with peak. Nifedipine in the coat core formulation is effective in lowering BP in patients with essential hypertension. The 60 mg dose is more effective than the 30 mg dose and induces higher nifedipine levels which are associated with greater BP lowering effect. However, the maximum BP lowering effect is not maintained up to 24 hours.",3,E

At the conclusion of the trial the three drug groups did not differ in degree of reduction of diastolic blood pressure or in supplementation with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the 22-week trial, linear trend analysis showed no differences between the treatment groups in change from baseline on quality of life measures of well-being, physical status, emotional status, cognitive functioning, and social role participation. Regarding each of 33 physical side effects over the 22 weeks, we found no general difference between atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine groups on measures of change in distress over symptoms except for enalapril patients who worsened in distress over cough (P = .001) and atenolol patients who worsened in distress over dry mouth (P = .014).

Amlodipine (5-10 mg, once daily) and enalapril (10-40 mg, once daily) were found to be similarly effective in lowering blood pressure while not adversely affecting quality-of-life parameters. However, 20% of the enalapril group compared with 11% of the amlodipine group required the addition of hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure control (P < 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure was normalised or reduced by 10 mmHg in 204 (90%) patients on amlodipine and in 190 (85%) patients on enalapril. Side-effects were, in general, mild or of little clinical significance. The major side-effects recorded were class-typical of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, namely cough (enalapril) and oedema (amlodipine), respectively. Tolerability was very good, with only 17 patients (8 amlodipine, 4%; 9 enalapril, 4%) being withdrawn from the study due to side-effects definitely related to treatment. Amlodipine monotherapy produced a slightly beneficial effect on blood lipid concentration, and both drugs reduced the calculated 10-year risk of coronary heart disease.

If one broadens the treatment scenario to include mortality and morbidity, evidence of a beneficial impact has only been proven for beta-blockers and diuretics. With the primary aim of antihypertensive drug therapy given as a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors, the aim with regard to quality of life is that quality of life be maintained. The new guidelines on the management of mild hypertension issued in the United States highlight the danger of relaxing the concern for risk reduction and costs in favour of surrogate end-points, even though these may carry great significance in the individual patient.",5,E

Individuals were studied for 2 mo each on low- (UNaV < 50 meq/d) and high- (UNaV > 200 meq/d) salt diets, with the concomitant administration of nifedipine (10 mg t.i.d.) or placebo tablets for 1 mo of each diet. Salt loading elevated Cai and Nai while suppressing Mgi and pHi; these changes occurred predominantly in salt-sensitive subjects (n = 9). Nifedipine blunted the pressor response to salt loading > 50% (delta diastolic BP [high-low salt vs placebo] = 5 +/- 2 vs 14 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.05) and reversed salt-induced ionic changes, lowering Cai and elevating Mgi and pHi. Regardless of the definition of salt sensitivity, continuous relationships were observed between the pressure response to salt loading, the levels of Cai (r = 0.726, P < 0.001), Nai (r = 0.747, P < 0.001), and pHi (r = -0.754, P < 0.001), and the salt-induced change in Mgi (r = -0.757, P < 0.001). Altogether, these results emphasize the reciprocal and coordinate nature of intracellular ionic changes in response to dietary salt loading and calcium channel blockade in essential hypertension. They suggest that salt sensitivity is mediated by cellular calcium accumulation from the extracellular space, in association with magnesium depletion and acidification. Lastly, interpretation of intracellular ion measurements in the future will require concurrent assessment of dietary salt intake.",5,E

Following a 3-week washout period, mean +/- SD blood pressure levels were 153 +/- 17/99 +/- 4 mmHg in the enalapril group (n = 117) and 157 +/- 17/100 +/- 5 mmHg in the nifedipine-ER group (n = 113). Beginning at 5 mg once daily for enalapril and 30 mg once daily for nifedipine-ER, the dosage was titrated every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, up to a maximum of 40 mg for enalapril and 120 mg for nifedipine-ER. The treatment goal (satisfactory response) was to lower trough sitting diastolic blood pressure to < 90 mmHg or by at least 10 mmHg to a level of < 100 mmHg. At a mean daily dose of 16 mg of enalapril and 57 mg of nifedipine-ER, more than three quarters of each treatment group achieved a satisfactory response. The mean reductions in trough sitting blood pressure levels at the end of 22 weeks of treatment were 15/11 mmHg for enalapril and 21/13 mmHg for nifedipine-ER. The difference between treatments was significant only for the change in systolic blood pressure (P < 0.05). However, enalapril was better tolerated than nifedipine-ER. The numbers of patients with adverse experiences and withdrawals from the study because of an adverse experience were significantly lower for enalapril than for nifedipine-ER (P < 0.05). The incidence of abnormal laboratory findings was small and considered of no clinical importance in either group.

After a 4 week placebo phase, the diabetics and essential hypertensive patients did not differ in mean blood pressure (156/93 +/- 16/7 v 150/95 +/- 9/5 mm Hg), body weight, creatinine clearance, microalbumin excretion, and C-peptide and lipid levels, while serum fructosamine was higher in the diabetics. In both groups, amlodipine caused a significant and long-lasting decrease of arterial pressure (8%), but did not modify creatinine clearance, microalbumin excretion, and serum lipid levels. In diabetics indices of diabetic control and the insulin and glucose response to an oral glucose tolerance test were unchanged, whereas in essential hypertension the insulin response to a glucose load was decreased (P = .033). Amlodipine exerts a comparable and long-lasting antihypertensive effect in hypertensive diabetics and patients with essential hypertension. Despite the significant decrease in arterial pressure, there was no change in urinary microalbumin excretion. Lipid metabolism, quality of diabetic control, and the insulin response to a glucose load were not affected unfavorably.",I,2

In this paper, the gingiva of 18 patients suffering from cardiopathy and treated with nifedipine were compared with those of 10 patients with cardiac disorders who had not been treated with calcium antagonists and with a no-treatment group of 12 patients. Nifedipine produced gingival hyperplasia, although patients who had not been treated with calcium antagonists also had mild hyperplasia. Hyperplasia first appeared in the interproximal areas, an observation which may be important for early detection. There was a direct correlation between the degree of hyperplasia and the bacterial plaque score. When we studied the influence of administration time and dose of nifedipine with the degree of hyperplasia, no statistically significant differences were found.",5,E

Fasting venous levels of thromboxane B2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and leukotriene C4 were measured by radioimmunoassay. Bepridil decreased heart rate responses to daily activities during ambulatory monitoring, and significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the median frequency and duration of silent myocardial ischemic episodes (from 5.5 to 0 events/48 hours and from 86 to 0 minutes/48 hours respectively). Bepridil significantly decreased the blood pressure heart rate product at peak exercise and significantly prolonged the mean exercise tolerance time (from 456.6 to 527.0 second). Bepridil also significantly decreased the plasma levels of thromboxane B2 and leukotriene C4 at rest. These results suggest that bepridil may reduce silent myocardial ischemic episodes either by the reduction of cardiac oxygen demand during daily activities and exercise stress, or by controlling coronary and systemic vasomotor tone. The drug also has a salutary effect on eicosanoid metabolism, to which its efficacy on silent myocardial ischemic episodes may be related.",6,E

The study employed a randomised double-blind crossover design with allocation of treatment order within subjects by Latin squares. For each subject, after a single-blind run-in placebo phase, there were four randomised treatment phases each of six weeks duration, with a dose titration step at three weeks if necessary. Twenty-eight subjects entered the randomised phases of the study and twenty-one completed all four phases--13 male, 8 female (ages: median 71, range 59-85 years). At the end of both the felodipine and metoprolol phases systolic and diastolic pressure were reduced at 2 hours postdose compared with the placebo phase (p < 0.001), the blood pressure reduction with felodipine (-40/-20 mmHg) being greater than that with metoprolol (-15/-9 mmHg) (p < 0.01). Immediately predose (12 hours postdose) there was a persisting reduction of supine systolic blood pressure (-17 mmHg) with felodipine (p < 0.001), but there was no significant effect of metoprolol. At both measurement times the two drugs when in combination had an additive effect on blood pressure. There was a 20% increase in reported symptoms during each of the active treatment phases.

During each phase, doses were titrated to achieve a predose clinic supine systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or to a predetermined maximum dose. In both the felodipine and combination phases, predose supine and standing systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly reduced compared with the placebo phase (decrease in supine pressure: -13/-5 and -18/-7, respectively). Only predose supine diastolic pressure was significantly reduced (-3 mmHg) compared to placebo in the enalapril phase. In combination the effects of the two drugs on predose blood pressure were additive. There was a 40-60% increase in reported symptoms in the felodipine and combination phases compared with the placebo and enalapril phases. Thus, in elderly subjects with systolic hypertension, felodipine effectively reduces blood pressure throughout the dose interval but with vasodilator adverse effects. In contrast, enalapril is well tolerated but is less effective in reducing blood pressure throughout the whole dose interval.",2,E

Emphasis has been placed on the effects of antihypertensive treatment on renal hemodynamics and preservation of renal function. It has been suggested that some classes of antihypertensive agents may confer a greater renoprotective effect, especially agents that lower glomerular capillary pressure. Conversely, by virtue of their ability to preferentially dilate the afferent arteriole calcium antagonists theoretically could favor an increase in glomerular capillary pressure thereby accelerating the decline of renal function. In this review we survey the literature critically and conclude that in patients with essential hypertension and in patients with chronic renal insufficiency, calcium antagonists effectively reduce systemic blood pressure while maintaining glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. Preliminary results from a few long-term studies suggest that calcium antagonists may even attenuate the decline in renal function of patients with chronic renal failure. The majority of studies in humans, however, have been nonrandomized, of too short duration, or confounded by investigative difficulties precluding definite conclusions whether calcium antagonists have renoprotective effects. Although the possibility that calcium antagonists may retard progression of renal disease remains to be ascertained, the available evidence indicates that calcium antagonists may be used in patients with renal functional impairment without further exacerbating renal function.",3,E

In a double-blind controlled trial, 50 consecutive non-diabetic first kidney-transplant recipients were randomized to receive either isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, or placebo. There were no significant differences in age, weight, gender, warm and cold ischaemic periods, and original renal disease between treatment groups. Treatment was started intravenously 2 h before the transplantation procedure and was subsequently continued orally for 3 months. The immunosuppressive treatment included oral CyA from day 5 after a short course of anti-T-lymphocyte immunoglobulins. Hypertension was treated with oral labetolol in combination with guanfacine if necessary. Antihypertensive medication was prescribed significantly more often (16 vs 7 patients; p < 0.05) in the placebo group. Standing systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the isradipine group. The standing diastolic and both systolic and diastolic sitting blood pressures were similar in both groups. After 3 months, patients' mean serum creatinine was significantly lower with isradipine than with placebo (142.0 +/- 11.9 vs 164.0 +/- 10.8 mumol/l; p < 0.05). With isradipine, a significantly higher dose of CyA was needed to achieve adequate plasma levels (8.0 +/- 0.5 vs 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/kg/day; p < 0.01). It can be concluded that isradipine is an effective antihypertensive agent after kidney transplantation and may have an influence on CyA metabolism. Furthermore, isradipine appears to ameliorate CyA-induced nephropathy.",1,E

Patients received either isradipine (n = 72) or felodipine (n = 71) 2.5 mg twice daily. Doubling of this dose and the addition of enalapril (2.5 mg once daily) was permitted if DBP was > 90 mmHg at weeks 4 and 8, respectively.

The groups randomized to lisinopril or to nifedipine were not significantly different with respect to any demographic variable. An analysis of the pooled data from all centres demonstrated a significantly greater fall in both lying and standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) on lisinopril than on nifedipine treatment (difference between treatments 7.70 +/- 3.34 mmHg; P = 0.02 and 10.2 +/- 3.30 mmHg; P = 0.003 for lying and standing SBP, respectively). However, this difference may be accounted for by the slightly higher mean SBP in the lisinopril treatment groups compared with the nifedipine group at the end of the placebo run-in period. Both treatments lowered lying and standing diastolic blood pressures (DBP) to the same extent and the response rates to the two treatments were the same. The effects of the two drugs on heart rate were indistinguishable from each other. There were six lisinopril and 12 nifedipine-treated patients withdrawn during randomized treatment (P = 0.22). Nineteen per cent of lisinopril patients reported an adverse event compared with 36% of nifedipine patients. The relative risk of an adverse event on lisinopril compared with nifedipine was 0.42 (confidence limits 1.027-0.172) a difference which approached statistical significance (P = 0.0573). Lisinopril produced a greater reduction in both lying and standing SBP than nifedipine and both were associated with equivalent reductions in DBP.

Sublingual captopril (25 mg), nifedipine (10 mg) and prazosin (2 mg) were prescribed to determine the effectiveness and safety of each medication in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies during hemodialysis. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously up to 120 min postdose. The response rates were 83% for captopril, 90% for nifedipine and 11% for prazosin. The significant hypotensive effects of both sublingual captopril and nifedipine occurred at 10 min and continued up to 120 min. The reduction of systolic blood pressure occurred earlier in nifedipine than captopril (10 vs. 15 min). No significant difference in heart rate between them was noted. There were no side effects in the captopril group but flushing, tachycardia and headache were observed in 4 patients of the nifedipine group. We concluded that sublingual captopril and nifedipine were effective but captopril seemed to have less side effects than nifedipine and may be an excellent alternative to sublingual nifedipine in the urgent treatment of hypertensive emergencies in hemodialysis.

Hemodynamic data and blood gases were measured during inhalation of 3 gas mixtures: hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.15), normoxia (FIO2 = 0.21) and hyperoxia (FIO2 = 0.30). Each gas mixture was administered for 20 minutes, initially during an infusion of placebo and then of nicardipine giving a steady plasma concentration of 29 +/- 4 ng/ml. This was obtained by continuous I.V. infusion of 0.06 mg/kg/hour. Under basal conditions with placebo, the heart rate, cardiac output and pulmonary hypertension increased with decreasing concentrations of inhaled oxygen. The systemic blood pressure was unchanged with hypoxia but decreased during hyperoxia. Nicardipine increased the heart rate and the cardiac output but reduced the blood pressure with every inhaled oxygen mixture. The blood pressure was independent of FIO2 and the reduction observed during hyperoxia with placebo no longer occurred with nicardipine. However, the pulmonary hypertension was unaffected. At the dosage used in this study, nicardipine modified the systemic vascular response to oxygen but not the pulmonary vascular response. The vasodilation induced was much greater in the systemic than in the pulmonary circulation. In relation to the absence of significant pulmonary vasodilation, no changes in blood gases, due to a possible pulmonary shunting effect, were observed. At this dosage, nicardipine is ineffective in reducing pulmonary hypertension.

This study compared the antianginal efficacy of nifedipine GITS with a once-a-day beta-receptor blocker, atenolol. Seventeen patients with documented coronary artery disease and stable stress-induced angina pectoris were studied during a 2-week, single-blind, placebo baseline phase and a 12-week randomized, double-blind, active drug crossover efficacy phase, using the bicycle exercise test and ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings. Patients exercised significantly longer with nifedipine GITS (883 +/- 47 seconds) and atenolol (908 +/- 44 seconds) than with placebo (794 +/- 41 seconds). Nifedipine GITS reduced systolic blood pressure at all stages of exercise compared with placebo but, because heart rate tended to increase more during nifedipine therapy, there was no difference in rate-pressure products between the placebo and nifedipine GITS periods. In contrast, atenolol reduced heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product during exercise compared with placebo. Whereas left ventricular ejection fractions (by radionuclide angiocardiography) increased with exercise, the maximal increase was smaller with atenolol than with placebo and nifedipine. The net increase in left ventricular ejection fraction at the end of exercise was greater with nifedipine than with placebo or atenolol. Ambulatory electrocardiograms showed only a small number of ischemic events. Neither nifedipine GITS nor atenolol reduced the number of ischemic events or total duration of ST-segment deviations significantly. It is concluded that nifedipine GITS is as effective an antianginal agent as atenolol, but the hemodynamic effects of the 2 agents differ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",I,E

Nine were women and 5 were men (mean age 33 +/- 13 years). The resting electrocardiogram showed ventricular preexcitation in 8 patients and normal PR interval in 6. Anterograde and retrograde mapping studies revealed that the accessory pathway was para-Hisian in 11 patients and paranodal in 3. The accessory pathway was successfully ablated in 10 patients (9 para-Hisian and 1 paranodal) and damaged in 1 (para-Hisian).

The drugs were given for 4 weeks. The primary outcome variables were frequency and duration of total ischaemic burden, silent and symptomatic myocardial ischaemia. These were measured on 48 h of Holter monitoring. The reductions in duration and frequency of total ischaemic burden by metoprolol, 76% and 40%, respectively, were significantly higher than by diltiazem, 43% and 24%, respectively (P < 0.01 and P < 0.02). The frequency and duration of silent myocardial ischaemia, which constituted more than 80% of the total ischaemic burden in the two groups showed similar results. However, the reduction in frequency of symptomatic myocardial ischaemia only was significantly greater by metoprolol (63% than diltiazem (24%) as the difference in reduction of duration of symptomatic ischaemia was insignificant (85% vs. 75%; P > 0.05).

The study included 536 general practitioners' practices in England and Wales for the period October 1987 through August 1991. A total of 625,307 persons who received more than 2 million prescriptions for one of 12 NSAIDs were followed up to estimate the risk of newly diagnosed acute liver injury.; There were 23 cases of acute liver injury. The incidence of acute liver injury was 3.7 per 100,000 NSAID users or 1.1 per 100,000 NSAID prescriptions. None of the cases had a fatal outcome. Sulindac was the only NSAID with a substantially greater risk than that for the overall NSAID group. Users of NSAIDs who had rheumatoid arthritis had a 10-fold increased risk of acute liver injury compared with NSAID-treated patients with osteoarthritis. Concomitant exposure to other hepatotoxic medications also increased the risk. Transient minor increases in liver test values were not a useful predictor of diagnosed NSAID-associated acute liver injury.; Although NSAIDs have been found to be associated with acute liver injury in a small number of persons, the risk is sufficiently small as to be of minimal concern for most NSAIDs.",3,E

Renal haemodynamic measurements included effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by radionuclide study using 131I-hippuran and 99mTc, with methods described by Schlegel and Gates, respectively. In addition, effective renal blood flow [ERBF = ERPF/(1-Ht)], filtration fraction (FF = GFR/ERPF) and renal vascular resistance (RVR = MBP x 80/ERBF) were calculated. Plasma renin activity (PRA), serum aldosterone (ALD) and urinary excretion of sodium (NaU) were evaluated. At the end of amlodipine administration a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in SBP, DBP and MBP from baseline values was observed. A significant decrease (P < 0.01) in RVR and significant increases (P < 0.05) in ERPF, ERBF and in NaU were also found, without relevant changes in GFR, FF, PRA and ALD. No significant variation in clinical and renal measurements was observed in the placebo group. No relevant side effects were observed in either group.

In Switzerland a total of 797 patients have been enrolled in the study. Antihypertensive therapy was initiated with felodipine = Plendil (5 mg/day). This vasoelective calcium antagonist could reduce diastolic blood pressure values to < 90 or < 80 mg/Hg, respectively, in one of two or one of three patients within the first three months. In nine or six patients, respectively out of ten a reduction of diastolic blood pressure values to < 90 or < 80 mmHg was reached within one year by combination of felodipine with other antihypertensive drugs (ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and diuretics).",7,E

All three treatment regimens were given to each patient in randomised order for 4 weeks after a 4 week placebo run-in period. Felodipine 10-20 mg daily, metoprolol 100-200 mg daily and the combination of felodipine 10-20 mg plus metoprolol 100 mg daily were all effective antihypertensive treatments both at rest and during exercise. The two drugs seemed to have additive effects and the effect on BP of the combination was greater than that of either drug given as monotherapy. The mean sitting BP was 148/103 mmHg at randomisation, after 4 weeks of placebo treatment, and 134/88, 134/94 and 121/84 mmHg, respectively, after 4 weeks' treatment with felodipine, metoprolol and the combination. Maximal exercise capacity was similar irrespective of treatment regimen, and the normal response to exercise BP and HR was maintained during all active treatments. Changes observed in volume regulatory hormones (PRA, aldosterone and ANP) were consistent with a direct tubular natriuretic-diuretic effect of felodipine and of beta-blocker attenuated release of renin. All treatment regimens were well tolerated and adverse events reported were usually mild and transient.",5,E

Its two main aims are to evaluate the relationship between three levels of target diastolic blood pressure (< or = 90, < or = 85 or < or = 80 mmHg) and the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients and the effects on morbidity and mortality of a low dose, 75 mg daily, of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) compared with placebo. Altogether 19,193 patients have been recruited and randomized and one-year data are now available for all patients. This is a report on the blood pressures achieved, the tolerability and other available data after 12 months of follow-up of all patients. Special reference will be given to the subgroup of elderly patients (> or = 65 years, n = 6,113) as compared to younger patients (< 65 years, n = 13,080). On average, the target group < or = 90 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure has reached 86 mmHg, the target group < or = 85 mmHg has reached 83 mmHg and the target group < or = 80 mmHg has reached 81 mmHg. The percentage of patients that has obtained their target blood pressures is 84% in the target group < or = 90 mmHg, 72% in the target group < or = 85 mmHg and 57% in the target group < or = 80 mmHg at 12 months of follow-up. In the elderly subgroup (> or = 65 years of age) the percentage of patients at target is higher for all target groups, being 86, 76 and 61%, respectively, at 12 months. Antihypertensive treatment is initiated with a calcium antagonist, felodipine, at a dose of 5 mg once daily. If target blood pressure is not reached, additional antihypertensive therapy, with either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, is given. Further dose adjustments are made in accordance with a set protocol. As a fifth and final step a diuretic may be added. Side effects have been relatively few in this large multinational series of intensively treated hypertensive patients. Only ankle edema, 2.6% and 3.0%, and coughing, 1.3% and 0.8%, in young and elderly patients, respectively, exceed a frequency of 1%, and 88% of all patients are still taking their baseline therapy felodipine after one year. The one-year data presented here indicate that it should be possible to fulfill the primary aims of the HOT Study.",I,E

The definition of proarrhythmia has changed since controlled clinical studies showed a dichotomy between arrhythmia suppression and mortality. The nature of proarrhythmic reactions is linked to the electrophysiologic effects of various antiarrhythmic drugs. Whereas Class I agents without accompanying effects on repolarization generally produce ventricular tachycardia (often incessant) or fibrillation, Class III agents typically produce torsades de pointes that may deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation. The precise mechanism of torsades de pointes is not fully elucidated, although early after-depolarization and increases in spatial or temporal dispersion of repolarization are likely possibilities. Proarrhythmic risk is lowest for amiodarone and is probably related to the drug's complex electrophysiologic profile. The incidence of torsades with sotalol increases with dose and the baseline values of the QT interval; the incidence with d-sotalol and other pure Class III agents remains unclear. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate this are under way. The fact that d-sotalol increases mortality in postinfarction patients suggests that it may possibly be a common property of most, if not all, pure Class III compounds. The ongoing clinical trials with various Class III agents are likely to provide the critical information on this important therapeutic issue.",5,E

To assess the effects of low-dose, long-acting verapamil on blood pressure (BP) and quality of life (QOL) in elderly patients, verapamil 120-240 mg of placebo was given once daily for 8 weeks to 76 patients aged > or = 60 years. After a 4-week placebo wash-out period, patients with a sitting DBP of 95-110 mm Hg and a mean daytime (6 am to 6 pm) ambulatory DBP > or = 90 mm Hg were entered into the study. Twenty four-hour BP monitoring as well as QOL self-assessment and digit span testing of cognitive function were performed at the end of the placebo wash-out and double-blind treatment periods. Patients treated with verapamil showed a significant decrease in mean whole-day BP, while those treated with placebo showed a small increase in BP. Treatment differences between the two groups in SBP and DBP were each statistically significant (P < 0.01). Significant differences were also seen when the 24 h period was divided into daytime and night-time readings. Both QOL and digit span testing scores were unchanged from baseline for verapamil-treated patients and were not different from the placebo-treated group.

To find out the effect of the non-dihydropyridine-like calcium-channel blocker diltiazem, a randomised, double-blind trial was conducted comparing diltiazem with glyceryl trinitrate, both given intravenously, in 129 patients with unstable angina. The endpoints were refractory angina or myocardial infarction, individually and as a composite endpoint. Refractory angina alone or together with myocardial infarction occurred significantly less commonly in the diltiazem group. While patients were on the trial drugs the numbers with refractory angina were 6 (10%) in the diltiazem group versus 17 (28%) in the glyceryl trinitrate group (relative risk 0.36, p = 0.02), and the numbers with refractory angina and myocardial infarction were 9 (15%) versus 23 (38%) (relative risk 0.40, p = 0.007). Over 48 h the number were: refractory angina 8 (13%) versus 18 (30%), relative risk 0.45, p = 0.03, and refractory angina and myocardial infarction 12 (20.0%) versus 25 (41%), relative risk 0.49, p = 0.02. Patients in the diltiazem group had better (p < 0.05) event-free survival while taking the drugs. Heart-rate pressure product was reduced significantly only by diltiazem (p < 0.05). The incidence of bradyarrhythmias did not differ significantly. Atrioventricular conduction disturbances occurred in 5 (8%) patients in the diltiazem group but were not seen in the glyceryl trinitrate group (p = 0.03). These disturbances could be reversed by decreasing the dose of the drug or withdrawing it. No temporary pacemakers were required. Headache requiring an analgesic or dose adjustment occurred significantly less in the diltiazem group: 3 (5%) versus 15 (25%), relative risk 0.20 (p < 0.004).

However, it is not clear whether, in individual patients, this combined therapy is more effective than monotherapy.; Two hundred eighty patients with stable angina pectoris were enrolled in a double-blind trial in 25 European centers. Patients were randomized (week 0) to metoprolol (controlled release, 200 mg once daily) or nifedipine (Retard, 20 mg twice daily) for 6 weeks; placebo or the alternative drug was then added for a further 4 weeks. Exercise tests were performed at weeks 0, 6 and 10.; At week 6, both metoprolol and nifedipine increased the mean exercise time to 1-mm ST segment depression in comparison with week 0 (both p < 0.01); metoprolol was more effective than nifedipine (p < 0.05). At week 10, the groups randomized to combination therapy had a further increase in time to 1-mm ST segment depression (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). Analysis of the results in individual patients revealed that 7 (11%) of 63 patients adding nifedipine to metoprolol and 17 (29%) of 59 patients (p < 0.0001) adding metoprolol to nifedipine showed an increase in exercise tolerance that was greater than the 90th percentile of the distribution of the changes observed in the corresponding monotherapy + placebo groups. However, among these patients, an additive effect was observed only in 1 (14%) of the 7 patients treated with metoprolol + nifedipine and in 4 (24%) of the 17 treated with nifedipine + metoprolol.; The mean additive anti-ischemic effect shown by combination therapy with metoprolol and nifedipine in patients with stable angina pectoris is not the result of an additive effect in individual patients. Rather, it may be attributed to the recruitment by the second drug of patients not responding to monotherapy.",I,E

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical effects of intravenous diltiazem (DTZ) or nitroglycerin (NTG) in patients with unstable angina pectoris. We studied 43 patients admitted to the hospital with a history of rest angina within the last 48 hours, associated with EKG evidence of ischemia. All subjects received intravenous heparin and oral aspirin, 23 were randomly assigned to receive intravenous DTZ and 20 to receive intravenous NTG. Both groups had similar baseline features and the endpoints of treatment were recurrence of angina, myocardial infarction, death during hospitalization and secondary side effects. Treatment with DTZ, when compared to NTG, resulted in a significant reduction of recurrent angina (8.7 and 59% respectively; p < 0.005), number of angina episodes per patient (0.18 +/- 0.5 and 0.9 +/- 1.2 respectively; p < 0.05) and lower need for dose increment to control symptoms (3 and 9 patients respectively; p < 0.05). The most common side effects observed were cephalea with NTG (60% of patients) and asymptomatic sinus bradicardia with DTZ (28% of patients). In each group, one patient had a myocardial infarction and one patient died. It is concluded that intravenous DTZ reduces myocardial ischemia to a greater extent than NTG and can be safely used in patients with unstable angina pectoris.",6,E

The sustained release formulation of diltiazem, allowing two daily doses (Bi-Tildiem 120 mg), is already marketed in France for the treatment of stable angina. It was therefore interesting to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this form, administered in two daily doses, in coronary spasm, versus the classical formulation, Tildiem 60 mg, given at the same daily dose, i.e. 240 mg, in three divided doses per day. We conducted a single-centre, randomized, double-blind, cross-over clinical study in twelve patients, eleven men and one woman, between the ages of 42 and 70 years, presenting with angina and normal coronary arteries and spasm documented by a positive methylergonovine (Methergin) test. They were divided into two groups of six patients receiving either Tildiem followed by Bi-Tildiem, or Bi-Tildiem followed by Tildiem. The characteristics of the two groups were comparable at the time of the selection visit. The methylergonovine test, used to assess the efficacy of the two treatments, was improved by Tildiem and Bi-Tildiem compared to the placebo test (p = 0.001 and 0.002), without any significant difference between Tildiem and Bi-Tildiem: an improvement was obtained in 11/12 and 10/12 patients, respectively. No deterioration of the test was observed with Tildiem or Bi-Tildiem compared to placebo. The coronary symptoms and blood diltiazem levels were similar with Tildiem and Bi-Tildiem. The results confirmed the safety of Bi-Tildiem. A single adverse effect was attributed to treatment: an episode of mild insomnia. No serious adverse effect were observed and none of the patients discontinued the study. The efficacy and safety of Tildiem and Bi-Tildiem are comparable in the treatment of spastic angina.",7,E

The study consisted of a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period followed by an 8-week double-blind treatment period. Double-blind treatment began with nifedipine coat-core 30 mg or amlodipine 5 mg. After 4 weeks of double-blind therapy, patients with a trough seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 90 mm Hg received an increased dose of nifedipine coat-core (60 mg) or amlodipine (10 mg). A total of 207 patients received the study medication at 12 private-practice medical centers. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed at six medical centers with 38 nifedipine coat-core and 37 amlodipine patients. Data from 176 patients were valid for the primary efficacy analysis. Treatment groups were well matched with respect to baseline demographic and disease characteristics. During the study period, 59 (65.6%) nifedipine coat-core patients remained on their original 30-mg dose of study medication compared with 52 (60.5%) amlodipine patients who remained on the 5-mg starting dose. Mean trough blood pressure at baseline was 160.9/101.9 mm Hg in the nifedipine coat-core patients compared with 160.5/101.8 mm Hg in the amlodipine patients. Mean trough blood pressures at end point were 141.3/85.5 mm Hg and 140.7/85.9 mm Hg in the nifedipine coat-core and amlodipine groups, respectively. Equivalence between the two treatment groups was demonstrated based on the difference between amlodipine and nifedipine coat-core in the change from baseline in trough seated DBP (90% confidence interval, -0.50 to 2.59). Systolic blood pressure and 24-hour ABPM data supported the equivalent antihypertensive efficacy of the two treatments. Both drugs were well tolerated and had similar safety profiles. Nineteen patients in the amlodipine group experienced at least one adverse event compared with 12 in the nifedipine coat-core group. The amlodipine patients tended toward a later occurrence of adverse events plus a greater number of events, particularly edema and gastrointestinal symptoms.

The international, prospective, randomised HOT study aims at assessing the optimal diastolic BP (DBP) level during active antihypertensive treatment to reduce at the best the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The study is on-going, with a completion of inclusions. The BP measurements are performed by oscillometric method with the D2 international BP device, HESTIA. At enrollment, only 52% of the hypertensives were treated, their mean BP level being 161/99 mmHg +/- 18/9 mmHg (n = 10,005). On randomisation, two weeks after the treatment withdrawal, BP was 170/106 +/- 15/4 mmHg. Six months later, under treatment, BP was 150/84 +/- 10/7 mmHg with a mean decrease of 11/15 mmHg compared to values under previous treatment. Depending on the randomisation groups which are defined by different DBP objectives, 87.5 to 92.2% of the patients have a BP normalisation (DBP < or = 90 mmHg) after one year of treatment. Five explanations may be proposed for the better BP control observed in the study compared to the results at inclusion, reflecting the general practice: (1) the fact that the patient is free to participate and has been informed may have improved the compliance, (2) the patient's follow-up was reinforced during the first weeks, (3) the protocol is based on the treatment initiation by a dihydropyridine with a long duration of action: felodipine, (4) the BP objectives are rigorously defined by a DBP between 80 and 90 mmHg depending on the randomisation group whereas in general practice, the physician may have a smoother objective mainly aiming at improving tolerability, (5) the larger use of a bi-therapy. CONCLUSION. The more ambitious aims of BP control (DBP < or = 90, 85, 80 mmHg) in this study have induced a treatment intensification with a better BP control.",5,E

Pharmacological blood pressure reduction, as a neurovegetative stimulus, can change the arousal of the sympathetic nervous system. We evaluated the effects of two calcium channel blockers, verapamil and amlodipine, both administered as monotherapies, upon the sympathetic stress response in 23 randomized mild-to-moderate essential hypertensives (161 +/- 2/98 +/- 1 mmHg). Patients performed four stress tests (mental arithmetic, colour word Stroop, cold pressor and handgrip) while extracardiovascular and haemodynamic functions were assessed non-invasively at every heart beat, during baseline, stress and recovery phases. The sympathetic response was evaluated by computing the 'area-under-the-curve' (value x time) measured during the psychophysiological session. The session was repeated at run-in, after placebo and during treatment. After one month's treatment, baseline blood pressure was significantly reduced in patients treated with amlodipine (139 +/- 1/84 +/- 1 mmHg; P < 0.001) and verapamil (140 +/- 2/85 +/- 1 mmHg; P < 0.001). The emotional arousal (frontalis muscular contraction, skin conductance) was unchanged, but the cutaneous vascular response was reduced (P < 0.05) in patients treated with verapamil. No changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure were detectable, but amlodipine increased the heart rate response (P < 0.05). In contrast, verapamil reduced the heart rate (P < 0.05) without depressing the cardiac output response, which was increased with amlodipine (P < 0.05). Total vascular resistance was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced with both the treatments. Consequently, functional cardiac load, expressed by pressure-rate product and cardiac power, was significantly enhanced with amlodipine and reduced with verapamil. In conclusion, the abnormal sympathetic stress response, which characterizes the hypertensive patient, might be affected by the choice of medication. Verapamil in particular, moderated emotional arousal, the vasoconstrictive response and reduced cardiac load without lowering cardiac output demands. In contrast, in patients treated with amlodipine, in whom the cardiac output response was increased, the pattern was reversed and the functional cardiac load was also increased.",5,E

Patients with LVH were more likely to have a higher baseline systolic BP (SBP) and DBP. Their sitting SBP and DBP decreased significantly from a mean of 163/102 mm Hg at baseline to 139/86 mm Hg with amlodipine therapy at week 18 (p < 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",5,E

Follow-up lasted for 1 year.; A composite outcome of the following measures was used to define success: attendance at the 12-month visit; at least nine supine DBP measurements during the study; and median supine DBP < 90 mmHg and a reduction of at least 10 mmHg compared with the baseline value. Failure was defined as one or more of those criteria not being fulfilled. Equivalence was concluded if the 95% confidence interval for the success rates differed between two groups by less than +/- 10%. Clinical safety and subjective quality of life were also assessed.; No statistically significant differences in the change in DBP or systolic blood pressure were observed between the groups. The success rates were 43.9, 42.0, 32.5 and 43.9% in diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium antagonist and ACE inhibitor groups, respectively. Equivalence between the treatments could not be concluded, although analysis with a larger equivalence interval showed that some comparisons indicated equivalence. Significant improvement in satisfaction was observed for certain items for subjective quality of life at 1 month in the calcium antagonist treatment group, and significant differences in the responses to the clinical safety questionnaire were observed after 1-month follow-up in calcium antagonist and beta-blocker groups. Differences were no longer significant after 9 months.; These results do not provide evidence on the basis of efficacy of blood pressure lowering or ability to increase short-term (1-year) safety and quality of life favouring any particular treatment among the studied drugs for newly diagnosed patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.",I,I

In 83 and 79 patients, respectively, lisinopril and slow-release nifedipine produced similar reductions in blood pressure (systolic/diastolic: -16/-13 mmHg supine and -14/-11 mmHg standing after lisinopril; -15/-12 mmHg supine and -14/-11 mmHg standing nifedipine). Fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin and plasma lipids appeared to be unaffected by either agent. Also, 28% of the patients on lisinopril and 30% of those on nifedipine presented microalbuminuria. Both drugs induced a reduction in the albumin excretion rate (AER). The geometric mean x:tolerance factor of the reduction in AER among the 23 microalbuminuric patients on lisinopril (-10.0 x:1.3 micrograms/min) was greater, though not significantly so, than that observed in the 26 on nifedipine (-0.9 x 1.2 micrograms/min). Moreover, lisinopril appeared to be better tolerated than nifedipine in our study population. Microalbuminuria is an important risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients as well as in the general population. To what extent a reduction in the AER could ameliorate diabetic patients is, at present, unknown. Finally, both lisinopril and nifedipine showed a similar antihypertensive effect in these patients which was not associated with significant differences in plasma glucose, insulin or lipid concentrations. The clinical consequences of the insignificant differences in AER remain unclear.",5,E

Effectiveness or efficancy of ritodrine has not yet convincingly been proven. A major concern are the marked side effects of beta-mimetics. The calcium channel blocker nifedipine has been used for tocolysis shortly after its introduction in clinical practice and is considered to be a probable good alternative for ritodrine. The efficacy of nifedipine versus ritodrine in the treatment of preterm labor was assessed in a retrospective study. 32 patients received intravenous ritodrine and 29 oral nifedipine. As endpoints were used: postponement of delivery, maternal side effects and perinatal outcome. The results of this retrospective study suggest that nifedipine is more successful in postponing delivery than ritodrine. Maternal side effects seemed to occur more frequently and be more serious in patients treated with ritodrine as compared to nifedipine. Perinatal outcome seemed better in the nifedipine group than in the ritodrine group. The promising data from small prospective studies and the results of this retrospective study warrant further large prospective studies on the definitive place of nifedipine in the treatment of premature labor. Until the results of such a trial are available we advocate the use of nifedipine in case of preterm labor, especially in a patient with diabetes mellitus, ruptured membranes, cardiac disease or multiple pregnancy, in order to avoid the characteristic side effects of beta-mimetics.",4,E

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the lipid-lowering drug gemfibrozil on retinoid-associated hyperlipidemia, we studied the clinical response and the plasma lipoprotein levels in 22 acitretin-treated (0.25-0.75 mg/kg) patients mainly suffering from psoriasis. Gemfibrozil or placebo was given in a double-blind cross-over fashion to 14 patients, who after 8 weeks of acitretin therapy and dietary advice exhibited hyperlipidemia (triglyceride levels > or = 50% above baseline and/or > or = 2.0 mmol/l). Serum triglycerides remained high (3.7 +/- 2.4 mmol/l) during placebo treatment but were reduced after 8 weeks of gemfibrozil treatment (p < 0.01). The total cholesterol level decreased slightly (p < 0.05) during gemfibrozil treatment, but the LDL/HDL ratio did not change significantly. No untoward effects of gemfibrozil on acitretin dose-response and clinical side-effects were noted. Gemfibrozil thus appears useful in patients prone to retinoid-induced hyperlipidemia unresponsive to dietary treatment and acitretin dose reductions.",6,E

The degree of weight loss with fat-modified diet and exercise was significantly related to favorable lipid changes. Significant differences (P<.01) among groups for average changes during follow-up in each lipid were observed. Decreases in plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were greater with doxazosin and acebutolol (for plasma total cholesterol, 0.36 and 0.30 mmol/L [13.8 and 11.7 mg/dL], respectively), less with chlorthalidone and placebo (0.12 and 0.13 mmol/L [4.5 and 5.1 mg/dL], respectively). Decreases in triglycerides were greater with doxazosin and enalapril, least with acebutolol. Increases in HDL cholesterol were greater with enalapril and doxazosin, least with acebutolol. Significant relative increases in plasma total cholesterol with chlorthalidone compared with placebo at 12 months were no longer present at 24 months and beyond, when mean plasma total cholesterol for the chlorthalidone group fell below baseline. Analyses of participants continuing to receive chlorthalidone throughout the 4 years of follow-up indicated this was not due solely to an increasing percentage of participants changing or discontinuing use of medication during follow-up.; - Weight loss with a fat-modified diet plus increased exercise produces favorable long-term effects on blood pressure and all plasma lipid fractions of adults with stage I hypertension; blood pressure reduction is enhanced to a similar degree by addition of a drug from any one of 5 classes of antihypertensive medication. These drugs differ quantitatively in influencing the degree of long-term favorable effects on blood lipids obtained with nutritional-hygienic treatment.",5,E

The combination therapy also resulted in a greater percentage of patients having successful clinical response in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure. The amlodipine and benazepril regimen was also shown to be associated with a similar incidence of adverse experiences as the active monotherapy or placebo regimens, although the group given combination therapy appeared to have a lower incidence of edema than the group given amlodipine alone.

Nevertheless, the management of patients with CHF remains a therapeutic challenge. The second Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT II) showed that the average 2-year mortality with enalapril (18%) was significantly lower than that with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (25%) but, somewhat surprisingly, the nonspecific vasodilators produced significantly more improvement in exercise performance and left ventricular function. Such data suggest that improvement in symptoms, hemodynamics, and survival may not be afforded by the use of a single class of vasodilator therapy, but might be optimized by the combined use of different agents. This report describes the rationale and design of V-HeFT III, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the effects of chronic oral extended-release felodipine (felodipine ER) 2.5 to 5 mg twice daily, when added to a stable regimen of enalapril and loop diuretics, with or without digoxin, on exercise performance, morbidity, and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to III CHF followed for a minimum of 12 weeks. Felodipine is a second-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of vascular selectivity which, in the doses used in this study, exerts its systemic arterial effect by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance without producing negative inotropic effects. The results of V-HeFT III may shed important light on the role of additive vasodilator therapy in the management of patients with CHF.",I,I

Evaluation of AWS symptoms was performed at baseline and after 3, 7, 14 days using Sandowal-Wang scale. Our original scales (37 items) were designed for measuring the depth of dependence (WGU) and the velocity of dependence syndrome appearance (WWO). The results show that both groups were similar regarding WGU and WWO before treatment. Both drugs caused an improvement of AWS symptoms after 3 and 7 days lasting till the end of hospitalization. Nifedipine was well tolerated and no side effects were observed or reported. The group and multidimensional analyses were performed using original computer program. The patients were divided into 3 subgroups. Comparison of mean values of improvement index between both drugs in those subgroups of patients according to WGU criteria, revealed that nifedipine was more effective on the 3-rd and 7-th day in 3 groups and 2 groups resp. According to WWO criteria the improvement index was significantly higher on the 3-rd and 7-th day in two groups whereas in one group chlordiazepoxide and nifedipine action was equal. The proposed method of group and multidimensional analysis enable us to compare the effectiveness of different kinds of AWS treatment.

The sex difference in BP response could not be fully explained by differences in age, weight, dose (mg/kg), race, baseline BP, or compliance, and there were no differences among women based on use of hormone replacement therapy. Amlodipine was well tolerated; mild to moderate edema was the most common adverse effect. Thus, amlodipine was effective and safe as once-a-day monotherapy in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in a community-based population.

A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, three-way cross-over study design was used.; Twenty-four patients with a supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95-115 mmHg after a 4-week placebo run-in period were given FER 5 mg 9 mm tablets, FER 5 mg 11 mm tablets and placebo in randomised order. The tablets were given once daily and each double-blind treatment period lasted for two weeks.; Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed at the end of each treatment period. The primary effect variable was mean DBP over 24 hours. Nineteen patients had 24-hour blood pressure data valid for analysis using an analysis of variance with patient, treatment, period and carry-over as factors.; Both formulations of FER 5 mg tablets significantly reduced the mean 24-hour DBP compared to placebo. The 9 and 11 mm tablets resulted in, on average, 4.7 and 3.4 mmHg lower mean 24-hour DBP than placebo. There was, however, no significant difference between the two different FER formulations. Both FER formulations were well tolerated and similar to placebo in this respect.; Both FER 5 mg tablet formulations (9 and 11 mm diameter), given once daily, were clinically equivalent with respect to antihypertensive effect and tolerability in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.",5,E

This study was designed to evaluate the responses to three stressors and to determine if once-daily sustained release verapamil (Verelan) modified these responses. We studied 13 patients with mild to moderate hypertension in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. After 4 weeks of therapy, patients were evaluated following assumption of the upright posture, mental stress, and cold pressor test. During placebo, the stressors produced an increase in systolic pressure (144 +/- 2 to 167 +/- 3 mmHg, p < 0.001), heart rate (70 +/- 2 to 77 +/- 2 beats/ min, p < 0.001), and platelet aggregability to adenosine diphosphate (threshold concentration fell from 2.8 +/- 0.4 to 1.9 +/- 0.1 microM, p = 0.05) and epinephrine (3.4 +/- 0.9 to 1.6 +/- 0.6 microM, p < 0.001). Verapamil lowered systolic pressure at baseline (144 +/- 2 to 134 +/- 2 mmHg, p < 0.001), and after stress (167 +/- 3 to 154 +/- 3 mmHg, p < 0.001), but did not alter the absolute increase with stress. During verapamil, platelet reactivity did not increase with stress, and the post-stress response to epinephrine was reduced (higher threshold concentration) compared with placebo (3.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.3 microM, p = 0.05). Verapamil also reduced the response to collagen (increased lag time) at baseline and after stress (111 +/- 9 vs. 91 +/- 3 s, p < 0.01). We conclude that verapamil blunted potentially harmful stress-induced hemodynamic and hemostatic changes. Further studies are required to determine whether these effects translate into a lower incidence of acute cardiovascular events.",5,E

In this study, we compared blood pressure reductions using nifedipine alone, nifedipine plus diltiazem, and nifedipine plus verapamil and determined whether combinations alter nifedipine pharmacokinetics. After determination of baseline blood pressures. 16 subjects with essential hypertension (12 men, 4 women; mean age, 48 years) received 30 mg/d open-label, sustained release nifedipine for 2 weeks. If still hypertensive (n = 16), they were randomized (double-blind) to receive either additional sustained release diltiazem or sustained release verapamil, both 180 mg/d, for 2 weeks and were then crossed-over for the final 2 weeks of the study. All medications were once-daily, extended-release formulations. Blood pressures and nifedipine plasma concentrations were measured during the final day of each treatment. Overall, each combination lowered mean systolic and diastolic pressures more than nifedipine alone. Mean supine diastolic pressures were significantly lower at 8 hours (77.6 versus 84.6 mm Hg, P = .001) and 12 hours (81.5 versus 87.1 mm Hg, P = .04) with nifedipine plus diltiazem than nifedipine plus verapamil. Mean nifedipine concentrations were inversely correlated with mean blood pressures. Mean nifedipine area under the curve values were greater with diltiazem than verapamil (1430 versus 1134 ng.h/mL, P = .026), with each greater than nifedipine alone (957 ng.h/mL). Nifedipine plus diltiazem had a greater antihypertensive effect than nifedipine plus verapamil. Diltiazem caused greater increases in nifedipine plasma concentrations than did verapamil. These data suggest that combined calcium channel blockers result in additive antihypertensive effects, perhaps because of a pharmacokinetic interaction.",5,E

An hypothesis emerge that bipolar illness arise from disorders in calcium-regulated functions. Given this hypothesis, some authors propose to describe the common profiles of action of the different mood-stabilizers: all the neural mechanisms that are hypothesized to explain various psychopharmacological treatments of bipolar illness involve functions that are critically controlled by calcium. Moreover, in every instance, a known action of lithium on calcium-dependent processes could account for lithium's prophylactic results. Similarities exist between the action of lithium and calcium antagonists like verapamil and nimodipine. From these considerations the hypothesis emerge that calcium antagonists could be an alternative pharmacological agent in the maintenance treatment of bipolar illness. Calcium antagonists have been found useful in this indication by a number of investigators. Given the safety and relative lack of side effects of calcium channel blocking agents, their potential efficacy in mood disorders, it is concluded that calcium antagonists may be an alternative choice in prophylactic treatment for bipolar illness, especially in patients who cannot be treated with lithium or carbamazepine. There is evidence for using verapamil at 240 to 320 mg a day, in 2 to 4 times. Some studies suggest that the association of lithium with calcium antagonist resulted more effective than lithium alone or calcium antagonist alone in the reduction of episodes of affective disorders. However, concomitant administration of a calcium channel antagonist and lithium present adverse interactions (lithium toxicity, cardiovascular accidents), probably because of synergistic toxic effects. Therefore, authors advise care in monitoring patients receiving the combination of these medications.",1,E

Results have been disparate, with evidence of possible harm, no effect, or some benefit, depending on the agent used. We evaluated how the evidence from these trials has influenced the pattern of prescription of calcium antagonists and assessed the important determinants of use of these agents in patients after AMI. We analyzed retrospectively the prescription of calcium antagonists at discharge in all patients recovering from AMI enrolled in 3 large randomized clinical trials (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell' Infarto-1 [GISSI-1], GISSI-2, and GISSI-3) during the last 10 years.

The presence of post AMI angina, history of hypertension, and occurrence of reinfarction were associated with a higher usage of calcium antagonists, whereas the use of beta blockers at discharge was a major independent negative determinant. Use of calcium antagonists for secondary prevention after AMI (i.e., without specific clinical indications for their use) decreased by approximately 60% (from 26.1% to 10.3%). The data indicate that the usage of calcium antagonists in GISSI studies has been strongly affected by the results of other large multicenter trials evaluating calcium antagonists.

Both amlodipine and diltiazem caused stable, persistent BP reduction over 24 hours with no evidence for a ""peak"" effect. For a similar decrease in diastolic BP, amlodipine caused a significantly larger decrease in systolic BP. Amlodipine decreased BP by lowering total peripheral resistance, whereas diltiazem caused small decreases in both total peripheral resistance and cardiac index. Both calcium antagonists caused modest but significant decreases in supine and standing plasma catecholamines. LV wall thickness and LV mass decreased significantly over the 6 months of follow-up: -6 +/- 2 with diltiazem and -10 +/- 2 g/m2 with amlodipine. In patients taking amlodipine, the decrease in LV mass correlated significantly with the decrease in plasma norepinephrine. In contrast to rapid-acting calcium antagonists, both amlodipine and diltiazem-SR cause smooth BP control and an appropriate decrease in LV mass without activation of the sympathetic nervous system.",5,E

Thirty patients, 23 men and 7 women, aged 37-70 years (mean 53 +/- 9 years) participated in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study of felodipine 10 mg ER versus placebo. An ambulatory daytime diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 mm Hg at the end of a 4-week run-in period was necessary to enter the 10-week treatment phase. Twenty-nine patients completed the treatment phase. Twenty-two underwent a 2-day single-blind placebo follow-up to assess residual drug effects. All patients underwent ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) by Spacelabs 90207 recorders. Recorders were programmed to make automatic BP and heart rate (HR) measurements every 15 min throughout the 24 h. Felodipine 10 mg ER significantly (p < 0.01) reduced ambulatory systolic BP (SBP) and DBP values throughout the 24-h, day (7 a.m. to 11 p.m.) and night (11 p.m. to 7 a.m.) periods, but not influencing average ambulatory HR values. Trough-to-peak (T/P) ratios, calculated on the average ambulatory BP values measured in the 7-9 a.m. 2-h interval of the second day of ABPM (before the new drug administration: trough) and in the 10 a.m. to 12 noon 2-h interval of the first day of ABPM (peak BP-lowering effect), were 0.71 and 0.58 for SBP and DBP, respectively. Individual T/P calculations, after post hoc selection of nonresponders, gave superimposable results, the consistency of which was judged on mean, median, and confidence intervals (CI). However, the wide variability of the individual T/P ratios suggests that this method cannot be the only means to evaluate the duration of action of an antihypertensive drug by ABPM. The long-acting BP-lowering drug effect was clearly shown by the ABPM performed in the follow-up when SBP and DBP average values of the 24-h, day, and night periods were still reduced. Felodipine 10 mg ER effectively reduced BP in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, showing prolonged duration of its antihypertensive action beyond the time of the next dose.",5,E

Each treatment period lasted three months. The blood pressure was similar irrespective of treatment. Blood glucose values were not significantly different during the oral glucose tolerance test. Serum insulin levels after glucose administration were lower when the patients were treated with felodipine than when taking hydrochlorothiazide. A possible explanation for this observation may be an increased insulin release as a consequence of treatment with a diuretic in order to maintain normal blood glucose levels during the glucose tolerance test.

To assess blood pressure (BP) control and adverse side effects associated with a switch of patients on nifedipine GITS to felodipine at our Veteran's Administration Medical Center (VAMC), we prospectively studied physician records and patient-reported side effects (both from the medical record and patient questionnaires) in 127 hypertensive patients (70 +/- 10 years, 95% men, 88% nonblack, 44% with coronary disease) who underwent the forced switch in therapy. During the period of patient visits/chart review, physicians were unaware that the study was being conducted. A minimum of 2 months and two visits on each therapy was required for patient inclusion. The mean doses of nifedipine GITS and felodipine used were 55 +/- 24 mg/day and 8 +/- 2.6 mg/day, respectively. The use of supplemental antihypertensive agents was similar in both calcium channel blocker groups. Systolic BPs and heart rates were similar in patients taking the two drugs, and the diastolic BP was modestly lower in patients taking felodipine (78 +/- 10 mm Hg for felodipine and 80 +/- 10 mm Hg for nifedipine, P < .05). There were no differences in the incidence of side effects (both patient-reported and provider-reported) for the two antihypertensive therapies. These data demonstrate that in an hypertensive population followed in a VAMC, mandatory switching of stable dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker therapy did not result in any significant changes in short-term (2 to 3 months) BP control nor were adverse side effects different based on both physician- and patient- reported sources of information.",I,6

Will lowering LDL cholesterol in moderately hypercholesterolemic older individuals reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and total mortality? These important medical practice and public health questions are to be addressed by the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind trial in 40,000 high-risk hypertensive patients. ALLHAT is designed to determine whether the combined incidence of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and nonfatal myocardial infarction differs between persons randomized to diuretic (chlorthalidone) treatment and each of three alternative treatments--a calcium antagonist (amlodipine), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), and an alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin). ALLHAT also contains a randomized, open-label, lipid-lowering trial designed to determine whether lowering LDL cholesterol in 20,000 moderately hypercholesterolemic patients (a subset of the 40,000) with a 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, will reduce all-cause mortality compared to a control group receiving ""usual care."" ALLHAT's main eligibility criteria are: 1) age 55 or older; 2) systolic or diastolic hypertension; and 3) one or more additional risk factors for heart attack (eg, evidence of atherosclerotic disease or type II diabetes). For the lipid-lowering trial, participants must have an LDL cholesterol of 120 to 189 mg/dL (100 to 129 mg/dL for those with known CHD) and a triglyceride level below 350 mg/dL. The mean duration of treatment and follow-up is planned to be 6 years.

Data were obtained for SVT patients treated in a metropolitan, fire-department-based paramedic system serving a population of approximately 1 million persons. Standard drug protocols were used and patient outcomes (i.e., conversion rates, complications, and recurrences) were monitored.; During the adenosine treatment period, 105 patients had SVT; 87 (83%) received adenosine, of whom 60 (69%) converted to a sinus rhythm (SR). Vagal maneuvers (VM) resulted in restoration of SR in 8 patients (7.6%). Some patients received adenosine for non-SVT rhythms: 7 sinus tachycardia, 18 atrial fibrilation, 7 wide-complex tachycardia (WCT), and 2 ventricular tachycardia; no non-SVT rhythm converted to SR and none of these patients experienced an adverse effect. Twenty-five patients were hemodynamically unstable (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), with 20 receiving drug and 13 converting to SR; 8 patients required electrical cardioversion. Four patients experienced adverse effects related to adenosine (chest pain dyspnea, prolonged bradycardia, and ventricular tachycardia). In the verapamil period, 106 patients had SVT: 52 (49%) received verapamil (p < 0.001, compared with the adenosine period), of whom 43 (88%) converted to SR (p = 0.11). Two patients received verapamil for WCT; neither converted to SR and both experienced cardiovascular collapse. VM resulted in restoration of SR in 12 patients (11.0%) (p = 0.52). Sixteen patients were hemodynamically unstable, with 5 receiving drug (p = 0.005) and 5 converting to SR; 9 patients required electrical cardioversion (p = 0.48). Four patients experienced adverse effects related to verapamil (hypotension ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation). Recurrence of SVT was noted in 2 adenosine patients and 2 verapamil patients in the out-of-hospital setting and in 23 adenosine patients and 15 verapamil patients after ED arrival, necessitating additional therapy (p = 0.48 and 0.88, for recurrence rates and types of additional therapies, respectively). Hospital diagnoses, outcomes, and ED dispositions were similar for the 2 groups.; Adenosine and verapamil were equally successful in converting out-of-hospital SVT in patients with similar etiologies responsible for the SVT. Recurrence of SVT occurred at similar rates for the 2 medications. Rhythm misidentification remains a common issue in out-of-hospital cardiac care in this emergency medical services system.",6,E

We have studied the influence of salt intake on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (Creatinine Clearance) in 14 patients with mild hypertension. Each patient was studied in random order and according to a crossover design, at habitual salt intake, at high salt intake (ie habitual +50/100 mmol/day) and at low salt intake (habitual -50/100 mmol/day). Protein, calcium and potassium intake was fixed across the three study periods. The control group was formed by seven healthy subjects. High salt intake, caused a significant (P < 0.01) increase in 24 h mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the expected suppression in plasma renin activity (PRA) and in plasma aldosterone. Seven patients were classified as salt-sensitive. The GFR was significantly higher (P < 0.01) at high salt intake (125 +/- 10 ml/min) than at habitual (113 +/- 7 ml/min) and at low salt intake (97 +/- 6 ml/min). On aggregate urinary salt excretion was significantly related with the GFR (P < 0.01 by correlation analysis for repeated observations) and the slope of this relationship predicted that a 100 mmol/day increase in salt intake is associated with the 14.6 ml/min rise in the GFR. The relationship between GFR and 24 h urinary salt in salt sensitive patients did not differ from that in salt resistant patients. The GFR response to salt loading was largely independent of the renin-aldosterone system. No change in arterial pressure nor in GFR was observed in healthy subjects. At fixed protein intake, changes in salt intake in the physiological range are associated with important GFR variations in mild hypertensives. As long as hyperfiltration in mild hypertension is a predictor of renal function deterioration, high salt intake, independent of the effect of arterial pressure, could be a factor that contributes to nephronic obsolescence in patients with essential hypertension.",I,I

They all had a history of clinically stable type II diabetes > 3 months, microalbuminuria and early diabetic nephropathy (a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate ranging from 20 to 300 micrograms/min) and a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90-100 mm Hg (Korotkoff phase V) inclusive at both entry and after 3-4 weeks' placebo treatment. The aim of treatment was to achieve a reduction in sitting DBP to < 90 mm Hg 24-30 h after the last dose of lisinopril or 12-18 hours after the last dose of nifedipine and to evaluate the effect of these treatments on UAE over 12 months. The effect of the two treatments on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) was also evaluated in a subset of patients. Management of diabetes with oral hypoglycaemic drugs, diet and insulin alone or in combination was permitted. Median UAE fell on lisinopril from 65.5 (range 20-297) micrograms/min at baseline to 39.0 (2-510) micrograms/min after 12 months. On nifedipine median UAE fell from 63.0 (range 20-289) micrograms/min at baseline to 58.0 (9-1192) micrograms/min after 12 months. The estimated median difference between the effects of the two treatments was 20 micrograms/min (P = 0.0006). Over 12 months both treatments produced similar falls in sitting BP from 163 +/- 17/99 +/- 6 mm Hg (mean +/- s.d.) to 147 +/- 18/88 +/- 10 mm Hg for lisinopril and from 161 +/- 18/97 +/- 5 mm Hg to 150 +/- 18/88 +/- 9 mm Hg for nifedipine. Ambulatory BP was assessed in a subset of patients and using areas under the BP-time curve (AUC) a comparison of the effects of the two treatments showed no between-treatment differences. Creatinine clearance, glycaemic control (HbA1c) and lipid profiles did not change significantly during either treatment. Frequency of withdrawals and adverse events were similar for both treatments. We conclude that lisinopril has a significantly more beneficial effect on UAE than nifedipine despite similar effects on both BP and glycaemic control in type II diabetic patients with hypertension.",5,E

Twenty-three patients aged 65-84 completed a study in which they received placebo, felodipine 2.5 mg once daily, felodipine 2.5 mg 12-hourly, and felodipine 5 mg once daily in a randomized, double-blind crossover design. BP response was assessed in the clinic 24 h after medication and by 24 h ambulatory monitoring. The trough/peak ratio was defined as the fall in BP in the 23rd and 24th hour post dose divided by the fall in BP in the 3rd and 4th hour post dose. BP fell with all three regimes and the clinic BPs did not differ from each other but were lower than placebo. Peak BP responses from the ambulatory BP monitor recording were similar with each dose but a greater percentage of the effect was maintained prior to the morning dose with 2.5 mg 12 hourly and 5 mg once daily. Felodipine 2.5 mg once daily reduces BP and in some people this effect persists for 24 h. However if this dose is used BP should be measured prior to the dose of the drug to ensure that 24 h control is maintained. Felodipine 5 mg once daily and felodipine 2.5 mg b.d. were equally effective at maintaining control and there was no significant advantage in using the twice daily regime. If felodipine 5 mg once daily or higher doses are used BP can be titrated post dose with the knowledge that more than 75% of the effect will still be present prior to the next dose of the drug. Thus once daily felodipine extended release (ER) 5 mg or more can be used effectively to maintain BP control over 24 h in clinical practice. In some elderly patients felodipine ER 2.5 mg once daily is an adequate regime.",5,E

The patients were randomly selected to treatment with amlodipine or metoprolol. The anti-hypertensive therapy was switched after 4 months. Haemorheological and haemodynamic variables were measured with rotational viscometry and impedance cardiography, respectively. Fifteen and 16 patients could be evaluated after amlodipine or metoprolol treatment respectively. The mean blood pressure (BP) decreased from 159 +/- 22/105 +/- 7 to 139 +/- 21/91 +/- 6 mm Hg on amlodipine and from 162 +/- 22/104 +/- 5 to 145 +/- 24/90 +/- 8 mm Hg on metoprolol therapy. After amlodipine treatment, the total peripheral resistance index decreased whereas metoprolol treatment was accompanied by a decrease in the cardiac index. Decreases in whole blood viscosity, haematocrit and serum erythropoietin were found after amlodipine as well as metoprolol treatment. After amlodipine the plasma viscosity decreased and the erythrocyte deformability increased in the majority of patients. Plasma fibrinogen decreased after metoprolol treatment. Despite the differences in haemodynamic mechanisms underlying the decrease in BP, amlodipine and metoprolol exert beneficial effects on blood viscosity. Haemodilution and a decrease in serum erythropoietin may be factors underlying this decrease in blood viscosity.",5,E

This randomized, crossover study was designed to compare the long-term anti-ischaemic effects of oral L-propionylcarnitine with diltiazem in patients with stable, exercise-induced angina. After a 2-week washout phase of anti-anginal medication and a 2-week single-blind placebo period, 46 patients were included in the study, 23 of whom received 1500 mg L-propionylcarnitine daily for 6 weeks, and 23 diltiazem (180 mg daily for 3 weeks, followed by 360 mg daily for 3 weeks), crossing over to the other treatment after a 1-week washout period. Three patients on L-propionylcarnitine and two on diltiazem discontinued. Both treatments resulted in comparable exercise duration (582 +/- 35 s and 588 +/- 33 s, mean +/- SEM), time to 0.1 mV ST depression (436 +/- 38 s and 465 +/- 36 s), and increase in time to 0.1 mV ST depression from baseline (20% and 28%), L-propionylcarnitine and diltiazem, respectively. Diltiazem decreased the rate-pressure product at rest and exercise, L-propionylcarnitine did not. Both compounds significantly reduced ST depression at maximal exercise [23% (L-propionylcarnitine) vs 35% (diltiazem), P < 0.05 diltiazem vs L-propionylcarnitine]. Diltiazem increased the time to onset of angina by 22%. In contrast, no significant changes occurred with L-propionylcarnitine. During the study, anginal attacks were reduced by 70% and 57%, and nitroglycerin consumption decreased by 57% and 70%, L-propionylcarnitine and diltiazem, respectively. Thus, both L-propionylcarnitine and (high-dose) diltiazem result in anti-ischaemic effects and decrease anginal attacks in daily life. Although the effect of diltiazem on exercise-induced ischaemia appears more pronounced than that of L-propionylcarnitine, this novel metabolic approach to ischaemia warrants further development.",I,E

However, the difference was not large enough to lead to a difference either in the number of controlled patients or in the decrease in blood pressure. Reducing the number of daily doses does not automatically lead to greater efficacy of treatment.",5,E

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of long acting slow release oral (SRO) Isradipine (5 mg) compared to a placebo in 30 coronary patients with stable chronic angina, randomized in a double blind-fashion. The following parameters were obtained at rest and during submaximal exercise: left and right ventricular (LV, RV) ejection fractions (EF; %) and peak filling rate (PFR; EDV/s), assessed by gated radionuclide angiography, clinical symptoms, electrocardiograms (ECG, ST segment depression; mm), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP; mm Hg). Patients were then given two oral doses of either Isradipine or placebo (one a day). The same parameters were reassessed, at rest and during n equivalent exercise, 48 hours later (24 hours after the last administration of the drug). The results after Isradipine (n = 14) showed, at rest, a significant increase in LVEF and Pfr (51 +/- 9 to 54 +/- 8 and 1.97 +/- 0.44 to 2.36 +/- 0.71, respectively) and a decrease in DBP (93 +/- 11 to 87 +/- 13); and during exercise, a significant increase in LVEF (51 +/- 11 tot 55 +/- 13) and a decrease in ST segment depression (2.3 +/- 1.9 tot 1.9 +/- 1.6). No significant change was observed after placebo in the other 16 patients. We conclude that even 24 hours after an oral administration, Isradipine SRO maintains its beneficial effects both, at rest on LV systolic and diastolic function and pressure, and during exercise on ECG signs of ischemia with improvement in LV ejection fraction.",5,E

But there has not been a study including patients with impaired left ventricular function and evaluating whether the beneficial effects of medication will be maintained during a follow-up period.; The purpose of this study was three-fold: (1) to compare the efficacy of digoxin with low-dose diltiazem and digoxin with low-dose betaxolol on randomized crossover study; (2) to evaluate whether the beneficial effects of medication will be maintained after 7 months; (3) to evaluate the safety of the combination therapy in patients with impaired left ventricular function.; We did a prospective randomized crossover study in 35 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) including 15 patients with left ventricular dysfunction. After enrollment, each patient was evaluated for heart rate, blood pressure, rate-pressure products, maximal exercise tolerance at rest and during symptom-limited treadmill test before medication, at 4 weeks after medication of digoxin (0.125-0.5 mg daily) with diltiazem (90 mg twice daily), and at 4 weeks after digoxin with betaxolol (20 mg once daily). We performed 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) in 15 patients at the end of each phase of treatment. We repeated symptom-limited treadmill test like above method in 15 patients at 7 months of medication.; (1) Ventricular rates were significantly reduced in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol therapy at rest and during exercise (67 +/- 3, 135 +/- 5 (mean +/- S.E.M.) beats/min, respectively) in comparison to digoxin with low-dose diltiazem therapy (80 +/- 7, 154 +/- 5) (P < 0.05). (2) Rate-pressure products were significantly less in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol at rest and during exercise (85 +/- 4, 213 +/- 12 x 10(2) mmHg/min) than in digoxin with low-dose diltiazem therapy (105 +/- 6, 269 +/- 12) (P < 0.05). (3) Exercise capacity was significantly improved in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol (9.3 +/- 0.5 METS) or digoxin with low-dose diltiazem (9.7 +/- 0.5) in comparison to control state (8.3 +/- 0.5) (P < 0.05). (4) At 7 months evaluation, there was no significant difference between at 4 weeks and at 7 months. (5) Results on 24-h ambulatory ECG showed the same findings as on treadmill test. (6) Although side effects occurred more frequently in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol therapy, they were minimal and no patient had to withdraw medication. Worsening of left ventricular dysfunction was not observed.; Our study suggested that (1) combination therapy of low-dose betaxolol with digoxin was more superior to low-dose diltiazem with digoxin in controlling ventricular rate and reducing rate-pressure products; (2) the effects controlling ventricular rate, reducing rate-pressure products and improving exercise capacity have been well maintained even after 7 months of medication with each combination therapy.",I,I

After a placebo run-in period of 1-4 weeks, patients were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups: placebo (n = 48), spirapril 1.5 mg (n = 48), spirapril 3 mg (n = 53), spirapril 6 mg (n = 51) or enalapril 5/10 mg (n = 48). The primary objective was to assess changes in exercise tolerance, and the secondary objective was an assessment of cardiovascular signs and symptoms, quality of life, ejection fraction and chest X-ray findings. Exercise tolerance increased in all groups; however, no statistically significant differences were found between any of the groups. There was a statistically significant reduction of mortality in the pooled spirapril groups compared with placebo, and a trend for reduction of serious cardiovascular adverse events as well as duration of hospitalization. These effects and improvements in lung congestion appeared to be dose dependent. In patients with moderate to severe heart failure, the combination with first-generation calcium channel blockers had an unfavourable effect on exercise capacity and clinical parameters. Spirapril might be an effective alternative to enalapril in the treatment of patients with CHF. The role of the exercise tolerance test in establishing efficacy of ACEIs in CHF and the widespread use of nifedipine in CHF is questioned.",6,E

Of the 545 patients screened, 520 (95.4%) could be followed up. Rates of cardiac and noncardiac death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina and need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were recorded.; A total of 145 events occurred in 120 (23.1%) of 520 patients. Patients with more than six episodes had an event rate of 32.5% compared with 25.0% for patients with two to six episodes and 13.2% for patients with less than two episodes (p < 0.001). Hard events (death, acute myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina pectoris) were more frequent in patients with two or more ischemic episodes (12.2% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.0049). Patients with a 100% response rate of transient ischemic episodes during the TIBBS trial had a 17.5% event rate at 1 year compared with 32.3% for non-100% responders (p = 0.008). Patients receiving bisoprolol during the TIBBS tria had a lower event rate (22.1%) at 1 year than patients randomized to nifedipine (33.1%, p = 0.033).; In patients with stable angina pectoris, frequent episodes of transient ischemia are a marker for an increased event rate. A 100% response to medical treatment reduces the event rate.

We examined whether the long-term use of calcium-channel blockers is associated with an increased risk of cancer.; Between 1988 and 1992 we carried out a prospective cohort study of 5052 people aged 71 years or more and who lived in three regions of Massachusetts, Iowa, and Connecticut USA. Those taking calcium-channel blockers (n = 451) were compared with all other participants (n = 4601). The incidence of cancer was assessed by survey of hospital discharge diagnoses and causes of death. These outcomes were validated by the cancer registry in the one region where it was available. Demographic variables, disability, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, blood pressure, body-mass index, use of other drugs, hospital admissions for other causes, and comorbidity were all assessed as possible confounding factors.; The hazard ratio for cancer associated with calcium-channel blockers (1549 person-years, 47 events) compared with those not taking calcium-channel blockers (17225 person-years, 373 events) was 1.72 (95% CI 1.27-2.34, p = 0.0005), after adjustment for confounding factors. A significant dose-response gradient was found. Hazard ratios associated with verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine did not differ significantly from each other. The results remained unchanged in community-specific analyses. The association between calcium-channel blockers and cancer was found with most of the common cancers.; Calcium-channel blockers were associated with a general increased risk of cancer in the study populations, which suggested a common mechanism.

At the end of each treatment period, blood pressure was measured by using a mercury sphygmomanometer at trough and 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after the last dosing. The peak effect was identified as the maximum decrement induced by the three randomized treatments with respect to the value at the end of the placebo washout period during the 4 h interval. The trough:peak ratios of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were calculated as group ratios and individual ratios from decrements induced by nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system and retard, corrected for those induced by randomized placebo. Patients were defined as responders to each randomized treatment if their diastolic blood pressure at trough time was reduced by at least 10 mmHg relative to that at the corresponding time at the end of placebo washout.; Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system and retard significantly reduced blood pressure to a similar extent both at trough and at peak.

The duration of the trial was 3 months with a 2 week run-in period and 2 week wash-oat period separating two treatment periods of 4 weeks each. A satisfactory response was obtained in 71.4% of migraineurs (p < 0.001) and 28.6% of patients with tension headache (p = N.S). Minor side effects were observed in 5 patients. Nifedipine is a useful agent for the management of migraine as it reduces frequency and severity of pain but the drug cannot be recommended for tension headache.,4,E

There were no significant differences in perioperative characteristics among the patients, who were randomly separated into four groups in the course of discharge. In group 1 (n = 30), patients did not receive antiarrhythmic drugs. Quinidine fumarate was given in group 2 (n = 30), verapimil in group 3 (n = 30), and amiodarone in group 4 (n = 30). Patients were monitored six times over a 90-day postoperative period by 24-hour Holter monitoring and routine examination.; The recurrent atrial fibrillation usually developed within 15 days of discharge. Atrial fibrillation occurred in one patient (3.33%) in group 1, and two each (6.66%) in groups 2, 3, and 4. Atrial fibrillation was asymptomatic and occurred with slow ventricular response in groups 3 and 4. Side effects occurred in 5 patients (16.6%) given quinidine, 1 patient given amiodarone, but in no patient given verapimil.; There were no significant differences in the maintenance of sinus rhythm among the four groups, so we suggest that long-term prevention of atrial fibrillation in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting was not necessary at the postdischarge period.",I,I

Their mean age was 56 +/- 5 years, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.18 +/- 0.05. Patients were treated with diuretics and digoxin only. All were clinically stable and in sinus rhythm. The acute hemodynamic study showed that (intravenous) isradipine increased cardiac index (+36%) and stroke volume index (+30%) (both P < 0.001), while systemic vascular resistance (-33%) and mean arterial pressure (-10%) decreased (both P < 0.005). Filling pressures and heart rate were not affected. Of the 19 patients, 17 completed the 12 week study; 2 patients on placebo (1 death, 1 side-effects) but no patient on isradipine (5 mg 3 times daily) dropped out. After 12 weeks, peak oxygen consumption (VO2), LVEF, echocardiographic indices, and other clinical parameters were unaffected by treatment.

Eighteen patients, mean age 65 +/- 5 years, with Stage I-III diastolic hypertension (sitting diastolic BP between 90 and 115 mm HG) were included in each treatment group. Following a 2 to 8 week placebo washout phase, patients received either nifedipine GITS or HCTZ and were titrated over 5 weeks to achieve a goal diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. Patients were then continued on medication during an 8 week maintenance phase. Treatment effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure was assessed. Serum electrolytes, lipids, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were measured before and after treatment. Posttreatment changes in renal and cardiovascular function, as well as left ventricular mass were evaluated. The results showed significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with both drugs; no treatment difference was found, although goal blood pressure was achieved more rapidly with nifedipine GITS (28 v 34 days, P < .05). BUN was significantly increased only after diuretic therapy (P < .01) and serum potassium fell to a greater degree with HCTZ (0.3 mEq/L v 0.1 mEq/L) than with nifedipine GITS. No statistically significant changes in left ventricular mass, ejection fraction, glomerular filtration rate, or renal blood flow were seen after therapy with either drug. However, the time peak LV diastolic filling rate decreased with nifedipine GITS (197 to 164 msec) and increased with HCTZ (172 to 198 msec). This treatment difference approached statistical significance (P = .07). Adverse side effects of treatment were reported by 50% of nifedipine GITS patients and 28% of patients treated with HCTZ. This treatment difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that both nifedipine GITS and HCTZ monotherapy provide significant blood pressure reduction in older hypertensives with Stage I-III diastolic hypertension. Both drugs are well tolerated with no significant adverse effect on renal or cardiovascular function after short term therapy.",5,E
8785466,ACE inhibitors in elderly patients with hypertension. Special considerations.,Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Aged; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Diuretics; Humans; Hypertension,"Ravid, M; Ravid, D","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have emerged as the class of antihypertensive and vasodilatatory agents of first choice in the treatment of elderly patients with hypertension. Normotensive patients with congestive heart failure, post-anterior myocardial infarction, or diabetes mellitus with evidence of microangiopathy will also benefit from continuous ACE inhibition. The long term use of ACE inhibitors is associated with improved survival and reduced cardiovascular, cerebral and renal morbidity in these patients. In elderly atherosclerotic patients, these agents provide good control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and peripheral resistance, with remarkable preservation of vital organ perfusion and infrequent adverse effects. Used as monotherapy, the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors is limited. However, there are advantages for using them in combination with other drugs, notably thiazide diuretics, nitrates and calcium antagonists. Renal function is thus preserved and left heart hypertrophy is prevented. There are no major differences between the various ACE inhibitors, and the choice of drug is largely a matter of personal preference.",5,E

Aciclovir was approved for the treatment of HSV infections over 10 years ago, and it remains an important and reliable antiviral agent. Recent approvals in some countries of valaciclovir for VZV infection and famciclovir for both HSV and VZV infections demonstrate the rapidity of change in this field. Intravenous ganciclovir and foscarnet are approved for the treatment of CMV infection in the immunocompromised patient. Five of the antiherpetic drugs under current clinical development are nucleoside analogues or their prodrugs; another is a phosphorylated nucleoside (nucleotide). Four of the nucleoside agents-penciclovir, famciclovir, valaciclovir and lobucavir-are being developed for the management of HSV and VZV infections. Valaciclovir is also being developed for the prevention of CMV infections and famciclovir and lobucavir for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infection. Oral ganciclovir, lobucavir, ISIS 2922 and cidofovir are being developed for the suppression of CMV infections in immunocompromised patients. Sorivudine has been studied in VZV infections. n-Docosanol is under development for HSV infections, and cidofovir is being developed for both HSV and CMV infections, as well as for treatment of other viral diseases. Traditionally, the adverse effects associated with anti-CMV compounds have been more difficult to manage and are acceptable clinically only because of the severity of the underlying infection and lack of safer therapeutic alternatives. In general, toxicity issues continue to be problematic in the anti-CMV arena, although newer agents have improved the situation to some extent. In contrast, the safety of anti-HSV compounds has traditionally been excellent, establishing a safety standard that must be met by newer agents entering the field.",8,8

The randomization was stratified on the basis of whether patients had ischemic or nonischemic causes of heart failure. The primary end point of the study was death from any cause and hospitalization for major cardiovascular events.; Primary end points were reached in 42 percent of the placebo group and 39 percent of the amlodipine group, representing a 9 percent reduction in the combined risk of fatal and nonfatal events with amlodipine (95 percent confidence interval, 24 percent reduction to 10 percent increase; P=0.31).

Though a prophylactic treatment both with beta-adrenergic blocking agents and the calcium antagonist diltiazem has been used for the prevention of post-operative SVT, no study yet has performed a prospective comparison of the efficacy of these therapies.; To investigate the prophylactic effect of either a calcium antagonist (diltiazem, 0.1 mg/kg per h i.v.) or a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol, 10 mg every 6 h postoperatively), we randomized prospectively 103 consecutive patients into three groups, the third one serving as a control group. Anti-arrhythmic medication was started with the procedure and was continued until the 3rd postoperative day.; Preoperative conditions were the same for the three groups concerning age, extent of coronary heart disease, ventricular function and heart-related medication. There were no differences in intraoperative parameters or postoperative enzyme patterns. Diltiazem was ineffective in preventing SVT, the incidence being exactly the same as in the control group (35%). Propranolol reduced the occurrence of SVT significantly (7%, P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients treated with diltiazem needed positive inotropic support more often in the first hours after surgery than patients of the control group (30% vs 5%, P < 0.01).; The perioperative administration of low-dose propranolol is considered a safe and effective drug prophylaxis to avoid the occurrence of SVT after bypass surgery.",6,E

These have included retrospective case control studies in hypertension and meta-analyses of small scale studies in unstable angina and myocardial infarction (MI). Most of the reports were primarily concerned with the use of the short acting dihydropyridine nifedipine. Despite wide media coverage of these reports, the results are by no means irrefutable and, because of the nature of the studies themselves, are open to several criticisms. Calcium channel blockers are currently being evaluated in large-scale, prospective, randomised controlled studies, but results are unlikely to be available within the next few years. Meanwhile, the consensus view seems to be that short acting dihydropyridines should in general be avoided and have no place in the management of unstable angina and post MI. In the setting of stable angina, long acting dihydropyridines should generally be used in conjunction with a beta-blocker. In hypertensive patients, long acting dihydropyridines may be used as alternative antihypertensive agents in patients in whom the first line agents (diuretics and beta-blockers) are poorly tolerated, contra-indicated or ineffective.",5,E

The aim of the study was to assess effects of sublingual 10 mg nifedipine (n = 15) or 25 mg captopril (n = 13) on HRV in consecutive patients admitted to hospital due to severe hypertension. HRV was calculated on-line from 300 cardiac cycles before and 60-90 min after drug administration. At baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) was > 190 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 110 mm Hg. Both agents caused similar reduction of blood pressure (BP). Nifedipine reduced variance (-63 +/- 6%; P < 0.0001) and high-frequency (HF) component (-72 +/- 8%; P < 0.0001), and increased both LF/HF ratio (+870 +/- 336%; P < 0.02) and heart rate (+14 +/- 3%; P < 0.0001). Captopril exerted different effects: variance and HF component increased by +176 +/- 55%; (P < 0.007) and +126 +/- 44% (P < 0.015), respectively. LF/HF (low/high frequency) ratio decreased (-44 +/- 19%; P < 0.04) together with heart rate (-4 +/- 1%; < 0.009). It is concluded that captopril, in contrast to nifedipine, increases HRV and decreases LF/HF ratio and therefore is a better choice in hypertensive patients who might be prone to dangerous arrhythmias.",5,E
8818583,Calcium antagonists in the elderly. A risk-benefit analysis.,Aged; Aging; Calcium Channel Blockers; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronary Disease; Drug Interactions; Humans; Hypertension; Risk Assessment,"Schwartz, J B","Calcium antagonists are effective in lowering blood pressure, relieving anginal symptoms and improving exercise tolerance in older and younger patients with coronary artery disease. Verapamil and diltiazem are effective in slowing ventricular response rates to supraventricular arrhythmias in both older and younger patients. Although they belong to at least 3 distinct chemical classes, a moderate decrease in the clearance of all calcium antagonists occurs with aging. Most clinical trials of these drugs have used the same dosages in older and younger patients, confounding analyses of sensitivity in older compared with younger patients. Greater reductions in blood pressure usually occur in older compared with younger patients receiving the same dosages of calcium antagonists; similarly, the dosage required to reduce blood pressure to a certain level is usually lower in older compared with younger patients. Drug acquisition costs are generally higher for calcium antagonists than for beta-blockers or diuretics. Compared with younger patients, greater heart rate suppression may be seen in older patients treated with verapamil and diltiazem; conversely, heart rate increases are usually seen with dihydropyridines. Calcium antagonists have not been shown to provide long-term benefits or decreased morbidity or mortality in elderly patients with hypertension. Verapamil, but not dihydropyridines, decreases mortality after myocardial infarction in patients without congestive heart failure. Calcium antagonists have not been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of acute stroke. Adverse effects, such as a postural hypotension, may be more frequent in elderly compared with younger patients. In addition, the elderly are at greater risk for drug interactions with calcium antagonists due to the higher likelihood that they are receiving other drugs.",5,E

Patients were randomized to receive either losartan or nifedipine GITS in a double-masked, double-dummy fashion. A 4-week placebo washout period established baseline untreated blood pressure measurements and was followed by a 12-week active treatment period. Patients receiving losartan (n = 110) were initially given 50 mg once a day (QD) and could be titrated to losartan/HCTZ 50 mg/12.5 mg QD after 4 weeks followed by losartan/HCTZ 50 mg/25 mg QD after 8 weeks, as necessary. Patients in the nifedipine GITS group (n = 113) received 30 mg QD, which could titrated to 60 mg QD after 4 weeks followed by 90 mg QD after 8 weeks. Medication was titrated upward as necessary to achieve a sitting trough diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy, tolerability, and quality-of-life scores were assessed after 12 weeks of each therapy. Trough sitting diastolic blood pressure reductions after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of therapy were clinically comparable: losartan, -8.9, -11.6, and -12.7 mm Hg, respectively, and nifedipine GITS, -9.3, -11.0, and -11.1 mm Hg, respectively, with the mean reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure at 12 weeks in the losartan group 1.6 mm Hg lower (95% confidence interval, 3.4 mm Hg lower to 0.3 mm Hg Higher) than the mean reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure in the nifedipine GITS group. Similarly, reductions in systolic blood pressure between the two treatment groups were comparable at all time points. The percentage of patients reaching the goal trough sitting diastolic blood pressure was comparable for the two treatment groups, with 74% of patients in the losartan regimen and 68% of patients in the nifedipine GITS regimen reaching the goal. Of patients reporting adverse events in the two groups (75 patients receiving losartan and 69 receiving nifedipine GITS), there was significantly more edema in the nifedipine GITS group (15% vs 4%; P = 0.005). Fourteen (12%) patients in the nifedipine GITS group were withdrawn due to an adverse event (eight of these were for edema). Six patients (5%) in the losartan group were withdrawn due to an adverse event (none of these patients had edema). There were significant differences in the patient-reported quality-of-life symptom bother inventory with respect to edema, with nifedipine GITS therapy causing significantly more bother due to edema in patients, regardless of whether that symptom was present at baseline (27% vs 9%; P = 0.0004). No statistically significant differences for bother due to the other symptoms in the inventory were noted. Of note, while the incidence of patient-reported symptom bother due to edema in the nifedipine GITS group was 27%, the incidence of physician-reported drug-related edema was 12%. This difference points to the need for improved physician-patient communication regarding adverse effects and their impact of patients' quality of life. In conclusion, a regimen of losartan, when compared with a regimen of nifedipine GITS, provides comparable efficacy, and with respect to edema, superior tolerability, less bother to patients, and fewer therapy dropouts.",I,6

Twenty outpatients with mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris and positive exercise test, after a 2-week baseline placebo period, were randomized to receive long-acting metoprolol (OROS) 14/190 mg o.d., nifedipine SR 20 mg b.i.d. or their combination in a sequence of a 3 x 3 Latin square design. Two patients withdrew from the study (1 for adverse event during metoprolol and 1 for rise of BP during nifedipine). Nifedipine, metoprolol and their combination significantly reduced the weekly number of angina attacks and nitroglycerin consumption with respect to baseline. The total number of ischemic events (at 24-hour ECG monitoring) significantly decreased after each treatment with respect to baseline. Twenty-four hours mean systolic and diastolic BP were reduced by both nifedipine alone and metoprolol alone; the combination of the two drugs led to a further decrease in both systolic and diastolic BP. The duration of silent ischemic episodes was significantly reduced by nifedipine and combination but not by metoprolol. On the other hand 24 hours symptomatic attacks/patient were significantly reduced by beta-blocker and combination, but not by nifedipine. Metoprolol alone and administered with nifedipine caused a decrease, with respect to placebo baseline, in 24-hour mean heart rate (HR) and reduced the increase of HR and systolic BP at the onset of ST depression during symptomatic ischemic episodes. The effort time and time to ST = -1 mm at treadmill were significantly increased by treatment with nifedipine alone, with metoprolol alone and with their combination, but the combination was more effective than the individual therapies. ST depression at peak exercise was significantly reduced by each treatment. The slopes of correlations between the ST-segment variation and systolic BP, HR and rate-pressure product during exercise, significantly decreased after all treatments with respect to placebo baseline, more with the combination therapy than with nifedipine alone and metoprolol alone. In conclusion, based on our results the favourable interaction of metoprolol OROS and nifedipine given concomitantly, is likely to be due to a better control, respect to each individual therapy, of the pathogenetic mechanism of myocardia ischemia: BP and HR increases during exercise and during symptomatic ischemic episodes are controlled by the beta-blocker and coronary vasoconstriction during silent ischemia is prevented by the calcium-antagonist.",7,E

Further, medullasin-positive cells of zones II and III in the overgrowth group had infiltrated more extensively than those in the gingivitis group (p < 0.001), indicating the participation of this enzyme in the mechanism of NF-induced gingival overgrowth. These observations suggest that medullasin may play a part in NF-induced overgrowth both in host defence and in immunoregulation, possibly cytotoxically.",2,E

Calcium antagonists with long vs short elimination half-life may show marked differences in their antihypertensive effect during short interruptions of therapy by missed doses. 2. In the present study we evaluated the blood pressure lowering effect of amlodipine vs diltiazem both on active maintenance treatment and after active treatment was interrupted for 2 days by placebo using a double-blind randomized design. After a single blind placebo run-in period, hypertensive patients were randomized to amlodipine 5 mg once daily or diltiazem 90 mg twice daily. After 4-6 weeks, doses were increased to 10 mg once daily or 180 mg twice daily, if necessary for control of diastolic blood pressure. During week 9 or 10 on active treatment blisterpacks contained 2 days of placebo. Twenty-four hour blood pressure monitoring was performed at the end of run-in period and during week 9 and 10 on active vs interrupted therapy. 3. Active therapy by amlodipine (n = 20) lowered day systolic blood pressure by 17 +/- 2 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 12 +/- 2 mmHg and did not change heart rate. In second day of interrupted therapy most of these responses were still present. Diltiazem (n = 14) lowered day systolic blood pressure by 13 +/- 2 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure by 11 +/- 2 mmHg and heart rate by 10 +/- 2 beats min-1. Most of these responses had disappeared during the second day of interrupted therapy. 4. We conclude that amlodipine and diltiazem are fairly similar in lowering blood pressure from an efficacy point of view. However, during short periods of noncompliance blood pressure control will persist markedly better with the agent with a long vs the one with a short elimination half-life.",5,E

In order to find out, a longitudinal study was carried out, over a year, comparing a group of patients who were given nifedipine (NG, n = 18) and another group who were given diltiazem (DG, n = 13) with 2 others: one comprised cardiopathic patients who took no calcium antagonists (CG, n = 12) and the other contained patients who were medically healthy, with moderate periodontitis (HG, n = 12). On their basal visit, they were examined and instructed in oral hygiene, and then given causal periodontal treatment, being seen again at 4 and 8 months, when hygiene instructions were reinforced. They were seen for the last time at 12 months, when they were again examined. Groups NG and DG, on their basal visit, showed larger gum size than groups HG and CG, which was statistically significant; on their final visit, these differences remained only at the interproximal level. The number of patients with gingival overgrowth-taking the average of group HG as a minimal value-was much higher in groups CG (92%), DG (100%) and NG (89%) on the basal visit; on the final visit, the differences remained only in groups DG (85%) and NG (83%). The probing pocket depth reduction was much greater in groups HG and CG than in DG and NG, basically due to a greater gaining on clinical attachment level. The % of sites in which the pocket depth improved by more than 2 mm was 39.8% in HG, 54.5% in CG, 23.7% in DG and 28.7% in NG. The % of sites where the attachment gain by more than 2 mm was 46.2% in HG, 55.5% in CG, 22.8% in DG and 21.4% in NG. The amount of plaque and bleeding on probing, which was similar in all groups on the basal visit, decreased throughout the study, especially between the basal and 2nd visit in groups HG and CG. We have demonstrated that patients that take nifedipine and diltiazem show a larger gum size and their response to causal periodontal treatment is poorer than in the healthy and the cardiac groups.",I,2

The study was randomized and double-blinded with a 36-week parallel, two-branched, cross-over design after a single-blind, run-in period of 4 weeks on placebo and 6 weeks on 300 mg diltiazem OD. Each branch included six 6-week active treatment periods with 180, 240, and 300 mg tablets, one or two tablets OD. Participants were men and postmenopausal women, aged 40-70 years, with uncomplicated primary hypertension (WHO stages I and II) and a supine diastolic blood pressure of 95-115 mm Hg in the absence of antihypertensive medication. A total of 138 patients from various clinics participated in the study. All were included in the intention to treat analysis, and 117 patients were included in the per protocol analysis. Criteria for evaluation were blood pressure, heart rate, and response rate, as well as plasma diltiazem and metabolite M1 concentration before morning dose. Well-being of the patients and adverse events were recorded. Electrocardiogram and standard laboratory tests were obtained. Analysis of variance was used for statistical calculations. Supine blood pressures and response rates in the per protocol analysis were 161.2/97.0 for placebo (29.1%), 155.2/ 92.8 for 240 mg (54.7%), 153.8/91.6 for 300 mg (55.6%), 155.5/92.0 for 360 mg (59.0%), and 152.0/90.5 for 420 mg (63.2%) of diltiazem OD. The intention to treat analysis was very similar to the per protocol analysis. There was a small but statistically significant decrease in heart rate for all doses of diltiazem OD compared to placebo. A linear relationship existed between the dose and the plasma concentration of both diltiazem and metabolite M1, as well as a dose-response relationship. Diltiazem OD in the dose range 240-420 mg was generally well tolerated and not differently perceived from the placebo treatment except for ankle edema (2-6%). The study shows that OD diltiazem is significantly superior to placebo for mild to moderate hypertension and that the effect is large enough to be clinically valuable. It also shows that there is a linear dose-response relationship for diltiazem between 240 and 420 mg.",5,E

In the majority of patients presenting with bezoars there is a clear predisposing factor. This article highlights those drugs or groups of drugs which have been implicated in bezoar formation. Although bezoars are rare, it is important that the clinician is aware of the possibility of their development, particularly in susceptible individuals. This is because bezoars often develop in the elderly and in those with serious coexistent disease. They may be difficult to diagnose and recourse to laparotomy is frequently required to treat them. As a result, they are associated with a significant morbidity and mortality.",5,E

Newer calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine group have longer elimination half-lives (t1/2) that permit once-daily dosage and are generally better tolerated than their parent compound. In this study, the efficacy and safety of lacidipine and amlodipine were compared in 65 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension attending the hypertension outpatient clinic of a teaching hospital in a randomized double-blind cross-over trial with dose titration. Lacidipine and amlodipine both significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP: by 19.2 +/- 13.5 and 22.3 +/- 15.3 mm Hg, respectively) and diastolic BP (DBP: 13.3 +/- 4.2 and 12.3 +/- 5.3 mm Hg, respectively) 24 h postdose. There were no significant differences in their antihypertensive effects. The incidence of adverse events (AE) was 3% for lacidipine and 8% for amlodipine. The incidence of withdrawal from the study due to side effects was 0% for lacidipine and 3% for amlodipine. These results suggest that lacidipine is well-tolerated, and is as effective as amlodipine as a once-daily antihypertensive agent.",5,E

This randomized double-blind study consisted of two crossover phases in each of which once and twice daily treatment were compared. In the first treatment phase the total daily dose of nisoldipine was 10 mg, which increased to 20 mg during the second phase. Trough blood pressure measurements were made 12/24 h postdose. During the first phase the blood pressure values following treatment with nisoldipine 5 mg twice daily were significantly lower than with 10 mg once daily. However, when the daily dose was increased to 20 mg there was no significant difference between the two treatment regimens. There was also no significant difference between nisoldipine 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily but the results for 20 mg once daily were significantly lower than for 10 mg once daily. Four patients withdrew from the study because of adverse events, one while on placebo and three while on nisoldipine therapy. Between 33 percent and 47 percent of patients reported adverse events during nisoldipine treatment but the majority of adverse events reported were mild and did not require treatment withdrawal. Nisoldipine twice daily appeared to be more effective and better tolerated than once daily treatment for 24-h blood pressure control.",5,E

The efficacy of verapamil relative to placebo in patients with stable angina pectoris is confirmed, and the drug is at least as effective as nifedipine, propranolol or metoprolol and of similar efficacy to bepridil and nicardipine when administered as a conventional or sustained release formulation. Verapamil is the first calcium antagonist to be shown in a double-blind study to significantly reduce mortality and reinfarction rate after acute myocardial infarction in patients without heart failure. In these patients, the reduction in mortality achieved with verapamil was similar to that reported with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, suggesting that verapamil may be a suitable alternative to beta-blockers as secondary prevention in patients intolerant of these drugs. Recurrence of stenosis in patients who successfully undergo percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) limits the usefulness of the procedure. Verapamil has recently been shown to significantly reduce the rate of restenosis in patients with stable angina at risk of recurrence, although these initial results require confirmation. Verapamil, therefore, is effective in the treatment of patients with stable angina pectoris, appears to be an alternative to beta-blockers in selected patients as late start secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction and has a potential role in preventing recurrent stenosis after PTCA, if initial results are confirmed.",5,E

QOL assessments in the hypertensives and in 155 normotensives included a self-structured scale to measure the subjective perception of QOL, the severity, desirability and controllability of recent critical life events, semantic memory, physical dysfunction, sleep disorders, sexual difficulties, depression and work-related stress. The overall withdrawal rate during the trial was 19%, mainly due to lack of efficacy and adverse experiences. At baseline, and at the end of the trial, the normotensives as compared to hypertensive patients, had significantly better scores in most QOL measures. Patients treated with the combination of isradipine and captopril reported more favorable changes in the subjective measure of QOL (P < 0.03) and in semantic memory (P < 0.001) than patients treated with any of the monotherapies or with methyldopa in combination with captopril. There were no statistically significant differences among treatments for changes of other indices of QOL. In most QOL measurements, normotensives rated better then hypertensives.

However, for calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil) there was either no benefit, or positive effects have been reported in subgroups only. Recent studies have raised concern about the safety of this drug class, especially in patients with coronary heart disease. We studied the long-term survival, for a median follow-up time of 4.4 years, of 1197 non-diabetic patients in the population-based AMI registry in Augsburg, Germany, aged 25-74 years, who had survived a first Q wave acute myocardial infarction for at least 28 days. The impact of thrombolysis and prescribed medication at discharge (beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and calcium channel blockers) on long-term survival was analysed using the Cox-Proportional-Hazard model, controlling for age, sex, and concomitant cardiac drug use. Thrombolysis (risk ratio, RR, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.48-1.08), long-term beta-blockade (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.36-0.74) and antiplatelet drug use (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.94) were associated with considerable reductions in total mortality. The use of calcium channel blockers was not associated with a reduction in total mortality (RR 1.23; 95% CI 0.89-1.69). Separate analyses for nifedipine (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.68-1.48), and diltiazem (RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.04-2.32) showed an increased risk of death associated with the latter. Using patients on beta-blockers only (RR 1.00) as a reference, the prescription of these calcium channel blockers was consistently associated with an increased total mortality (nifedipine, without beta-blockers RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.12-3.57, diltiazem, without beta-blockers RR 2.87; 95% CI 1.75-4.70). These results from an observational study demonstrate a benefit of thrombolysis, beta-adrenergic blockade and antiplatelet drug use on long-term survival in acute myocardial infarction patients. Calcium channel blocker use appears to be associated with an increased risk of death. These data support the need for controlled trials to address this issue specifically.",I,6

To rigorously assess the effectiveness and safety of daily low-dose UV-A1 irradiation as a therapeutic agent in this disorder we enrolled 26 women with SLE in an 18-week two-phase study. During the initial six-week prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, the patients were divided into two groups; Group A was exposed to 60kJ/m2 of UV-A1 (340-400 nm) irradiation within a sunbed five days a week for three weeks and Group B was exposed for an equal amount of time to visible light of greater than > 430 nm (placebo). Each group was then crossed over for exposure to the other source for three weeks. During the second phase-2 weeks-patients and physicians were unblinded and patients were irradiated with progressively decreasing levels of UV-A1 only. Twenty-five patients completed the six-week placebo-controlled phase of the study and eighteen patients participated for the entire 18 weeks. In Group A the systemic lupus activity measure (SLAM) score improved significantly after three weeks of five-day-a-week UV-A1 irradiation (P < 0.05), regressing to baseline during the three weeks of placebo irradiation. Improvement recurred and progressed with six weeks of three-day-a-week UV-A1 irradiation (P < 0.05). Group B patients responded negligibly to the three weeks of visible light, more sharply to UV-A1, and as with Group A, maximally to the six weeks of three-day-a-week UV-A1 (P < 0.01). With twice- and then once-weekly UV-A1 irradiation the SLAM scores worsened slightly. All patients decreased their drug use. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA) decreased significantly (P < 0.05) and anti-nuclear antibodies non-significantly. Side effects were negligible. Visible light had no significant effect. In conclusion, low-dose UV-A1 irradiation effectively, comfortably, and without apparent toxicity diminished signs and symptoms of disease activity in SLE.",4,E

Moexipril or verapamil SR, in combination with low dose hydrochlorothiazide, resulted in decreased blood pressure in the sitting and standing positions. No correlation between blood pressure response and baseline plasma renin activity was demonstrated. The results of this study indicate that both moexipril and verapamil SR produced an additive hypertensive effect when added to low-dose hydrochlorothiazide.

The trial included patients whose sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) measurements were between 95 and 114 mm Hg, inclusive, at placebo baseline. Patients were randomized to receive either losartan or amlodipine in a double-masked, double-dummy fashion. A 4-week placebo washout period was followed by a 12-week active treatment period. Patients in the losartan arm (n = 97) were initially given 50 mg of oral (PO) losartan once a day (QD); the medication could be titrated to 50-mg losartan/ 12.5-mg HCTZ PO QD after 4 weeks, followed by 50-mg losartan plus 25-mg HCTZ PO QD after 8 weeks as necessary. Patients in the amlodipine group (n = 93) received 5-mg amlodipine PO QD, which could be titrated to 10 mg PO QD after 4 weeks, followed by 10 mg plus 25-mg HCTZ PO QD after 8 weeks.

Similar reductions in systolic blood pressure were also seen for both treatment groups. The percentage of patients reaching goal SiDBP (defined as trough SiDBP < 90 mm Hg or SiDBP > or = 90 mm Hg with a > or = 10 mm Hg drop from placebo baseline) was comparable for the two groups, with 68% of patients in the losartan group and 71% of patients in the amlodipine group reaching goal. Significantly more patients in the amlodipine group had drug-related adverse experiences (27% vs 13%). In particular, drug-related edema was more common in patients receiving the amlodipine regimen than in those receiving the losartan regimen (11% vs 1%). Patients in the amlodipine arm reported significantly more bother due to edema, regardless of whether edema was present at baseline, than did patients in the losartan arm (12% vs 2%), although overall quality of life was not different in the two treatment groups.

Felodipine at 4 h significantly increased exercise duration assessed after 4 weeks of treatment (increase 34 +/- 65 s vs 18 +/- 71 s in placebo-treated patients; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.11; P = 0.01), and after 12 weeks of treatment (increase 39 +/- 103 s vs 3 +/- 72 s; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.16; P = 0.02). The time until onset of exercise-induced anginal pain and time until 1 mm ST depression assessed after 4 weeks of treatment also increased significantly with felodipine compared to placebo. No statistically significant changes in exercise test parameters evaluated 24 h after medication were observed. The addition of felodipine once daily demonstrated a sustained improvement in exercise duration in patients symptomatic despite treatment with a beta-blocker evaluated 4 h after drug intake. At 24 h post dose, no statistically significant effect was observed. Felodipine is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects and no adverse effect on quality of life.",I,I

Impotence or ejaculatory failure was reported in 2.1% of the patients, decreased libido in 1% and gynaecomastia and related conditions in 0.4%. Impotence was the most frequent reason for stopping treatment with finasteride and was the most commonly reported adverse reaction to the drug. Of the patients included in the elderly cohort involved in this study, 819 (5.5%) died; none of these deaths was attributed to finasteride.; Impotence or ejaculatory failure, decreased libido and gynaecomastia in a small proportion of patients were associated with the use of finasteride.

The reported adverse effect profile for each of these drugs varies, but tends to hold true to drug class and are typified by the adverse reactions reported for nifedipine and amlodipine (dihydropyridines), diltiazem (benzothiazepines) and verapamil (phenylalkylamines). Minor adverse effects such as flushing, headache, ankle oedema, palpitations and constipation are not uncommon and frequently require the cessation of treatment. Of greater concern affecting the wide and common first-line use of calcium antagonists is the as-yet unresolved issue of a reportedly greater risk of myocardial infarction and death following the use of short-acting nifedipine in patients with a history of hypertension, myocardial infarction or angina. Until this issue is fully resolved, it would seem prudent to limit the use of this agent in 'at-risk' patients and to await the results of further prospective studies before a final conclusion can be made.",5,E

Physiologic rational for the chronobiology of cardiac disease exists and can provide a basis on which to examine the efficacy of agents to manage cardiac disease. The use of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) devices have advanced our ability to describe the interplay of chronobiologic rhythms and pharmacodynamic response to antihypertensive medications. This review summarizes the studies evaluating the use of various antihypertensive medications in the context of using 24-hour blood pressure monitoring devices. The studies are described in an attempt to increase awareness of chronobiology and potential implications of designing chronotherapeutic regimens.,3,E

Clinical events and risk modification were analysed in collaboration with the University of Montreal. Seventy-four patients with severe hypertension were reallocated to active nifedipine treatment after placebo run-in.; Cox's proportional hazards model accounting for covariates demonstrated a highly significant decrease in the probability of events: 'original treatment assignment' analysis indicated that 77 events occurred in the placebo and 32 in the nifedipine group. Similar significances were achieved with 'actual treatment' or 'changes excluded' (excluding reallocated subjects) analyses. A significant reduction in relative risk was observed for strokes and severe arrhythmia with an overall decrease from 1.0 to 0.41 (95% confidence interval 0.27-0.61).; Nifedipine treatment diminished the number of severe clinical outcomes in elderly hypertensives significantly.,5,E

The number of doses of all drugs prescribed ranged from 121 to 18,874 on from 4 to 357 prescriptions per patient over 1 to 19 months. The mean number of doses of analgesic drugs prescribed before sumatriptan therapy was 56 per month and after initiation of sumatriptan was 46 per month. The prescribing of multiple analgesics was common; 79% received three or more different analgesics. Twenty-two (63%) patients were prescribed medications indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine concomitantly with drugs indicated for symptomatic treatment. Twenty-four (69%) patients were prescribed medication capable of inducing migraine. We conclude that sumatriptan did not have a major impact on the outcomes of these patients judged by their use of analgesics. The simplest explanation is that many of the patients were suffering from analgesic-induced headache rather than migraine. In addition, we conclude that there were deficiencies in prescribing practices including numbers, quantities, and choice of analgesics; the use of analgesics concomitantly with drugs indicated for migraine prophylaxis; and the use of drugs capable of inducing migraine.

The 18 patients, (10 in New York Heart Association functional class III and 8 in class IV) were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Bisoprolol was administered as the first drug in 10 patients and diltiazem was administered in 8. Cross-over to bisoprolol was also performed in 3 patients. At the end of the study, among the 13 patients who had been given bisoprolol, 9 showed a good response (efficacy rate: 69%). In contrast, only 3 of the 8 patients who received diltiazem showed a good response (efficacy rate: 37.5%). Among the patients in NYHA class III, all 7 (100%) who were treated with bisoprolol responded but only 2 of the 4 (50%) treated with diltiazem responded (p < 0.05). Among the patients in class IV, 2 of 6 (33%) responded to bisoprolol and 1 of 4 (25%) responded to diltiazem (not significant). These results suggest that diltiazem, like bisoprolol, has a beneficial effect in patients with DCM, with a greater effect in class III patients. However, we conclude that diltiazem should usually be used as a second choice to improve heart failure in DCM, and as the first medication only in those with contraindications to beta-blocking agents.",I,I

The side effects reported by the physicians are more numerous at the treatment start than at longeur terme. That is due to the therapeutic modifications of the physicians or to a better acceptation of the drugs by the patients or to a real disappearance of the side effects. Reported side effects are more frequent in Southern Europe, France than Northern Europe and more frequent among women that men. The incidence of side effects is proportional to the number of prescribed drugs. Time and the number of antihypertensive drugs appear as the most important factors.",7,E

The primary outcome measure is glomerular filtration rate as assessed by 24-h creatinine clearance. Secondary outcome measures are urinary albumin excretion, left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality will also be evaluated. Given the data showing the impact of hypertension on complications in NIDDM, the ABCD Trial is designed to determine if intensive antihypertensive therapy will be more efficacious than moderate antihypertensive therapy on the outcome of diabetic complications in NIDDM.",I,I

The characteristics of the life quality in combination with the results of exercise test are considered of great importance for selecting medical treatment in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. However, little information is available on how this first evaluation may be used to select the best pharmacological approach in individual patients. In this prospective multicentre study, 144 patients with stable angina were enrolled in 6 centres. Due to protocol violations and drop-outs 116 patients were evaluated for tolerability; 101 patients were evaluated for efficacy. After baseline evaluation, consisting of an exercise test and a questioning investigating patients' anginal symptoms and several psychometric testings, the patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment for 12 weeks with either trapidil, 200 mg t.i.d. or nifedipine, 10 mg t.i.d. according to a parallel group design. After 6 and 12 weeks exercise tests and psychometric testings were repeated. Both trapidil and nifedipine prolonged exercise tolerance (trapidil 39.2% vs. nifedipine 33.3%) or increased the total exercise over baseline levels (trapidil 57.8% vs. nifedipine 61.2%). Using Mann-Whitney U-test the SB-S-rating scale and the physician's assessment revealed a comparable improvement of life quality (trapidil 69.4% vs. nifedipine 80.0%) under both treatments. In addition patient questioning showed a significant reduction in angina attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption. None of the characteristics of anginal symptoms or exercise test gave evidence for a significant difference between nifedipine and trapidil. Both drugs demonstrated similar safety profiles (adverse events (AEs) 12.7% for trapidil and 11.1% for nifedipine); four patients of the trapidil group and one of the nifedipine group discontinued the clinical trial because of AEs. The results of a baseline exercise test and rating questionnaires may offer useful information for selecting medical treatment in stable angina pectoris.",7,E

In this study, a controlled-onset extended-release system (COER-24) that delivers verapamil in a manner designed to achieve maximal levels of drug during the early morning surge in BP was compared with placebo. Ninety-five patients with mild to moderate hypertension were studied. Of this group, 49 patients (mean age 57.6 +/- 1.4 years; 35 men and 14 women) were randomized to take verapamil COER-24 240 mg at 10 PM, and 46 subjects (mean age 55.8 +/- 1.5 years; 29 men and 17 women) were randomized to take placebo. Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed after a 4-week initial placebo period and was repeated after 4 weeks of treatment with verapamil or placebo. Verapamil COER-24 resulted in significant (p < 0.001) decreases in mean whole-day systolic and diastolic BP (-8.2/-6.3 mm Hg; baseline 152/93.0 mm Hg) when compared with placebo (+0.3/-0.9 mm Hg; baseline 150.3/93.2 mm Hg). From 6 AM to noon, verapamil COER-24 resulted in a change in systolic and diastolic BP of -11.6/-9.0 mm Hg, which was significantly (p < 0.001) greater than the change that occurred with placebo (-0.5/-1.0 mm Hg) during the same period. In the last 4 hours of the dosing interval (6 PM to 10 PM), verapamil COER-24 caused significantly greater (p < 0.001) decreases in BP (-7.4/-4.8 mm Hg) than did placebo (+2.7/+1.0 mm Hg). These data demonstrate that the COER-24 system, when administered in the late evening, achieves maximal BP reduction during the early morning hours. Moreover, BP reductions were sustained throughout the 24-hour period.",5,E

A total of 174 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension from 15 hospitals in Germany and Poland was included in the study. Eighty-seven were treated with the alpha-receptor blocker bunazosin and the same number with the beta-blocker atenolol. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups, whereas only atenolol decreased pulse rate. In the bunazosin group HDL-cholesterol was significantly increased after 6 months of treatment, whereas all other analysed parameters remained unchanged. In the atenolol group total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total triglycerides, apolipoprotein E, VLDL-cholesterol and VLDL-triglycerides were significantly increased after 6 months of therapy. There was a significant difference between bunazosin and atenolol for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL-triglycerides and apolipoprotein B levels. As a consequence, there was a significant difference in the atherogenic index of both groups. We conclude that bunazosin is favorable in the treatment of high blood pressure, because the coronary risk is not negatively influenced as shown for atenolol.",6,E

Our objective was to determine the prevalence and degree of hyperprolactinaemia associated with verapamil in the clinical setting.; Observation with cross-sectional and longitudinal components in the setting of an urban teaching hospital and its satellite out-patient clinics.; Male out-patients excluding those taking other drugs known to raise PRL, renal failure and known primary hypothyroidism (1265 eligible subjects). Control subjects were drawn from eligible out-patients not taking verapamil.; Serum PRL levels, frequency of persistent hyperprolactinaemia and total testosterone levels.; Prolactin levels were obtained in 449 subjects on verapamil (35.5% response rate) and 166 controls. The proportions of individuals with hyperprolactinaemia (PRL > 460 mU/l) were 0.085 and 0.030 in the verapamil and control groups, respectively (P = 0.012, X2-test). The mean (+/- SD) serum PRL levels were 267 +/- 205 and 203 +/- 118 mU/l in the verapamil and control groups, respectively (P < 0.001, independent t-test). Of the 38 patients with previously determined elevated PRL levels, follow-up data were obtained in 25 (65.8%); one was found to have a pituitary adenoma and was excluded from the analysis. Fifteen of the 24 were still on verapamil (Group 1) and 14 (93.3%) continued to be hyperprolactinaemic. In 9 patients verapamil had been discontinued (Group 2) and all had normal PRL levels. Continued verapamil use was associated with persistent hyperprolactinaemia (odds ratio > 120, P < 0.00001). The mean +/- SD serum testosterone levels at follow-up were significantly lower in Group 1 (6.16 +/- 2.52 nmol/l) than in Group 2 (9.42 +/- 3.92 nmol/l, P = 0.029, independent t-test).; The prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia associated with verapamil use in this study of male out-patients was 8.5% (95% CI 5.9-11.1%). The persistence of hyperprolactinaemia when verapamil was continued (Group 1) and the return to normal PRL levels when verapamil was discontinued (Group 2) confirm verapamil's causal role in the development of hyperprolactinaemia. While low testosterone levels were common in both groups, testosterone levels were lower in patients on verapamil. Our data suggest that screening for hyperprolactinaemia should be considered in male patients taking verapamil.",I,2

Exclusion criteria included ventricular response rate lower than 100 or higher than 200 beats/minute, allergy to study drugs, hypotension with evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion, and conduction abnormalities. Consenting patients were randomly assigned to receive rapid digitalization (1.0 mg over 2 hours) or i.v. verapamil (sequential 5-mg boluses up to 20 mg). After ventricular rate was controlled (< 100 beats/minute), oral quinidine (200 mg) was initiated and repeated every 2 hours until conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) occurred, until 1 g of quinidine was administered, or until adverse effects supervened. Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, time to conversion, and adverse effects were documented.; Forty-four patients received the study drugs. Three were withdrawn, leaving 19 in the verapamil-quinidine (VER-Q) group and 22 in the digoxin-quinidine (DIG-Q) group. Sixteen patients (84%) in the VER-Q group and 10 (45%) in the DIG-Q group converted to NSR within 6 hours (P < .02). Mean time to conversion (+/-SD) was 185 +/- 146 minutes for VER-Q and 368 +/- 386 minutes for DIG-Q patients (P = NS). Twelve VER-Q patients (63%) and 6 DIG-Q patients (27%) were discharged from the ED (P < .05). Minor adverse effects were more common in the VER-Q group. No mortality or significant morbidity occurred.; The sequential combination of verapamil and quinidine, in the doses studied, is an effective treatment for PAF and is superior to digoxin-quinidine.

However, these recommendations were based solely on blood pressure (BP) measured in the clinic. The objective of the present 32-week double-blind study was to compare the effects of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and amlodipine (AML) in elderly patients with confirmed ambulatory hypertension. After a 4-week placebo washout period, 42 (25 men, 17 women) patients (mean age, 69 years) with clinic sitting diastolic BP of 95 to 114 mm Hg and daytime ambulatory diastolic BP of > or = 90 mm Hg were randomized double-blind to receive AML 5 to 10 mg (n = 21) or HCTZ 12.5 to 25 mg (n = 21) once daily. After 8 weeks of monotherapy, patients in whom clinic diastolic BP remained > or = 90 mm Hg were given combination therapy with the other agent. Amlodipine monotherapy induced significant reductions in clinic, mean 24-h, daytime and sleep systolic/diastolic BPs whereas only clinic BP decreased significantly in patients treated with HCTZ monotherapy. Moreover, 19/21 versus 8/21 patients on AML and HCTZ monotherapies achieved adequate BP control. At the end of the 32-week treatment period, combination therapy in the HCTZ group resulted in statistically significant reductions in clinic as well as in 24-h, daytime and sleep ambulatory BPs that were similar to those observed in the AML monotherapy group. In conclusion, the administration of AML monotherapy induced significant reductions in both clinic and ambulatory BPs in elderly patients whereas only clinic BP was significantly decreased by HCTZ monotherapy. Moreover, the addition of AML to HCTZ in patients inadequately controlled by monotherapy has permitted statistically significant decrements in clinic as well as in ambulatory BP. Consequently, the results of the present study suggest that the use of HCTZ in doses of up to 25 mg daily is inadequate for ambulatory BP control in the elderly despite official recommendations.",5,E

In hypertension these insulin-related inhibitory effects are blunted. The aim of this study was to determine whether platelet sensitivity to insulin is affected after 12 weeks of antihypertensive treatment with calcium channel blockers. Eleven patients with essential hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes were treated with either isradipine or diltiazem. Platelet free calcium concentration was measured spectrofluorometrically in nonstimulated and in angiotensin II (1 nmol/L)-stimulated platelets that had been pre-exposed to insulin (70 microU/mL). Platelets were studied before therapy and after 12 weeks of treatment. Systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure decreased significantly during treatment. Both calcium channel blockers equally decreased fasting serum insulin levels (from 138 +/- 2.7 pmol/L before therapy to 106 +/- 9.9 pmol/L after therapy). Results with both calcium channel antagonists were similar and have been pooled. In the pretreatment phase, insulin pre-incubation had no effect on angiotensin II-stimulated intracellular free calcium and responses to angiotensin II were similar in the absence (265 +/- 10.5 nmol/L) and presence of insulin (233 +/- 12.1 nmol/L). After treatment with calcium channel blockers, insulin significantly (P < .001) reduced angiotensin II-induced rise of intracellular free calcium from 214 +/- 7.7 nmol/L (absence of insulin) to 153 +/- 9.3 nmol/L (presence of insulin). Whether these effects are due specifically to calcium channel blockers or whether they are the result of lowering of blood pressure remains unclear. Serum insulin levels were positively correlated with angiotensin II-stimulated increase in intracellular free calcium in platelets pre-exposed to insulin, (r = 0.46; P < .05) suggesting that with increasing levels of insulin resistance, the inhibitory effects of insulin are reduced. This study shows that treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetic hypertensive patients with these calcium channel blockers reduces hyperinsulinemia and increases sensitivity of platelets to the inhibitory effect of insulin on angiotensin II-stimulated calcium responses.",5,E

After a placebo run-in period, 308 patients (all white) were randomized to treatment groups and took medication once daily for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment in the 23- to 26-hour period after dosing. Patients wore a noninvasive blood pressure monitor for 24 hours before randomization and before the final visit. Investigators recorded adverse experiences at randomization and at study weeks 4 and 8, and obtained specimens for laboratory testing at randomization and at study week 8. Three hundred seven patients were evaluated for efficacy, and 308 for tolerability and safety. At end point (the last postrandomization measurement for each patient), the reduction in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure with the amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg treatment was statistically significantly greater than with any comparative therapy. The results of 24-hour monitoring showed that the amlodipine/benazepril treatment, unlike monotherapy, maintained the hourly mean diastolic blood pressure at < or = 90 mm Hg. A responder rate of 87.0% was observed with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg versus 67.5%, 53.3%, and 15.8% with amlodipine, benazepril, and placebo, respectively. This difference between the amlodipine/benazepril treatment group and each comparative single-agent treatment group was statistically significant.

Edema occurred less often in the amlodipine/benazepril group than in the amlodipine group. Overall, once-daily therapy with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg provided an antihypertensive effect that was statistically and clinically superior to amlodipine 5 mg alone, benazepril 20 mg alone, and placebo, was well tolerated, and was associated with less edema than the amlodipine treatment.",5,E

Participants with urinary sodium levels < 120 mmol/24 h (n = 99) were randomized to placebo or sodium chloride (100 mmol/24 h) for 4 weeks, and then crossed over to the alternative treatment for an additional 4 weeks. Mean baseline systolic blood pressure was 151.9 +/- 16.7 mm Hg (mean +/- SD).

Urinary sodium excretion values for open-label isradipine ad libitum versus restricted were 140.6 +/- 61.9 versus 76.9 +/- 32.4 mmol/24 h; for double-blind restricted versus supplemented, sodium excretion was 120.5 +/- 68.9 v 175.9 +/- 68.7 mmol/24 h (P < or = .0001). Changes in urinary sodium excretion were not predictive of variations in blood pressure. Urinary sodium excretion during sodium restriction correlated directly with HDL-cholesterol (P < .02) and inversely with total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol (P = .02), despite decreased total and saturated fat intake (P < .01). Sodium restriction was associated with significant reductions (P < .01) in virtually all macronutrients and electrolytes, and thus had an adverse impact on overall nutrition.

After 4 weeks' treatment, nifedipine (60 mg), improved time to onset of 0.1 mV ST-segment depression from 536 s by 72 +/- 117s, time to onset of pain from 619 s by 56 +/- 120 s, and total exercise time from 685 s by 40 +/- 88 s. Atenolol 100 mg, had a comparable effect, time to onset of 0.1 mV ST-segment depression improved from 496 s by 53 +/- 129 s, time to onset of pain from 572 s by 57 +/- 118 s, and total exercise time from 653 s by 33 +/- 99 s. Between group analysis revealed no statistically significant differences for these exercise parameters. Atenolol, but not nifedipine, significantly reduced heart rate and systolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise (P < 0.001 between groups), indicating different modes of action of the drugs. With regard to safety, both drugs were generally well tolerated. There were significantly (P = 0.01) more vasodilation related side effects with nifedipine.

Blood pressure was measured at the office after 0, 4 and 8 weeks and by 24-h ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) after 0 and 4 weeks. Spontaneously reported adverse events and a subjective symptom assessment questionnaire were used for side-effect profiling.; Mean office systolic/diastolic blood pressure was clinically relevantly reduced in all treatment groups after 4 weeks by 8/7, 12/9, 11/9 and 18/11 mmHg for F2.5, F5, N20 and N40, respectively, and after 8 weeks (F2.5-5: 17/11 mmHg: F5-10: 18/14 mmHg; N20-40: 19/14 mmHg; N40-80: 25/14 mmHg) with no statistically significant differences between these groups. The lowest dose of felodipine (F2.5) was the least effective. After 4 weeks the ABPM showed consistent 24-h reductions in blood pressure (4/2; 8/5; 7/5; 10/6 mmHg, respectively) over 24 h for the felodipine ER 5 mg group only and for both nifedipine groups. No statistically significant difference between these groups was found. An office responder does not appear to be identical to an ambulatory one and vice versa. The adverse events, mostly oedema, flushing and headache, were dose-related.; Both felodipine ER and nifedipine Retard are effective ""add-on' drugs in patients with monotherapy-resistant hypertension. The blood-pressure-lowering effect is dose-dependent and tolerability is inversely related to efficacy. The results emphasize the benefits of combining two agents with low doses.",5,E

The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) provides an excellent opportunity for examination of sexual function and effects of treatment on sexual function in men and women with stage I diastolic hypertension because of the number of drug classes studied, the double-blind study design, and the long-term follow-up. TOMHS was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 902 hypertensive individuals (557 men, 345 women), aged 45 to 69 years, treated with placebo or one of five active drugs (acebutolol, amlodipine maleate, chlorthalidone, doxazosin maleate, or enalapril maleate). All participants received intensive lifestyle counseling regarding weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, alcohol reduction (for current drinkers), and increased physical activity. Sexual function was ascertained by physician interviews at baseline and annually during follow-up. At baseline, 14.4% of men and 4.9% of women reported a problems with sexual function. In men, 12.2% had problems obtaining and/or maintaining an erection; 2.0% of women reported a problem having an orgasm. Erection problems in men at baseline were positively related to age, systolic pressure, and previous antihypertensive drug use. The incidences of erection dysfunction during follow-up in men were 9.5% and 14.7% through 24 and 48 months, respectively, and were related to type of antihypertensive therapy. Participants randomized to chlorthalidone reported a significantly higher incidence of erection problems through 24 months than participants randomized to placebo (17.1% versus 8.1%, P = .025). Incidence rates through 48 months were more similar among treatment groups than at 24 months, with nonsignificant differences between the chlorthalidone and placebo groups. Incidence was lowest in the doxazosin group but was not significantly different from the placebo group. Incidence for acebutolol, amlodipine, and enalapril groups was similar to that in the placebo group. In many cases, erection dysfunction did not require withdrawal of medication. Disappearance of erection problems among men with problems at baseline was common in all groups but greatest in the doxazosin group. Incidence of reported sexual problems in women was low in all treatment groups. In conclusion, long-term incidence of erection problems in treated hypertensive men is relatively low but is higher with chlorthalidone treatment. Effects of erection dysfunction with chlorthalidone appear relatively early and are often tolerable, and new occurrences after 2 years are unlikely. The rate of reported sexual problems in hypertensive women is low and does not appear to differ by type of drug. Similar incidence rates of erection dysfunction in placebo and most active drug groups caution against routine attribution of erection problems to antihypertensive medication.",5,E

An electrode of platinum was placed on the round window and short (10 msec) tone pulses at 8 kHz were presented to the external ear. A typical deflection of the N1-wave was determined as the hearing threshold. Quinine hydrochloride 40 mg/kg and verapamil 1 mg/kg were given intravenously. Quinine induced a significant and reversible hearing loss (mean 16 dB). This hearing loss was not at all affected by verapamil given before or after quinine. Verapamil often caused acute cardiac arrest and particularly the combination verapamil followed by quinine-induced death to the animal. We conclude that verapamil and quinine had no in vivo interaction with regard to the hearing ability.",4,E

Special attention was paid to differences between male and female patients, and to the reactivity to exercise or the diurnal variation of certain parameters.; Eight hundred and nine patients (31% females) and a matched healthy control group (n = 50).; The patients had signs of disturbed fibrinolysis, with elevated plasma levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity at rest, and attenuated responses of tPA antigen and activity to exercise. Elevated levels of fibrinogen, white blood cell counts and orosomucoid were found, suggesting increased inflammatory activity, as well as a more disturbed lipid profile (higher triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol levels) than among controls. Female patients had higher HDL cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels than male patients, but higher platelet counts and signs of enhanced platelet activity (beta-thromboglobulin excretion). In addition, female patients had lower white blood cell counts, suggesting lesser inflammatory activity.; Patients with stable angina pectoris have signs of markedly disturbed fibrinolysis both at rest and in response to exercise, as well as signs of enhanced inflammatory activity and dyslipidemia. The observed sex differences suggest that male patients with stable angina pectoris may have a more lipid-related disease, whereas it may be more dependent on platelet function in females.",5,E

After a 4-week, single-blind placebo baseline period, 707 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressures (BPs) in the range of 95 to 115 mm Hg received placebo, enalapril (5 or 20 mg), felodipine ER (2.5, 5, or 10 mg), or their combinations for an 8-week double-blind treatment period. All doses of enalapril and felodipine ER had a statistically significant (p < 0.05) additive effect in reducing both systolic and diastolic BP.

Moreover, in individuals with diabetic nephropathy, antihypertensive agents that provide sustained reductions in proteinuria slow the rate of decline in renal function compared with agents without this antiproteinuric effect. To examine whether differential effects on proteinuria affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy, we conducted a randomized study that compared the effects of a heart rate-lowering calcium channel blocker, sustained-release verapamil, with those of a beta-blocker, atenolol, on the progression of diabetic renal disease. The primary end point of the study was a change in creatinine clearance slope. Thirty-four African Americans with the following inclusion criteria were randomized to one of the two groups: serum creatinine greater than 1.4 mg/dL, proteinuria greater than 1500 mg/d, longer than a 5-year history of both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and exclusion of other renal diseases. Goal blood pressure was less than 140/90 mm Hg. All subjects received loop diuretics as second line agents to help achieve the blood pressure goal. Twenty-four-hour urinary protein and sodium excretions as well as creatinine clearance were measured at 6-month intervals. Blood pressure was measured every 3 months. After a mean follow-up of 54+/-6 months, the calcium channel blocker group demonstrated both a slower rate of decline in creatinine clearance (-1.7+/-0.9 versus -3.7+/-1.4 mL/min per year per 1.73 m2, P<.01) and a greater reduction in proteinuria compared with the atenolol group. Additionally, a greater proportion of the atenolol group had a 50% or more increase in serum creatinine compared with the verapamil group (32+/-9% versus 16+/-7%, P<.05). These between-group differences could not be explained by differences in blood pressure control. These data support the concept that antihypertensive agents that persistently maintain reductions in both arterial pressure and proteinuria slow the progression of diabetic renal disease in African Americans to a greater extent than those agents without these effects.",1,E

Studies were conducted in 23 untreated mild to moderate essential hypertensives; drugs, either calcium channel blockers or not, were given for 2 weeks according to a crossover, sequence-randomized design. Skin blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry in two skin areas: (1) the dorsum of the foot, where arteriovenous anastomoses are poorly represented, and (2) the plantar surface of the great toe, where those anastomoses are predominant. Determinations were obtained both with the foot at heart level and with it placed passively 50 cm below the heart level; percent flow changes from the horizontal to the dependent position were the measure of postural vasoconstriction. Two dihydropyridine derivatives, amlodipine (10 mg UID) and nifedipine (60 mg UID), and verapamil (240 mg BID), a chemically unrelated compound, diminished to similar extents the postural fall in skin blood flow at the dorsum of the foot. Blockade of alpha1-adrenergic and AT-1 subtype angiotensin II receptors by doxazosin (4 mg UID) and losartan (50 mg UID), respectively, exerted no effect. Postural skin blood flow responses at the plantar surface of the great toe were unmodified during the pharmacological trials. Thus, calcium channel blockers of different chemical origins antagonized postural skin vasoconstriction at the dorsum of the foot. The data indicate altered postural capillary blood flow regulation, since arteriovenous anastomoses are anatomically absent at this site; the effect was independent of either alpha1-adrenoceptor or angiotensin II receptor antagonism. Interference with skin postural vasoconstrictor mechanisms may result in net filtration of fluid to the extravascular compartment. This mechanism might explain the as yet unknown pathogenesis of ankle edema during treatment with calcium antagonists.",5,E

Of the 208 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension, two were excluded from the main efficacy analysis, and the rest randomized into one of four treatment groups, to receive either placebo, or nisoldipine CC at doses of 10, 20, or 30 mg once daily for 6 weeks, following a 4-week placebo run-in period. Blood pressure measurements (supine, standing, diastolic, and systolic) were taken at trough plasma levels, 24 h after previous dosing at 2-week intervals throughout the study. Adverse events and laboratory parameters (plasma lipid and glucose levels, and thyroid function) were monitored. All three doses of nisoldipine CC lowered blood pressure, as compared with placebo, 24 h after dosing. At endpoint (after 6 weeks) mean changes in supine blood pressure from baseline were (systolic/diastolic) 0.9/-2.3, -8.0/-5.5, -16.9/-9.0, and -15.0/-10.3 mm Hg for the groups assigned to placebo and nisoldipine CC 10, 20, and 30 mg, respectively. The response rates were 35%, 47%, and 63% for nisoldipine CC 10, 20, and 30 mg, respectively. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed that nisoldipine CC effectively controlled blood pressure throughout the dosing interval. No change in heart rate was seen for all three doses of nisoldipine CC over the 24-h dosing interval. Nisoldipine CC was at least as effective in black patients as in whites. Generally adverse events were not increased, except for peripheral edema, with rates of 7% in placebo, and 6%, 9%, and 19%, respectively, in those receiving nisoldipine CC 10, 20, or 30 mg daily. There were no clinically significant changes in blood lipids, blood glucose, or thyroid function. In conclusion, once-daily nisoldipine CC at doses of 10 to 30 mg was an effective and well tolerated antihypertensive agent, providing 24-h control of blood pressure without any increase in heart rate.",5,E

Several studies found that short-acting forms of calcium channel blockers were associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, malignancy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. A recent meta-analysis found a significant increase in the risk of mortality in patients treated with a short-acting form of nifedipine. Another subgroup analysis of an observational study of older hypertensive patients found a significantly increased risk of cancer and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients prescribed calcium channel blockers. Both in vitro and small human in vitro series have reported a potential for cardiac toxicity in pregnant women treated concomitantly with calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate. Until additional data are available, we suggest that when calcium channel blockers are used in obstetrics and gynecology, the long-acting variety be prescribed. Concurrent use of calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate should be undertaken cautiously because of the potential for synergistic depression of cardiac function.",4,E

We hypothesized that in postinfarct patients with CHF already prescribed diuretics and an ACE inhibitor, additional treatment with verapamil may reduce cardiac event rate. In this multicenter, double-blind study, patients with CHF receiving diuretic treatment were consecutively randomized to treatment with trandolapril 1 mg/day for 1 month and 2 mg/day the following 2 months (n = 49), or to trandolapril as mentioned plus verapamil 240 mg/day for 1 month and 360 mg/day for 2 months (n = 51).

Improvements in QL were observed in all randomized groups, including the placebo group during follow-up; greater improvements were observed in the acebutolol and chlorthalidone groups and were evident throughout follow-up. The amount of weight loss, increase in physical activity, and level of attained blood pressure control during follow-up were related to greater improvements in QL.; In patients with stage I hypertension, antihypertensive treatment with any of 5 agents used in TOMHS does not impair QL. The diuretic chlorthali-done and the cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol appear to improve QL the most. Success with lifestyle changes affecting weight loss and increase in physical activity relate to greater improvements in QL and show that these interventions, in addition to contributing to blood pressure control, have positive effects on the general well-being of the individual.",I,I

The data suggested that nifedipine affects the metabolism of fibroblasts derived not only from gingiva, but also from other collective connective tissues. Thus, nifedipine-responder cells are present in tissues other than gingiva. There was an inverse relationship between in vivo tissue levels of IL-1-beta and in vitro responsiveness to nifedipine of fibroblasts derived from that tissue.

Isradipine, a calcium channel entry blocker, has been used successfully in cyclosporine-induced hypertension.; Thirty leukemic patients who received cyclosporine after BMT were randomized to receive isradipine (0.005 mg/kg) from 72 hr before commencement of cyclosporine therapy until day 100 after BMT or placebo.; The placebo and isradipine groups were well matched. No differences were found between the isradipine and placebo groups in the level of blood pressure, renal function, marrow engraftment, or mortality. Hypertension incidence was surprisingly low (30% a week after hospital discharge and 10% by day 100 after BMT), and did not differ between the groups.; Isradipine does not harm immunohematopoietic reconstitution after BMT; therefore, it may be used in this setting, although the previously reported incidence of hypertension has been exaggerated.",5,E

Two years after randomization, the total mortality was 6.6% in the angina-guided strategy, 4.4% in the ischemia-guided strategy, and 1.1% in the revascularization strategy (P<.02). The rate of death or myocardial infarction was 12.1% in the angina-guided strategy, 8.8% in the ischemia-guided strategy, and 4.7% in the revascularization strategy (P<.04). The rate of death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent cardiac hospitalization was 41.8% in the angina-guided strategy, 38.5% in the ischemia-guided strategy, and 23.1% in the revascularization strategy (P<.001). Pairwise testing revealed significant differences between the revascularization and angina-guided strategies for each comparison.; A strategy of initial revascularization appears to improve the prognosis of this population compared with angina-guided medical therapy. A larger long-term study is needed to confirm this benefit and to adequately test the potential of more aggressive drug therapy.",6,E

Diltiazem-treated patients received a slow intravenous loading dose of 20 mg, followed by 10 mg intravenously every 4 hours for 24 to 36 hours, then 180 to 240 mg orally daily for 1 month. Digoxin-treated patients received a 1-mg intravenous loading in the first 24 to 36 hours, then 0.125 to 0.25 mg orally daily for 1 month. A concurrent prospective cohort of 40 patients without previous SVD, who did not participate in the study and underwent pneumonectomy or EPP without prophylaxis, served as a comparison group for SVD occurrence. Serial Doppler echocardiograms were performed to assess cardiac function and all patients were continuously monitored with Holter recorders for 3 days. Data were analyzed by intent-to-treat.; In patients undergoing standard or intrapericardial pneumonectomy, diltiazem prevented the overall incidence of postoperative SVD when compared with digoxin, 0 of 21 patients versus 8 of 25 patients, respectively, p < 0.005. When EPP patients were included in the analysis, diltiazem decreased the incidence of all SVD from 11 of 35 patients (31%) to 5 of 35 patients (14%) when compared with digoxin, p = 0.09. Digoxin-treated patients had a similar incidence of all SVD (31%) as concurrent controls (11 of 40 patients [28%]). The two treated groups did not differ in right or left atrial size, left ventricular ejection fraction, or right heart pressure. When all patients were combined, those in whom SVD developed were significantly older (65 +/- 12 years versus 55 +/- 11 years, p = 0.004) and had a longer median hospital stay (9 versus 6 days, p = 0.03), when compared with those in whom SVD did not develop, respectively. The subset of patients undergoing EPP had a greater incidence of atrial fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of postoperative pericarditis than all other pneumonectomy patients.; Diltiazem was both safe and more effective than digoxin in reducing the overall incidence of SVD after standard or intrapericardial pneumonectomy. Digoxin therapy had no effect on the incidence of postoperative SVD and is not recommended for prophylaxis of SVD. Dysrhythmias after pneumonectomy or EPP occur in older patients and are associated with a greater length of hospital stay.",I,6

Recent findings suggest that drug users are at increased risk for cancer in general and for colon cancer in particular. We conducted a study in one Danish county of 17911 patients who received at least one prescription of Ca2+ channel blockers between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 1993. The patients were identified from records in the National Health Insurance Program, which refunds part of the price of such drugs. Cancer occurrence and rate were determined by use of the files of the Danish Cancer Registry and compared with county-specific incidence rates for various categories of cancer. During the follow-up period of up to 3 years, 412 cancers were observed among users of Ca2+ channel blockers, compared with 414 expected, to yield an age- and sex-standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.10). There was no indication of an excess risk in the subgroup of likely long-term users or users of specific drugs. The SIR of colon cancer, a site of a priori interest, was 0.8 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.1) on the basis of 34 cases. Although the results are reassuring, the lack of association could reflect the relatively short follow-up after registration in the prescription database.

Fifty-two patients with documented exercise-induced angina pectoris and myocardial ischemia during 24-h electrocardiographic monitoring were included in the study. Forty-seven patients completed the 8-week treatment period, whereas five patients withdrew from the study. The mean number of ischemic episodes/24 h was reduced from 19.9 at baseline to 2.3 during amlodipine and to 2.4 during felodipine; the total duration of ischemic episodes decreased from 69.8 min/24 h to 15.2 min and 15.5 min during amlodipine and felodipine, respectively (for both variables, p = 0.83 and p = 0.53 between treatments, and for both treatments, p < 0.001 compared with baseline). Eighteen (38%) patients receiving amlodipine and 19 (40%) patients receiving felodipine showed no ST-segment depression during treatment. Maximal ST-depression was reduced from an average of 2.1 mm to 1.1 and 1.2 mm on amlodipine and felodipine, respectively (p = 0.68 between treatments and p < 0.001 compared with baseline). Mean heart rate remained unchanged compared with baseline. Anginal attacks were reduced from 16.4/week at baseline to 4.7/week with amlodipine and to 4.3/week with felodipine (p = 0.26 between treatments, and p < 0.001 vs. baseline). Accordingly, nitrate consumption was reduced from 14.7 capsules per week to 4.0 and 3.8 with amlodipine and felodipine, respectively (p = 0.40 between treatments, and p < 0.001 compared with baseline). Adverse reactions were infrequent and distributed similarly between the two treatments. It is concluded that both drugs effectively reduced ischemic episodes and anginal attacks and were well tolerated in patients with stable angina pectoris. There was no evidence that the two regimens were different in their antiischemic and antianginal properties.",I,E

After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 272 patients (age 49 +/- 9 years, mean +/- SD) with essential hypertension and a clinic diastolic blood pressure > or =100 mm Hg were randomized to verapamil, trandolapril, their fixed combination, or placebo for 8 weeks, according to a multicenter double-blind parallel group study design. Clinic and semiautomatic blood pressure at trough and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure were measured at the end of run-in period and after 8 weeks of treatment. In the 234 patients included in the efficacy analysis, run-in clinic and semiautomatic blood pressures were reduced by verapamil, trandolapril, and combined verapamil and trandolapril significantly more than by placebo. The reductions obtained with the combination were significantly greater than those obtained by verapamil alone. Twenty-four-hour average blood pressures were not modified by placebo and were reduced by 8/6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) by verapamil, 11/7 mm Hg by trandolapril, and 14/11 mm Hg by the combination of the two drugs. The differences between the effect of the combination and the combination components were, in most instances, statistically significant. The verapamil-trandolapril combination was more effective also on day average blood pressure and superior to the monotherapies for the trough-to-peak ratio of the antihypertensive effect as well. Twenty-four-hour heart rate was slightly but significantly reduced by verapamil and the reduction was manifest in the group taking verapamil plus trandolapril. Thus, the antihypertensive treatment with the fixed verapamil SR-trandolapril combination is more effective and balanced over the 24 hours than the effect of the combination components administered alone.",5,E

The three protocols significantly reduced mean blood pressure (128 v 107 mm Hg; 126 v 112 mm Hg; 129 v 104 mm Hg with IS, SP and IS + SP, respectively). ERPF and GFR did not change. UNaV increased significantly after IS (0.17 v 0.22 mEq/min) and IS + SP (0.18 v 0.24 mEq/min). UKal increased significantly after IS (58.6%) and IS + SP (53.6%). UAE decreased significantly only after SP. PRA increased significantly after IS (1.31 v 2.84 ng/mL/h), SP (1.10 v 2.15 ng/mL/h), and after IS + SP (1.23 v 3.21 ng/mL/min). In conclusion, IS, SP and IS + SP were effective in reducing blood pressure while keeping renal function stable. Only SP significantly decreased UAE. Enhanced UKal may have played a role in natriuresis observed after IS and IS + SP.",5,E

Information on safety can come from a variety of sources, in an ascending hierarchy, which is as follows: case-control studies, cohort studies, randomized control trials (RCTs), and metaanalyses based on good RCTs. Only in the case of metaanalyses are definite criteria for acceptability established, but evaluation of case-control and cohort studies remains subjective. Despite these reserves about the data sources, it is proposed that the case-control study pointing to the risk of acute myocardial infarction during therapy with short-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs) can be balanced out by another better more recent study, and by a large cohort study from Israel. In a very elderly population, a well-designed cohort study strongly suggests that short-acting nifedipine can be linked to increased mortality and that the specific links may be with a high dose and when the initial BP is less than 160/90 mm Hg. However, initial BP was only available in an unspecified number of patients. The risk of using short-acting verapamil was no more than that of beta-blockade. These differences can be attributed at least in part to the low catecholamine profile of verapamil and the marked rapid adrenergic activation with short-acting nifedipine, which could also explain the adverse effects found when this agent is given to patients with acute coronary syndromes. During the chronic use of long-acting dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs, most evidence suggests that there is little or no catecholamine activation, or in the case of amlodipine, even a decrease in plasma catecholamine levels. These differences may explain why the expected regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is obtained with long- but not short-acting DHPs. At present the results of several large randomized controlled trials with long-acting CCBs are awaited. In the meantime, when the decision has been made to use a CCB, the preferential choice is for the use of a non-DHP for hypertension with clinical ischemia or for postinfarct hypertension, for a long-acting CCB for the control of left ventricular hypertrophy, and for the DHP amlodipine when there is associated depression of myocardial function.",I,E

Patients volunteered for the study.; After a 2 to 4 week, single-blind, placebo baseline period, patients with SDBP of 95-115 mm Hg were randomized to treatment with felodipine ER 2.5 mg qd or placebo at a ratio of 3:1, felodipine:placebo. The dose of felodipine ER was increased to 5 mg qd after 3 weeks and to 10 mg qd after 6 weeks if the SDBP was greater than 90 mm Hg.; The main outcome measure was change in SDBP. Secondary Outcome measures were change in sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) and percent of responders, defined as SDBP less than 90 mm Hg or a > or = 10 mm Hg reduction. Other measurements included heart rate, weight, routine laboratory values, and self-reported adverse events.; By Week 9, felodipine ER reduced blood pressure in the older subjects (n = 77) by 13/12 mm Hg; in the younger patients, (n = 102), the reduction was 12/8 mm Hg. All reductions were significantly different from placebo (P < or = .003). The reduction in diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure was significantly greater in the older than in the younger patients (P = .004 and P = .188, respectively). The percentage of patients reporting a clinical adverse experience was similar for felodipine ER and placebo treatment groups. The incidence of side effects was similar between old and young patients. Discontinuation occurred in 9% of the felodipine-treated patients and 19% of the placebo-treated patients. Older patients required lower doses of felodipine ER to achieve equivalent blood pressure control.; Felodipine ER is effective in lowering blood pressure and is well tolerated in both young and old people.",5,E

We have compared the pulmonary vasodilator effects, dose-response characteristics, and tolerability of two calcium channel blockers, amlodipine and extended-release (ER) felodipine, in 10 patients (seven men, age 68+/-4.8 [SD] years) with clinically stable COPD and PH.; Drugs were given in equal single daily oral doses (2.5, 5, and 10 mg), increasing weekly for 3 weeks, in a randomized investigator-blinded crossover manner with a 1-week wash-out period between the two treatments.; Doppler measurements of pulmonary hemodynamics were made on the seventh day of treatment at each drug dose. Lung function, arterial blood gases, and adverse events were also monitored weekly.; A dose-dependent decline of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was observed with each drug. A dose of 2.5 mg produced a significant decrease in PAP compared with baseline (20% amlodipine, 17% felodipine ER). Additional decreases in PAP were observed at 5 mg and 10 mg that were similar for both drugs, but did not reach statistical significance compared with 2.5 mg. There was a dose-related decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and increase in oxygen delivery with amlodipine and felodipine ER. Lung function and blood gas values were stable throughout. Side effects (headache and ankle edema) were less frequent during amlodipine treatment (p<0.05).; Both amlodipine and felodipine ER, given as a single daily oral dose of > or = 2.5 mg, are effective pulmonary vasodilators in COPD patients with PH. Their dose-response characteristics are similar, but amlodipine treatment was associated with fewer side effects.",5,E

Although intravenous administration of this drug has been reported to be effective in the treatment of heart failure, the optimal dose by this route is not clear. This study was designed to determine the optimum dose for the intravenous infusion of nicardipine in the treatment of heart failure. In Trial 1, nicardipine was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.5 microgram/kg per min to 14 patients with acute heart failure. The dose was increased to 1.0 microgram/kg per min in 13 cases with marked improvement at 2 h. In Trial 2, nicardipine was administered in a double-blind manner to 53 patients at 3 different rates of infusion for 2 h: 1.0 (Group 1, n = 19), 2.0 (Group 2, n = 15), and 3.0 (Group 3, n = 19) micrograms/kg per min. Neither heart rate nor mean right atrial pressure changed in any of the 3 groups. Favorable hemodynamic effects were evident in all groups beginning 30 min after the start of infusion, with an increase in cardiac index (control vs 2 h after infusion, L/min per m2) (Group 1: 2.2 +/- 0.4 vs 3.1 +/- 0.8, Group 2: 2.2 +/- 0.4 vs 2.9 +/- 0.5, Group 3: 2.3 +/- 0.3 vs 3.1 +/- 0.7, all p < 0.01 compared to the control) and a decrease in diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (Group 1: 26 +/- 10 vs 19 +/- 7, Group 2: 27 +/- 10 vs 20 +/- 8, Group 3: 26 +/- 7 vs 18 +/- 5 mmHg, all p < 0.01). The decrease in systolic pressure was greatest in Group 3 (Group 1: 141 +/- 31 vs 119 +/- 18, Group 2: 149 +/- 25 vs 118 +/- 17, Group 3; 147 +/- 27 vs 107 +/- 14 mmHg, all p < 0.01 compared to control, and p < 0.05 between Groups 1 and 3). The intravenous drip infusion of nicardipine is effective in the treatment of heart failure by inducing an increase in cardiac output and a decrease in pulmonary artery wedge pressure. The optimal dose in this study was 1.0 microgram/kg per min.",6,E

However, there are few data to support this contention. The present study used a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design to contrast the effects of 6 weeks treatment with alpha-methyldopa and the combination of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride with that of amlodipine and the combined diuretics in a group of 24 newly diagnosed patients with primary hypertension. All-night polysomnography was performed before the initiation of therapy (baseline) and at the end of the two treatment periods. Respiratory variables failed to reveal any significant differences between the treatments and baseline, or between the two different treatment regimens. The two treatment regimens achieved similar reductions in blood pressure. The prevalence of SAH was 25% before treatment, which is comparable to a prevalence of 20% in a similar group drawn from the same population but receiving various antihypertensive medications. The findings of this study are in agreement with previous reports using other classes of antihypertensive drugs that also failed to detect any tendency for increases in nocturnal respiratory disturbance indices over assessment periods of 8 weeks or shorter.",5,E

We studied 19 patients (17 males and 2 females; mean age 57 +/- 6.8 years) with stable effort angina, angiographically documented coronary artery disease and reversible perfusion defects during exercise thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy of at least one segment of the left ventricle. After 2 weeks of a single-blind placebo run-in period, during which each patient underwent at least 2 exercise tests and a 48-hour Holter ECG recording, all patients were treated with either placebo or gallopamil 50 mg t.i.d. for 28 days. At the end of this period, patients crossed over to the alternate regimen. This phase was double blind. After treatment with placebo or gallopamil, patients underwent exercise tests, 24-hour Holter ECG recording and thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy. Weekly angina frequency and trinitroglycerin (TNT) consumption and safety were also evaluated. No patients dropped out of the study because of major side effects. The number of total ischemic and symptomatic events recorded at 24-hour ECG monitoring, weekly angina frequency and TNT consumption were significantly reduced during gallopamil treatment. After gallopamil administration, exercise duration significantly increased (run-in: 419 +/- 116 s, placebo: 420 +/- 118 s, gallopamil: 511 +/- 144 s; p < 0.05), and ST segment depression was significantly reduced (run-in: -1.3 +/- 0.3 mm, placebo: -1.3 +/- 0.3 mm, gallopamil: -0.94 +/- 0.68 mm; p < 0.01), while heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product were unchanged at rest, at submaximal and at peak exercise. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of myocardial perfusion and the myocardial uptake percentage of thallium-201 in ischemic zones were significantly improved by gallopamil treatment. These findings demonstrate that gallopamil can improve myocardial perfusion and reduce myocardial oxygen consumption.",3,E

However, blood flow and flow reserve of normally perfused myocardium subtended by bypass grafts have not been evaluated late after surgery. Also, it is unknown whether pharmacologic vasodilation evokes comparable myocardial flow responses in arterial and venous conduits. Myocardial blood flow was quantified at rest and during dipyridamole hyperemia using N-13 ammonia and positron emission tomography (PET) in 15 patients 9 +/- 3 years after bypass surgery and in 10 healthy volunteers. Blood flow was analyzed in 26 territories subtended by bypass grafts with normal wall motion and normal perfusion. Myocardial blood flow at rest did not differ between patients and controls (0.65 +/- 0.14 vs 0.68 +/- 0.16 ml/ g/min) and was similar in normal myocardium subtended by saphenous vein (n = 16) and internal mammary artery grafts (n = 10; 0.64 +/- 0.13 vs 0.66 +/- 0.15 ml/g/min). However, the hyperemic response in normal myocardium supplied by bypass grafts was less than that in controls (1.61 +/- 0.33 vs 2.04 +/- 0.30 ml/g/min, p <0.005). No differences between territories supplied by venous and arterial conduits were observed (1.61 +/- 0.35 vs 1.63 +/- 0.32 ml/g/min). Normal myocardium subtended by bypass grafts exhibited a lower flow reserve than that in controls (2.54 +/- 0.51 vs 3.16 +/- 0.85, p <0.02). Myocardial flow reserve was almost identical in regions supplied by venous and arterial grafts (2.55 +/- 0.48 vs 2.52 +/- 0.58). The similar reduction in vasodilatory capacity together with the normal PET polar map findings during dipyridamole argue against flow limiting stenoses in both venous and arterial bypass conduits late after revascularization. Rather, nonobstructive proliferative fibrointimal changes of the bypass conduits or atherosclerosis of the native resistance vessels might account for this finding.",5,E

Its scope is to investigate the effects of modern antihypertensive drug treatment on morbidity and mortality and to assess possible adverse effects of the drugs used. Patients were recruited in 22 countries in western and eastern Europe and Israel. At three run-in visits 1 month apart their sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) on single-blind placebo treatment averaged 180-219 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for sex and the presence of cardiovascular complications, the patients were randomized either to active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), titrated or combined to reduce the sitting SBP by at least 20 mm Hg to below 150 mm Hg. Matching placebos were employed similarly. The present progress report is based on the data received at the Coordinating Office before 1 March 1996. At that time 3433 subjects had been randomized. A total of 2015 patients had been followed for at least 1 year on double-blind treatment and 1298 patients for at least 2 years.

We postulated that TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels may also have predictive value in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).; The molecular mechanism for progression of CHF may involve cytokine overexpression. The effect of amlodipine on cytokine levels in patients with CHF is unknown.; In the Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation (PRAISE) trial, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure plasma levels of TNF-alpha in 92 patients and IL-6 in 62 patients in New York Heart Association functional classes III and IV randomized to receive amlodipine (10 mg/day) or placebo. Blood samples were obtained for cytokine measurement at baseline and at 8 and 26 weeks after enrollment.; The baseline amlodipine and placebo groups did not differ in demographics and cytokine levels. Mean (+/- SD) plasma levels of TNF-alpha were 5.69 +/- 0.32 pg/ml, and those of IL-6 were 9.23 +/- 1.26 pg/ml at baseline. These levels were elevated 6 and 10 times, respectively, compared with those of normal subjects (p < 0.001). Levels of TNF-alpha did not change significantly over the 26-week period (p = 0.69). However, IL-6 levels were significantly lower at 26 weeks in patients treated with amlodipine versus placebo (p = 0.007 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test). An adverse event-CHF or death-occurred more commonly in patients with higher IL-6 levels.; Amlodipine lowers plasma IL-6 levels in patients with CHF. The beneficial effect of amlodipine in CHF may be due to a reduction of cytokines such as IL-6.",I,E

Blood pressures, heart rates, P-R intervals; and serum concentrations of R-/S-verapamil and norverapamil were measured multiple times in patients during the last day of each therapy. Median blood pressure decreased more with generic verapamil than with the brand-name drug, with the largest difference occurring at 0.5 hours (137/74 mmHg versus 144.5/80.5 mmHg; P = 0.05 and 0.091, respectively). Pharmacokinetic parameters were not different for the two products (P < 0.01). However, the generic product, compared with the brand-name drug, had mean area under the concentration-time curve (time 0 to 12 hours) ratios (90% CI) of 1.09 (0.78-1.52), 1.16 (0.87-1.55) and 1.11 (0.81-1.52) for R-, S-, and total verapamil. Seventy concentration peaks (31 with the brand-name drug, 39 with the generic drug) appeared between 8 and 24 hours. Median percentages of increase of these peaks, compared with those of previous concentrations, were 48.3% and 36.3% for brand-name and generic drugs, respectively. Fifty of the 70 peaks (71%) were associated with a stereospecific concentration peak of norverapamil and, temporally, with meals. Our findings suggest that whereas the two verapamil products may not be bioequivalent by Food and Drug Administration criteria, the observed differences in effects were not clinically significant in this elderly population. Multiple concentration peaks after absorption were observed in all patients with both verapamil products and were perhaps related to enterohepatic recirculation.",3,E

In the present study we used dextroamphetamine administered to humans as a model of mania, to determine whether the calcium antagonist diltiazem would prevent dextroamphetamine-induced changes. This may help determine whether diltiazem is likely to be useful in the treatment of mania. Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced crossover study. Subjects received either oral diltiazem (60 mg) and placebo, placebo and dextroamphetamine (20 mg), diltiazem and dextroamphetamine, or placebo alone. Subjective and sleep changes were measured using visual analogue scales. Attentiveness and visual reaction times were measured repeatedly as were diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The results showed that dextroamphetamine alone produced a number of subjective changes, cardiovascular changes and changes in reaction time. Diltiazem significantly attenuated the cardiovascular changes, but not the subjective or reaction time changes. It is hypothesized that these findings may represent effects of diltiazem on noradrenergic neurotransmission. The results are tentatively supportive of suggestions that diltiazem may be clinically useful in the treatment of mania, as is another calcium channel antagonist, verapamil.",2,E

Unadjusted odds ratios for nifedipine versus controls were 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-1.09) for definitive events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, revascularization procedure) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.31-1.17) for all events (definitive plus increased angina). The odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy (sustained- or extended-release in 91% of exposures) was nonsignificantly higher for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.49-4.03 and odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.59-3.32, respectively). The odds ratio for nifedipine in combination with another drug was significantly lower for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.66 and odds ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.65, respectively). Differences in odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy and combined therapy were statistically significant (P=.02 for definitive events and P=.001 for all events). Results support the safety of sustained- and extended-release nifedipine in the treatment of mild or moderate hypertension when it is used in combination with other drugs.",I,I

In addition to the hypotensive effects of combinations of both drugs compared with monotherapy, all given once daily, the effect on quality of life was also evaluated. This study consisted of a 3 x 2 multifactorial design in which 156 women and men with a sitting diastolic pressure of between 95 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg, after a 4-week placebo washout phase, were randomized to one of six treatment groups for 12 weeks of active treatment. Monotherapy with diltiazem 120 or 240 mg produced increasing reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared with placebo, lisinopril 10 mg had an effect intermediate between the diltiazem doses. The combinations of diltiazem 240 mg + lisinopril 10 mg and diltiazem 120 mg + lisinopril 10 mg showed increased efficacy in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to these drug doses used in monotherapy, but the effect of the combinations was less than predicted by an additive model. Although the total number of other adverse events reported was similar for all active treatment groups compared to placebo, lisinopril-induced cough was common with an incidence of 31% after rechallenge. Premature drug withdrawal was necessary in four of 78 patients receiving lisinopril, due to intractable cough. The combination of diltiazem 240 mg and lisinopril 10 mg was significantly more effective at reducing blood pressure than either drug alone; this additive effect did not result in a higher rate of adverse effects or impairment of quality of life. Thus, combination therapy with these agents was well tolerated and resulted in increased efficacy in these elderly patients.",5,E

We also evaluated the tolerability of both drugs. Sixty patients (42 males, 18 females, mean age 52 +/- 4 years) in renal failure maintained on haemodialysis, with coronary artery disease and more than four significant episodes of transient myocardial ischemia (> or = 1 min) during 48-hour Holter monitoring, were included in the study. All cardiovascular drugs were discontinued > or = 6 days before this 48-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, with the exception of sublingual nitrates allowed for relief of anginal attacks. Patients were then randomized to receive either bisoprolol or nifedipine for 2 weeks. After a 15-day wash-out period, they were crossed over to receive either bisoprolol or nifedipine for other 2 weeks. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Student's t test. A p value < 0.01 was considered significant. Both bisoprolol and nifedipine reduced number and duration of transient ischemic episodes as well as the total ischemic burden. Reductions were statistically significant for both antianginal drugs. Only bisoprolol was effective in silent ischemia (p < 0.001). It also reduced heart rate (p < 0.001), while nifedipine raised it (p < 0.001). Both drugs reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The circadian variations of transient ischemic episodes showed two peaks in the 24 hours. Both peaks were reduced with bisoprolol. Nifedipine brought a clear overall reduction in the number of episodes but the circadian pattern was unchanged. During the study, 10 patients taking bisoprolol and 12 patients taking nifedipine had drug adverse effects. No one of them had to be withdrawn from treatment. In conclusion, bisoprolol seems to be more useful than nifedipine because its effects, in transient ischemic episodes, are greatly superior to those of nifedipine, and because it is effective also in silent ischemia. Both drugs showed a good tolerability in these patients. Bisoprolol, reducing the two daily peaks of ischemic episodes frequency, has a protective role towards mortality due to coronary artery disease.",1,E

Switches to diltiazem and verapamil have been described; however, these drugs are of a different chemical class and present therapeutic limitations in some patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect on nifedipine-induced GH of a switch to a dihydropyridine derivative with a low incidence of GH. Fourteen patients with nifedipine-induced GH were given a medical exam and a periodontal exam. The following parameters were assessed: probing depth (PD), gingival margin (GM), gingival thickness (GT), plaque index (PI), and gingival index (GI). Intraoral photographs, study models, and a gingival biopsy for histological examination were taken. Following baseline measures, patients were randomized to continued treatment with nifedipine or an equivalent dose of isradipine in a single-blind fashion. Biweekly periodontal parameters were taken for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, some patients elected to receive 4 weeks of open label isradipine therapy, with biweekly examination continuing through the open label phase. The isradipine treatment arm showed a mean decrease in PD of 0.59 mm at week 8 (P < 0.05). No other measured parameter (GM, GT, PI, GI) was significantly changed, compared either to baseline or to the alternate treatment arm. Clinically, 60% of patients treated with isradipine exhibited a decrease in hyperplasia, while 66% of patients treated with nifedipine demonstrated an increase in hyperplasia, a significant difference (P < 0.05). When combined with open label data, patients switching therapy to isradipine exhibited an increase in GM (increase in recession) of 0.74 mm from baseline to week 12 (P < 0.05). No patients treated with isradipine exhibited an increase in gingival overgrowth. All patients exhibited adequate control of hypertension. We conclude that in hypertensive patients with nifedipine-induced GH, switching hypertensive therapy to isradipine may result in a regression of GH. When coupled with aggressive oral hygiene treatment, this drug may provide a reasonable option for patients requiring dihydropyridine treatment.",2,E

The purpose of this study was to examine a large group of patients taking amlodipine and determine the prevalence of gingival hyperplasia. One hundred fifty dentate patients who had been taking amlodipine, 5 mg per day for at least 6 months, volunteered to undergo a screening examination for gingival hyperplasia. Mild hyperplasia (< 1/3 clinical crown) was found in five patients-a prevalence of 3.3%. This is significantly less (P < .001) than rates reported for patients taking nifedipine, and not significantly different from rates previously reported in control groups of cardiac patients not taking calcium channel blockers. The results from this group of patients indicated that amlodipine, 5 mg per day, did not induce gingival hyperplasia.",2,E

However, there is considerable debate about whether long-acting calcium antagonists as well as the short-acting calcium antagonists have the same effect. Barnidipine-HCl is a newly-developed calcium antagonist with 1:2 short- and long-acting particles. This study evaluated the changes of autonomic tone due to barnidipine. Both the short- and long-acting effect of the calcium antagonist was evaluated. Eleven patients with primary hypertension underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram and blood pressure monitoring before and after the treatment with barnidipine. Heart rate and blood pressure were compared before and after the medication. Heart rate variability was analyzed with a Marquette 8000/T. High frequency power (HF), as a parameter of vagal tone, and the ratio to low frequency power (LF), as a parameter of sympathetic tone, were obtained. Twenty-four-hour average blood pressure decreased significantly during the day, but nocturnal hypotension was not observed. Heart rate did not increase. HF decreased at the peak of the short- and long-acting components. LF/HF increased at the peak of the short-acting component. Short-acting particles of barnidipine had a deleterious effect on the autonomic tone, that is overactivation of sympathetic tone and suppression of vagal tone. Long-acting particles of barnidipine suppressed the vagal tone. These findings suggest that short-acting calcium antagonists may cause arrhythmia or deterioration of coronary ischemia.",1,E

Patients who were found to have 200 > SBP > 160 and 120 > DBP > 90 mmHg as the previous day of surgery, as well as patients who did not receive any anti-hypertensive treatment regimen during the last week before surgery, were selected. Five min before performing local anesthesia, a continuous infusion of nifedipine at two different rates of 0.65 mg/h and 1.25 mg/h, was administered in groups A and B respectively, whereas group C received a placebo.

Atenolol, a cardio-selective beta-blocker, has been shown to be a safe and effective antihypertensive agent. The extended-release form of felodipine (felodipine ER), a vascular-selective dihydropyridine calcium blocker, is extensively used in Caucasians. However, its effectiveness, tolerability and adverse side-effect have not been assessed in Chinese populations.; Sitting blood pressure (BP), heart rate, body weight, adverse reaction and serum biochemistry were assessed in 70 patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension treated either with felodipine ER (37 patients), or atenolol (33 patients) for 10 weeks. Each patient was prescribed 5 mg of felodipine ER or 50 mg of atenolol once daily and this daily dosage was doubled to twice daily if necessary.; Six patients who received felodipine ER and 3 who received atenolol withdrew from the treatment because of intolerable side effects. Within ten weeks, 81.1% of the patients had responded to a total daily dosage of 5-10 mg of felodipine ER and 81.8% to a daily dose of 50-100 mg of atenolol. By the end of treatment, the mean BP in the felodipine ER group had decreased from 176/104 mmHg at baseline to 145/85 mmHg, while the BP in the atenolol group had dropped from 173/103 mmHg to 145/84 mmHg (NS between the two groups).

These drugs were found to inhibit expression of mannose-ligand binding receptors, thus preventing spermatozoa from attaching to the zona pellucida; they were postulated to cause failed fertilization based on one case having this defect, in whom a return to normal was achieved after stopping the drug. However, the couple did not undergo a cycle with IVF to see if fertilization now occurred. The data presented here demonstrated fertilization in all patients having IVF who were taking calcium channel blockers. The subsequent pregnancy rate per transfer was 17.4%. Also, five out of 11 (45.4%) non-IVF patients conceived after correction of various female factors. Failure of the other six patients to conceive could be explained by other confounding factors, especially oligoasthenozoospermia. Taking into consideration other data suggesting poor fertilization when this mannose-ligand binding receptor abnormality was demonstrated, we propose the possibility that this defect, when not associated with calcium channel blockers, may be associated with some other cryptic factor that causes poor fertilization. According to our hypothesis, calcium channel blockers might cause the problem in mannose expression but also adversely affect some other factor that is deficient when non-drug related abnormalities in mannose-ligand binding expression are found.",2,E

There was no difference in the response of any variable during baroreflex perturbations after amlodipine administration compared with control and placebo tests. One subject who tolerated head-down tilt coupled with phenylephrine administration during the control and placebo tests became markedly short of breath during the same intervention after amlodipine administration. Plasma NE levels in this patient had risen markedly while receiving amlodipine and were not appropriately suppressed during the baroreflex loading maneuver.; Short-term therapy with amlodipine does not suppress sympathetic activity or alter efferent responses to baroreflex perturbation in patients with stable chronic CHF.

9284842,Calcium channel blockers: an evidence-based review.,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Calcium Channel Blockers; Diltiazem; Humans; Myocardial Infarction; Nifedipine; Verapamil,"Waters, D","Calcium channel blockers are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but their proper therapeutic role is controversial. Nevertheless, drugs from this class have been evaluated in many controlled clinical trials of adequate size and duration in different patient populations. Although many important questions remain unanswered, these trials have clarified when and how these drugs should be used. In general, the benefits of calcium channel blockers in controlling angina and hypertension are much more clearly documented than are their long term effects on harder end-points such as mortality. Such long term data are sorely needed, particularly for hypertension. An increased risk with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers has been clearly seen across several studies of patients with coronary disease. In coronary patients with heart failure, the deleterious effects of nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil outweigh any possible benefit. Long acting formulations and newer calcium channel blockers may not share all of the adverse effects of the older drugs of this class; however, their long term safety has not yet been documented. An understanding of the limitations of calcium channel blockers, based upon clinical trial evidence, often leads the practitioner to choose a drug from another class, where efficacy has been clearly proven.",I,E

Because of the increased risk of myocardial ischemia in the morning hours, it has been suggested that the administration of anti-ischemic medication before bedtime may be more effective than the traditional morning dosing. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluated the effects of 480-mg/day diltiazem (given either in the A.M. or the P.M.) on myocardial ischemia using ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in 68 patients with chronic stable angina and > or = 2 minutes of ischemia per 48 hours. During treatment with diltiazem, the duration and number of myocardial ischemic episodes were reduced by 45% (94 to 52 minutes, p <0.004) and by 40% (4.5 to 2.7 episodes, p <0.003), respectively. The duration and number of myocardial ischemic episodes during daytime (6 A.M. to 6 P.M.) hours were also reduced by 52% (74 to 36 minutes, p <0.002) and by 48% (3.1 to 1.6 episodes, p <0.001), respectively. There was no significant difference between A.M. and P.M. dosing. Morning ischemia (6 A.M. to noon), considered separately from daytime ischemia, was also significantly reduced by both A.M. and P.M. dosing regimens, with no difference between the regimens. The results of this study showed that both A.M. and P.M. dosing of long-acting diltiazem were equally effective in suppressing episodes of ambulatory myocardial ischemia at all times.",I,E

We evaluated the effects of a chronotherapeutic delivery system of controlled-onset extended-release (COER) verapamil hydrochloride and placebo in 257 hypertensive patients according to their circadian BP pattern in an 8-week prospective, multicenter, randomized, and double-blind clinical trial. Patients were stratified into 193 dippers (>10% decline in BP during the period of 10 P.M. to 5 A.M. compared with the hours of 5 A.M. to 10 P.M.) and 64 nondippers (<10% decline in BP during nighttime). During daytime, placebo-subtracted BP was similarly decreased in dippers and nondippers by COER verapamil. During nighttime, the placebo increased nocturnal BP in dippers (baseline nocturnal BP, 133/78 mm Hg) by 3/3 +/- 2/2 mm Hg and reduced BP by -5/-3 +/- 2/2 mm Hg in nondippers (baseline nocturnal BP, 152/94 mm Hg) (p = NS between groups). After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, and the regression to the mean observed on placebo for all doses, COER verapamil reduced nocturnal BP more in nondippers than dippers -5.8/-2.4 mm Hg, p <0.0001 for systolic BP and p = 0.09 for diastolic BP). Additionally, a significant dose-related reduction in systolic and diastolic nocturnal BP (r = 0.56, p <0.0001 for systolic BP and r = 0.62, p <0.0001 for diastolic BP) was observed with COER verapamil after controlling for baseline covariates.

In 1989, the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly investigated whether active treatment could reduce cardiovascular complications of isolated systolic hypertension. Fatal and non-fatal stroke combined was the primary endpoint.; All patients (> 60 years) were initially started on masked placebo. At three run-in visits 1 month apart, their average sitting systolic blood pressure was 160-219 mm Hg with a diastolic blood pressure lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for centre, sex, and previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients were randomly assigned to nitrendipine 10-40 mg daily, with the possible addition of enalapril 5-20 mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-25.0 mg daily, or matching placebos. Patients withdrawing from double-blind treatment were still followed up. We compared occurrence of major endpoints by intention to treat.; At a median of 2 years' follow-up, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures had fallen by 13 mm Hg and 2 mm Hg in the placebo group (n = 2297) and by 23 mm Hg and 7 mm Hg in the active treatment group (n = 2398). The between-group differences were systolic 10.1 mm Hg (95% CI 8.8-11.4) and diastolic, 4.5 mm Hg (3.9-5.1). Active treatment reduced the total rate of stroke from 13.7 to 7.9 endpoints per 1000 patient-years (42% reduction; p = 0.003). Non-fatal stroke decreased by 44% (p = 0.007).

Left ventricular mass, cardiac function at rest and during submaximal exercise, and physical performance were assessed in 38 elderly patients with hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy and normal systolic function before and after 8 and 14 months of therapy with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide or both. Blood pressure control was achieved with amlodipine in 18 patients, with hydrochlorothiazide in seven, and with the combination of these drugs in 13. Left ventricular mass index was similarly reduced from approximately 150 to approximately 100 g/m2 at 14 months' in each treatment group. Systolic function was maintained with the three treatment regimens, whereas similar decreases in time to peak filling rate and increases in first-third filling fraction occurred both at rest and during submaximal exercise after 8 months and further after 14 months of therapy. Exercise capacity did not significantly change in the group as a whole, but individual changes in peak oxygen uptake at the end of treatment correlated significantly with the decrease in time to peak filling rate during submaximal exercise (r = -0.49; p < 0.01). It is concluded that long-term blood pressure control with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide or both is associated with significant reductions in left ventricular mass and improved diastolic function in elderly patients with hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy. Despite this reduction in left ventricular mass, left ventricular systolic function and physical performance are well preserved during submaximal exercise.",5,E

The purpose of this single-blind study was to assess the impact of salt sensitivity on the antihypertensive effects of isradipine. A total of 21 evaluable hypertensive patients (10 white, 11 black) 35 to 73 years of age (mean 55.9 years) were randomized to a low-salt diet (mean 24-hour urine sodium 100+/-14 mmol) or a high-salt diet (mean 24-hour urine sodium 210+/-22 mmol) for 7 weeks, followed by crossover to the other diet after a 2-week washout period. On each diet regimen, patients received placebo for 2 weeks, followed by optimal titration of isradipine (2.5 to 10 mg BID) for blood pressure control during the last 5 weeks. On the high-salt diet, salt-sensitive hypertensives (mean arterial blood pressure increase > or = 5 mm Hg, n=5) exhibited a systolic/diastolic blood pressure change of -18.7/-19.6 mm Hg from 157.2/102.9 mm Hg after 5 weeks of isradipine treatment, whereas on a low-salt diet, blood pressure change was -6.9/-12.0 mm Hg from 148.7/97.3 mm Hg. Non-salt-sensitive patients (n=16) exhibited a systolic/diastolic blood pressure change of -12.6/-7.6 mm Hg from 155.3/98.6 mm Hg on the high-salt diet and -19.2/-10.9 mm Hg from 161.0/102.6 mm Hg on the low-salt diet after treatment with isradipine. The absolute blood pressure attained in both salt-sensitive and non-salt-sensitive patients was almost identical with isradipine therapy despite variation in dietary salt, although slightly higher doses of isradipine were required in the salt-sensitive group. Consequently, isradipine, and perhaps calcium antagonists in general, manifests a more robust blood pressure-lowering effect in the setting of high sodium intake. This effect does, however, appear to be largely confined to individuals who are salt sensitive.",5,E

Blood pressure (BP) was assessed at 10 min intervals for 6 h after administration. After 6 h, the BP falls induced by these drugs were still significantly lower than the baseline placebo values. Hypotensive effect of nifedipine-capsules was established more rapidly than that of captopril in both white and black patients, and of nifedipine-retard in black patients. Considering the area under the curve of BP values during the 6-h treatment, the overall hypotensive effect of nifedipine-capsules was similar to captopril in white patients, but significantly more pronounced than captopril and nifedipine-retard in black patients. In white patients similar maximal drops of BP (mean+/-s.e.m.) were obtained with nifedipine-capsules (71+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) and with captopril (69+/-4/50+/-3 mm Hg). In black patients the maximal drop of BP of nifedipine-capsules (70+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) was greater (P < 0.02) than that of captopril (48+/-4/32+/-3 mm Hg) but similar to that of nifedipine-retard (71+/-4/49+/-4 mm Hg). However, in contrast to nifedipine-capsules and captopril, nifedipine-retard produced a slower drop in BP. The time of peak drop in BP of both nifedipine-capsules and captopril occurred within the first 2 h whereas with nifedipine-retard it occurred only between 4 and 6 h after administration. Fewer patients reported side effects with nifedipine-retard as compared with the other two preparations. We conclude that single doses of captopril and nifedipine reduces BP for at least 6 h in both white and black patients with hypertensive crisis, but nifedipine is more potent than captopril in black patients. The slow release form of nifedipine-retard effectively and safely lowers BP while achieving a rapid enough effect without the critical rapid falls in BP that occur with nifedipine-capsules.",1,E

At baseline and subsequently at the end of third, sixth, and twelfth months, each patient underwent an integrated echocardiographic study and noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Both drugs significantly reduced blood pressure, casual or monitored (p < 0.01), and left ventricular mass index (from 125 +/- 32 to 100 +/- 12 gm/m2 [p < 0.02] with amlodipine and from 106 +/- 18 to 89 +/- 10 gm/m2 [p < 0.02] with fosinopril). The decrease in left ventricular mass was essentially caused by a reduction of ventricular thickness. Free right ventricular wall thickness was also lowered in both groups, more consistently with amlodipine (from 8.0 +/- 2.1 to 6.4 +/- 0.8 mm; p < 0.01), without an increase in plasma natriuretic peptide and insulin concentrations or heart rate. With both treatments, the decrease in ventricular mass was not associated with impairment of systolic function, whereas a trend toward an improvement of Doppler echocardiographic indexes of biventricular diastolic function was observed. In conclusion, both amlodipine and fosinopril induced similar qualitative effects on anatomy and function of both ventricles. The clinical meaning of these observations must be defined further by means of adequately sized prospective trials.",5,E

Its vasodilatory activity combined with an ability to lower heart rate without negative inotropic effects as well as its long duration of action make it a promising anti-ischemic agent.; Three hundred nine patients with coronary artery disease, stable angina pectoris, and positive exercise tests were randomized to receive mibefradil (50, 100, or 150 mg), amlodipine (10 mg), or placebo. The anti-ischemic effects of mibefradil on exercise test and silent ischemia parameters were assessed. At doses of 100 and 150 mg, mibefradil increased exercise duration (by 55.5 and 51.0 seconds, respectively; P<.001 for both), increased time to onset of angina (by 98.3 and 82.7 seconds, respectively; P<.001), and increased time to 1-mm ST depression (by 81.7 and 94.3 seconds, respectively; P<.001). By comparison, a 10 mg/d dose of amlodipine significantly improved only time to onset of angina (treatment effect: 38.5 seconds, P=.036). Mibefradil 100 mg and 150 mg decreased the number of episodes of silent ischemia (treatment effects: -3.1 and -3.6, respectively; P<.001) and the duration of silent ischemia (treatment effects: -9.2 minutes, P=.048, and -14.6 minutes, P=.002, respectively). The decrease in the number of episodes of silent ischemia was also statistically significant in the group receiving 10 mg of amlodipine (-1.5; P=.036).; Once-daily doses of 100 and 150 mg mibefradil were effective in improving exercise tolerance and reducing ischemic episodes during ambulatory monitoring in patients with coronary artery disease.",I,E

Before completion of the study, 3 patients in the drug group withdrew because of the severity of their symptoms and 1 patient assigned to the Abl+Pm group in whom the ablation procedure failed. At the end of the 6 months, the 21 patients of the Abl+Pm group who completed the study showed, in comparison with the 18 of the drug group, lower scores in the Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (-51%, P=.0006), palpitations (-71%, P=.0000), effort dyspnea (-36%, P=.04), exercise intolerance score (-46%, P=.001), and easy fatigue (-51%, P=.02).

There are two main aims of the study. The first is to evaluate the relationship between three levels of target diastolic blood pressure (< or = 90, < or = 85 or < or = 80 mmHg) and the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. The second is to determine the effect on morbidity and mortality of a low dose, 75 mg daily, of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) compared with placebo. Altogether 18,790 patients have been recruited and randomized, and two-year data are now available for all patients. This is a report on the blood pressures achieved, the tolerability, and other available data after 24 months of follow-up of all patients. Special emphasis is given to the subgroup of elderly patients (> or = 65 years, n = 5988) compared with young patients (< 65 years, n = 12 802). On average, patients in the < or = 90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure target group have reached 85 mmHg, in the < or = 85 mmHg target group patients have reached 83 mmHg and in the < or = 80 mmHg target group patients have reached 81 mmHg. The percentage of those achieving target blood pressure in each target group at 24 months of follow-up is 85% in the < or = 90 mmHg target group, 75% in the < or = 85 mmHg target group and 57% in the < or = 80 mmHg target group. In the elderly subgroup (> or = 65 years of age), the percentage of patients achieving target at 24 months is higher for all target groups, namely 89% in the < or = 90 mmHg group, 80% in the 85 mmHg group and 62% in the 80 mmHg group. Antihypertensive treatment was initiated with a calcium antagonist, felodipine, at a dose of 5 mg once daily. If target blood pressure was not reached, additional antihypertensive therapy, with either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, was given. Further dose adjustments were made in accordance with a set protocol. As a fifth, and final, step, a diuretic could be added. There have been relatively few side effects in this large, multinational study of hypertensive patients. Only ankle oedema and coughing exceed a frequency of 0.5% (ankle oedema 1.3% in young and 1.7% in elderly; coughing 0.5% in young and elderly). After two years, 84% of all patients are still taking their baseline therapy, felodipine. The 24-month data presented here indicate that it should be possible to fulfil the primary aims of the HOT Study.",3,E

This action of V1 receptor blockade may be mediated through various mechanisms including changes in intracellular calcium fluxes. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that inhibition of calcium entry may attenuate the reduction in arterial pressure observed with V1 receptor blockade. Sixteen hypertensive patients, 8 whites and 8 blacks, were examined. Each had their antihypertensive therapy stopped for 1 week. Following three baseline blood pressure measurements, all patients were given an intravenous bolus injection of a V1 receptor antagonist. Blood pressure was monitored every 10 min for a period of 3 h. Subjects were then randomized to either 0.2 mg clonidine twice daily or 300 mg diltiazem CD daily for a period of 3 days and the previous experiments repeated. Patients were then crossed over to the other drug for an additional 3 days and the experiments repeated. There was a significant reduction from baseline in the mean arterial pressure among blacks but not whites (-11 +/- 3 delta mm Hg blacks versus -1 +/- 2 delta mm Hg whites, P < .01). In the presence of clonidine, there were similar reductions in arterial pressure in both groups (P = .026) with a further reduction following V1 receptor blockade only in the blacks (-7 +/- 3 delta mm Hg blacks versus 6 +/- 2 delta mm Hg whites; P < .001). Conversely, in the presence of diltiazem CD, there were no further reductions in arterial pressure in either group following the V1 receptor antagonist. We conclude that calcium channel blockade abolishes the blood pressure lowering response of V1 receptor blockade in blacks.",5,E

This study evaluated the renal effects, along with the efficacy, of isradipine in two subgroups of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (EH), defined according to plasma renin activity (PRA). Twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive 12-week treatment with slow-release isradipine (2.5-5 mg) or placebo. Assessment of PRA related to concurrent 24-hour sodium excretion was used to define patients with high/medium (n=16) and low renin profile (n=10). Urinary albumin excretion (UAE), serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR, as endogenous creatinine clearance) were measured. Blood pressure (BP) decrease with isradipine was greater in the low PRA group as compared with the high/medium PRA group (P<0.05), and normalization of BP was achieved in all low-renin patients compared with 57% in the high/medium PRA group. BP reduction in the placebo group was statistically not significant. Isradipine, but not placebo, induced significant reduction in UAE (P<0.05); the decrease was similar in both PRA groups. Treatment did not cause any significant changes in GFR, PRA, urinary sodium or creatinine excretion, or serum aldosterone or creatinine concentrations. The decrease of BP in the whole isradipine-treated group was inversely correlated with pretreatment serum creatinine as well as with basal urinary creatinine excretion. In conclusion, the antihypertensive effect of isradipine was more pronounced in low-renin EH patients, despite similar effects on renal function and UAE in both PRA groups.",5,E

One hundred and ninety-eight patients were randomized to active treatment; 14 patients discontinued the study because of side effects.; After a four-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to amlodipine 5 mg once-a-day or diltiazem slow release formulation (SR) 90 mg twice daily. Doses were increased to 10 mg and 180 mg to achieve sitting diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or less.; During 20 weeks on active treatment, compliance was assessed by pill counts and medication event monitoring system (MEMS), assessing percentage of prescribed doses taken, percentage days correct doses taken, percentage prescribed doses taken on time and blood pressure control as determined by office blood pressure measurement.; The percentage prescribed doses taken (by either pill count of MEMS) showed a high degree of compliance, similar for the two treatments. However, other parameters of compliance were significantly better with once versus twice daily therapy. Partial compliance (less than 80% by pill count) led to less blood pressure control with the short acting diltiazem, but did not affect blood pressure control for the long acting amlodipine. Side effects profiles did not differ between the two treatments.; Within the constraints of a clinical trial, hypertensive patients in primary care show a high degree of overall compliance with once or twice daily pill-taking, but patterns of pill-taking are more erratic with twice versus once daily medication, particularly in men. The results suggest that the negative consequences of partial compliance for blood pressure control can be offset by choosing agents with a duration of action well beyond the dosing interval.",5,E

The antihypertensive efficacy of a new 24 mg formulation was evaluated in 187 patients in 15 centres across the country. After a two-week placebo washout, mild to moderate hypertensive patients were randomized in a double-blind, parallel design to four weeks of placebo or nifedipine GITS 20 mg once daily treatment. Changes in office blood pressure (BP) were noted for each group. Ambulatory BP was also monitored at baseline and after four weeks of placebo/nifedipine therapy in a subgroup of 66 patients at five centres. After four weeks of treatment, office BP in the placebo group decreased by 5.0 +/- 11.9/5.4 +/- 7.9 mmHg compared with 9.3 +/- 11.2/8.6 +/- 7.4 mmHg in the nifedipine GITS group. Both systolic and diastolic BP were significantly decreased (P = 0.006 and P = 0.001 for systolic and diastolic, respectively) more with nifedipine GITS. Heart rate did not significantly differ between the groups at baseline nor after four weeks of treatment. The percentage of responders--defined as having a sitting diastolic BP less than 90 mmHg or a decrease from baseline of 10 mmHg--was 57% for nifedipine GITS versus 32% for placebo (P < 0.05). Daytime average diastolic blood pressure was 86.4 +/- 6.4 mmHg in the nifedipine GITS 20 mg group compared with 93.7 +/- 8.9 mmHg in the placebo group (P < 0.02). The maximum antihypertensive effect of nifedipine during ambulatory monitoring was similar to the reduction in BP observed in the office at the end of the dosing interval. The frequency of spontaneously reported adverse events was similar for nifedipine GITS (32.3%) and placebo (37.2%). These results indicate that 20 mg of nifedipine GITS is efficacious in decreasing BP, with good 24 h control and an incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo-treated patients.",5,E

Following a 2-week placebo run-in-period 13 patients were randomized to receive amlodipine (5 to 10 mg once daily) and 8 patients to receive nifedipine (20 or 40 mg twice daily) in an 8-week treatment phase. Antianginal efficacy was assessed with angina diares, investigators, and patients global evaluations and with treadmill exercise test during placebo run-in-period and after 8 weeks of the therapy. Amlodipine significantly reduced both weekly anginal attacks and consumption of glyceryl trinitrate tablets. This effect was more pronounced compared to efficacy of nifedipine. Exercise tolerance was also improved more markedly after amlodipine than after nifedipine treatment. Amlodipine treatment resulted in significant increase in total exercise time, increase the exercise time to angina onset, increase time to ST segment depression, decrease in ST segment depression, decrease in total duration of ST segment depression and decrease in duration of pain. In patients treated with nifedipine only favourable effect was significant decrease in total duration of ST segment depression, without significant changes of other examined parameters. Both drugs decreased blood pressure with no significant change in heart rate. No serious adverse events occurred in any patients during therapy with amlodipine as well as with nifedipine. The results of the study demonstrate that amlodipine has markedly better anti-anginal efficacy than nifedipine with respect to the most of the parameters examined. However both drugs showed comparable antihypertensive action and both were well tolerated by angina patients. The good anti-anginal and hypotensive efficacy and safety of amiodipine with once daily dosage regimen makes this drug an excellent choice of treatment for hypertensive patients with severe coronary artery disease.",7,E

The incidence of 'any discomfort' and 'swollen ankles' increased with amlodipine but not with losartan treatment. The opposite was found for 'dizziness upon standing'. The incidence of drug-related adverse events and the number of patients withdrawn from therapy were higher with amlodipine than they were with losartan treatment. The PGWB index at week 12 indicated that improvements from baseline had occurred in some domains for the losartan groups whereas it remained unchanged for the amlodipine group.; Both losartan and amlodipine were effective in lowering the blood pressure and were tolerated well. Administration of 50 mg losartan (plus 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide if necessary) and of 5 mg amlodipine (or 10 mg if necessary) lowered the blood pressure equally well or better than did 50 mg losartan (or 100 mg if necessary). Drug-related adverse effects and withdrawal from the study were more common for the amlodipine group. The clinical significance of the improvements in the PGWB index with losartan needs to be studied further.",5,E

A total of 1700 patients previously or newly diagnosed with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure, 95 to 114 mm Hg) were included. The 20-week treatment period was completed by 1326 patients. Patients received nifedipine GITS 30 mg initially; the dose could be titrated upward to 60 mg after 3 and 6 weeks. Of all patients entered, 605 (35.6%) reported one or more adverse events. The three most frequently occurring adverse events were headache (12.2%), peripheral edema (8.1%), and dizziness (2.9%). The frequency of adverse events was highest in the first 3 weeks and decreased subsequently. The overall incidence of adverse events was 29.8% in patients receiving 30 mg of nifedipine GITS and 25.3% in those receiving 60 mg; adverse events were the cause of study discontinuation in 12.3% of patients.

Three major variants of cerebrovascular drug effects were observed: absence of changes (variant I), decrease in carotid vascular resistance with increase in rCBF and elimination of side-to-side asymmetry (variant II), and increase in carotid vascular resistance with further reduction of rCBF ipsilaterally ICA stenosis, and increased side-to-side asymmetry (variant III). Frequency of variant III was significantly higher in patients with severe ICA stenosis. Enalapril produced variant I of cerebrovascular effects in most patients examined; variant III was observed only in 13% of patients with severe ICA stenosis. Isradipine produced variant I of cerebrovascular effects much less frequently than did enalapril. For this drug, variant II was most typical in patients without ICA stenosis and with moderate ICA stenosis. In 43.5% of patients with severe ICA stenosis, however, isradipine produced reduction of cerebral perfusion. Presumably the presence of ICA stenosis, especially >75%, increases the risk of cerebrovascular disorders in antihypertensive therapy. In patients with severe ICA stenosis, treatment with enalapril appears to be safer than that with isradipine.",5,E

Furthermore, to elucidate the mechanism responsible for regression of LV hypertrophy after treatment, LV mass index (LVMI) by echocardiography, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PAC), norepinephrine, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration were measured before and after treatment. Thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to the NIL, TEM, or CAD groups. Blood pressure (BP) before treatment was 174 +/- 10/104 +/- 7, 173 +/- 18/103 +/- 8, and 171 +/- 16/103 +/- 7 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) in NIL, TEM, and CAD groups, respectively. BP was lower after treatment with each of the three test drugs than after the placebo period, and there were no differences in BP reduction among three groups. LVMI, in NIL and TEM, was reduced from 129 +/- 48 to 115 +/- 39 g/m2 and from 117 +/- 39 to 88 +/- 20 g/m2 (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively), whereas, in the CAD group, it was increased (110 +/- 30 to 138 +/- 27 g/m2; p < 0.01). In the CAD group, PAC decreased and ANP increased significantly. The change in LVMI correlated with that in BP for TEM and with that in ANP in all patients. These data indicated that LV volume overload as well as LV pressure overload may contribute to LV hypertrophy and that monotherapy with CAD is not desirable from the point of view of LV mass reduction in essential hypertension.",6,E

Out of 809 patients with stable angina pectoris, lipid variables were obtained in 786 patients at baseline, and after one month's double-blind treatment with metoprolol or verapamil, to evaluate treatment effects on these lipid variables. During a median follow-up time of 3.3 years (2663 patient years), 37 patients suffered a CV death, 30 suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and 100 underwent a revascularization. Apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were predictors of CV death or non-fatal MI in univariate analyses, but only apo A-I remained as an independent predictor in multivariate analyses. All lipid variables except low density lipoprotein cholesterol were related to the risk of revascularization in univariate analyses, but only apo A-I and apo B were independent predictors of such events. Triglycerides were weakly, but not independently, associated with prognosis. Verapamil and metoprolol had differential short-term effects on lipids, with a shift towards a more atherogenic profile in metoprolol treated patients. However, there was no significant impact of the treatment given, or of these treatment effects on the risk of CV events. Results of the present study suggest that apolipoprotein levels were better predictors of CV events than other lipid parameters in patients with stable angina pectoris.",8,8

Patients were randomized to one of the two drugs and titrated at 2-week intervals to 5 or 10 mg of amlodipine or 180, 240, or 360 mg of long-acting diltiazem during a 10-week treatment period. Both drugs significantly reduced resting, sitting, standing, and 24-h ambulatory systolic and diastolic pressures. Amlodipine caused significantly greater reductions in sitting and standing systolic pressures, standing diastolic pressures, and 24-h ambulatory systolic and diastolic pressures versus diltiazem. Sitting systolic pressures were reduced from 151.9 +/- 2.0 (SE) at baseline to 137.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg with amlodipine treatment and from 149.0 +/- 2.1 to 145.1 +/- 2.5 mm Hg with diltiazem. Sitting diastolic pressures were reduced from 100.2 +/- 0.6 to 87.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg with amlodipine and from 101.1 +/- 1.0 to 91.9 +/- 1.1 mm Hg with diltiazem. Reductions in standing systolic pressures after treatment were -12.1 +/- 1.5 mm Hg amlodipine v -4.6 +/- 1.5 mm Hg diltiazem (P < .01), and reductions in standing diastolic pressures were -11.8 +/- 0.9 mm Hg amlodipine v -8.6 +/- 0.9 mm Hg diltiazem (P < .02). Heart rates did not change significantly with either drug during the study. Two subjects in each group dropped out because of adverse experiences. Although both agents were well tolerated and reduced blood pressures consistently over the 10-week test period, amlodipine was more effective than diltiazem in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures to the target pressures of < 140 mm Hg systolic and < 90 mm Hg diastolic over a range of doses widely used in clinical practice.",5,E

Nifedipine GITS controlled ambulatory blood pressure during the early morning surge and at night time as well. Nifedipine GITS increased plasma renin activity and noradrenaline by 50 and 20%, respectively, compared to the 150 and 0% change produced by enalapril. Both nifedipine GITS and enalapril reduced proteinuria by 37%. Patients had increasing levels or proteinuria proportional to higher ambient sodium intake (r = 0.48; p < 0.01). This effect was accentuated during nifedipine GITS therapy as compared to enalapril.; Nifedipine GITS was superior to enalapril in controlling ambulatory blood pressure, but they were equivalent in reducing proteinuria (37%). They had disparate effects on neural activation and the duration of action. Raised protein excretion appears to be associated with raised sodium intake.

We examined the effects of amlodipine on exercise capacity and central and regional hemodynamics in 32 patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure in a single-center, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial. All were taking at least 40 mg of furosemide daily with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Ischemic heart disease was the most common cause of heart failure, but no patient had symptom-limiting angina. Mean treadmill exercise capacity in patients taking amlodipine increased by 96 seconds (95% confidence interval -23 to 215) and 50 seconds (-34 to 135) in the placebo group; mean difference in change between treatments was 70 seconds (-90 to 233), p = 0.38. Active treatment with amlodipine did not affect self-paced corridor walking times. Similarly, there were no significant effects on cardiac output, oxygen uptake, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure at rest or during exercise. Calf and renal blood flow were also unchanged by treatment. The lack of significant effect demonstrated by these data suggests a limited role for amlodipine in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, although it may prove beneficial in those with nonischemic disease. More data are required before amlodipine can be recommended for all patients with chronic heart failure.",4,E

The study cohort for this database study consisted of 496 randomized patients who performed the AECG, ETT, and 12-lead electrocardiogram at rest at both the qualifying and week 12 visits. The effect of modifying ischemia by treatment on the incidence of cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, or hospitalization for an ischemic event) at 1 year was examined. In the 2 medical treatment groups (n = 328) there was an association between the number of ambulatory electrocardiographic ischemic episodes at the qualifying visit and combined cardiac events at 1 year (p = 0.003). In the AECG ischemia-guided patients there was a trend associating greater reduction in the number of ambulatory electrocardiographic ischemia episodes with a reduced incidence of combined cardiac events (r = -0.15, p = 0.06). In the revascularization strategy patients this association was absent. In the medical treatment patients the exercise duration on the baseline ETT was inversely associated with an adverse prognosis (p = 0.02). The medical treatment strategies only slightly improved the exercise time and the exercise duration remained of prognostic significance. In the revascularization group strategy patients this association was absent.

The target diastolic blood pressure of 80, 85 and 90 mmHg was determined at the randomisation. In order to reach the target blood pressure, a strategy of treatment was determined: the 1st step was felodipine (a long acting dihydropyridine) and the next steps (if the blood pressure reduction is not enough) propose the addition of different therapeutic classes and/or the increase of each drug doses. The available data after 2 years of the patients follow-up allow us to evaluate the incidence of the reported side effects according to the target blood pressure assigned by randomisation and the number of hypertension drugs used to reach these targets. The percentage of patients with at least one side effect at 12 and 24 months of follow-up are respectively: for the target group DBP < or = 90 mmHg: 9.2% versus 6%; for the target group DBP < or = 85 mmHg: 8% versus 4.4%; for the target group DBP < or = 80 mmHg: 7.9% versus 4.9%. The overall tolerability is not influenced by the target diastolic blood pressure but depends on the number of hypertension drugs used. At 24 months, 2.8% of patients are under monotherapy; 7% under bitherapy and 9.8% under tritherapy. The incidence of the side effects decreases after the 1st year, but slower than between the third months and the first year. There is an influence of the region on the incidence of the side effects, the south European countries describing more side effects than France or the north European countries. This seems to be linked with a perception of the side effects more than with a higher rate.

Eligible studies totalled 65 published and unpublished randomised controlled trials involving 9903 subjects and 10,675 treatment exposures: 4492 to isradipine, 1473 to isradipine sustained release, 2768 to other active drugs, and 1942 to placebo. Mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, other serious incident illnesses, such as cancer, and withdrawals were sought. Seventy-five per cent of the isradipine exposures were to standard-release formulations and 25% were to sustained-release formulations. Overall, isradipine therapy shows no difference in risk of major adverse events or withdrawals compared to other active controls or placebo (odds ratios [OR] 0.9; 95% CI 0.7-1.46 and 0.5; 95% CI 0.2-1.3). These major adverse events included angina, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and overall mortality. Isradipine sustained release could be compared only to placebo, based on available data, and shows a lower risk of withdrawals (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.9), and a similar trend was observed for major adverse events, (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.3-2.5). Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials were analysed in separate meta-analyses and later combined when this sensitivity analysis of risk showed no differences between the groups. In conclusion, we find no evidence for increased risk of serious adverse events in patients receiving isradipine as monotherapy for hypertension.",I,I

Daytime and night-time blood pressures were assessed according to two clock-time-dependent and two clock-time-independent methods, with a wide and a narrow approach for each technique.; Fifty-four patients completed the 6-month treatment period. Left ventricular mass, adjusted for sex and body size, was correlated significantly to systolic and diastolic clinic blood pressures, both before (r = 0.57 and r = 0.48, P < 0.001) and during antihypertensive therapy (r = 0.43, P < 0.001 and r = 0.27, P < 0.05). Changes in left ventricular mass were significantly related to changes in blood pressure. The correlation coefficients amounted to 0.39 (P < 0.01) and 0.40 (P < 0.01) for the conventional and automated measurements of clinic systolic blood pressures, respectively, and to 0.45 (P < 0.001) for the average 24 h systolic blood pressure; these r values were 0.27 (NS), 0.20 (NS) and 0.43 (P < 0.01), respectively, for the diastolic blood pressure.

Patients with regular narrow complex tachycardia were randomly assigned to undergo either the Valsalva maneuver or CSM. If the tachycardia was not terminated by the method chosen by randomization, then the alternative method of vagal maneuver was used. If the tachycardia was not converted by both methods of vagal stimulation, patients would undergo either synchronized electrical cardioversion or a pharmacologic method of conversion at the discretion of the treating physician, depending on the patient's hemodynamic status.; One hundred forty-eight instances of SVT were studied Sixty-two patients underwent Valsalva maneuver first with conversion in 12 (success rate of 19.4%). Eighty-six underwent CSM first with conversion in 9 (success rate 10.5%). Carotid sinus massage was used in the 50 cases of SVT in which conversion was not achieved with the Valsalva maneuver. Conversion occurred in 7 cases (success rate 14.0%). For the 77 cases of SVT in which initial CSM did not achieve conversion, conversion occurred in 13 with the Valsalva maneuver (success rate 16.9%). The Valsalva maneuver and CSM achieved conversion in a total of 41 instances of SVT (success rate 27.7%).; Vagal maneuvers are efficacious in terminating about one quarter of spontaneous SVT cases.

Malignant hypertension is a hypertensive urgency characterized by grade III/IV retinopathy and widespread endothelial damage. Control of BP is essential in the treatment of these disorders. The effects of hypertension on target organ function need to be balanced against the risks of excessive BP lowering. In hypertensive emergencies, BP should be lowered within minutes with parenteral agents to prevent critical end-organ damage. In hypertensive urgencies, BP can be lowered more slowly over several hours, often with oral agents, to avoid a detrimental fall in BP. The absolute indications for treatment and the optimal therapy depend on the underlying condition.",5,E

The present multicenter, double-masked, randomized, parallel-design trial was performed to assess the reproducibility of these results using a flexible-titration design. Following a 4-week, single-masked, placebo run-in period, 296 patients with a trough SDBP of between 95 and 114 mm Hg (21 to 27 hours postdose) were randomized to receive once-daily treatment with mibefradil 50 mg (n = 146) or amlodipine 5 mg (n = 150). In patients whose trough SDBP was greater than 90 mm Hg after 4 or 8 weeks of double-masked therapy, the dosage was titrated upward to mibefradil 100 mg or amlodipine 10 mg for the remainder of the 12-week active treatment period. A greater proportion of amlodipine-treated patients (65%) than of mibefradil-treated patients (54%) required titration to the higher dose. Despite this difference, statistically equivalent reductions in trough SDBP were observed after 12 weeks of treatment with 50 to 100 mg of mibefradil QD (-11.7 +/- 6.4 mm Hg) and 5 to 10 mg of amlodipine QD (-11.9 +/- 6.9 mm Hg). SDBP was normalized to < or = 90 mm Hg at week 12 in 66% of patients treated with mibefradil and 65% of those receiving amlodipine. The tolerability profile of mibefradil was superior to that of amlodipine, with significantly fewer patients (P = 0.009) reporting leg edema after mibefradil treatment (7%) than after amlodipine treatment (17%). The results of this study confirm those of the previous trial. Once-daily treatment with mibefradil 50 to 100 mg for 12 weeks was as effective as 12 weeks of once-daily treatment with amlodipine 5 to 10 mg in reducing SDBP and was associated with a significantly lower incidence of leg edema.",5,E

The effect of diltiazem on the pharmacokinetic disposition of cyclosporine after oral Neoral application is unknown and it is unclear whether or not the diltiazem-cyclosporine interaction is affected by the galenic cyclosporine formulation.; Fifty-one stable renal allograft patients (19 females, 32 males) were enrolled in this prospective, randomized and double-blind study. The patients were assigned to 3 treatment groups: with diltiazem (I, n = 17), with nifedipine (II, n = 17) and without calcium channel blockers (III, n = 17). Nine patients in each group received Sandimmun and 8 patients Neoral. Blood concentrations of cyclosporine and its metabolites AM1 and AM9 were measured using HPLC for 12 weeks.

Cyclosporine doses were adjusted on basis of the blood levels.; The cyclosporine doses required to achieve target blood levels were significantly lower in group I compared with group II (-43%) and group III (-33%; p < 0.0001). Although the cyclosporine blood concentrations in all groups were in the therapeutic range, the blood levels in group I showed a much lower variability. The blood concentrations of the metabolite AM1 in group I were significantly higher than those in groups II and III after dose correction (p < 0.0001), those of AM9 were significantly lower in group I than in groups II and III (p < 0.0001).

Both groups had similar pretreatment blood-pressure (BP) values. Blood pressure was recorded at 10-min intervals for 12 h by using an automated device. In the first 3 h of treatment, nifedipine capsules induced a faster and greater hypotensive effect than nifedipine retard, which was associated with an increase in heart rate. At 2 h after treatment, nifedipine capsules decreased BP to levels (159 +/- 5/105 +/- 3 mm Hg) that were significantly lower than those reached by nifedipine-retard (175 +/- 4/118 +/- 4 mm Hg; p < 0.05). Both preparations induced a similar maximal BP decrease of approximately 30% of the placebo values, but the peak decrease of BP occurred significantly later with nifedipine-retard (283 +/- 31 min after administration) than with nifedipine capsules (100 +/- 14 min; p < 0.01). Four hours after administration, the hypotensive effect of nifedipine capsules was blunted, and a second administration was necessary, whereas nifedipine-retard reduced BP slowly and continuously for < or =12 h and more smoothly. Flush and headache were more frequently found with nifedipine capsules. We conclude that in black patients with hypertensive crisis, nifedipine capsules produce an abrupt decrease in BP that may be potentially harmful. Thus for patients suitable for treatment with nifedipine, nifedipine-retard is preferable because it effectively reduces BP for > or =12 h while achieving a rapid enough effect without critical short-term decreases in BP.",5,E

Comparisons of the methodology and results of these studies with other studies where an association between calcium antagonist therapy and cancer has not been apparent suggests that the association is most likely to be due to selection bias or chance. Clinical and biochemical studies have not produced a consistent plausible mechanism for a causative link between calcium antagonists and the development of cancer.

We identified 43 subjects from general practice with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension to compare the effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine with that of the beta-blocker atenolol on platelet function, plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels, fibrinolysis, and serum lipids in a randomised double-blind parallel group study. After careful evaluation to exclude concomitant aspirin use, only 24 subjects were eligible to enter the study. While isradipine and atenolol produced comparable and clinically significant falls in blood pressure (167 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 to 153 +/- 3/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, and 165 +/- 2/101 +/- 1 to 156 +/- 4/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively), neither drug produced a detectable effect on ex vivo platelet aggregation, platelet retention, or thromboxane generation with adrenaline, collagen, adenosine-di-phosphate, or platelet activating factor. However a decrease in plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels was observed which reached statistical significance (P < 0.05) after 12 weeks treatment in the isradipine but not the atenolol group. A 39% reduction with isradipine compared with 34% following atenolol treatment. Euglobulin clot lysis time was not altered by either drug. Serum cholesterol concentrations were also unaltered by drug treatment. Therapeutic doses of the calcium antagonist isradipine may produce a minor indirect effect on platelet function after several weeks of treatment. However, this is of doubtful clinical importance and may simply reflect an effect of lowered blood pressure on platelet function.",2,E

Nisoldipine CC was shown to demonstrate antihypertensive efficacy similar to HCTZ in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension.",5,E

Their advantage is good efficacy, relatively few and not dangerous side effects and first of all lack of bad metabolic effects (hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipoproteinemia). In contrast to beta-blockers and diuretics, which decline mortality from myocardial infarctions and strokes there are not similar information concerning calcium antagonists. Two meta-analysis from 1995 unexpectedly suggest, that some preparations of calcium antagonists increase mortality from myocardial infarctions and strokes. In our paper we discuss possible pathogenetic (harmful) mechanisms, pay attention to each class of calcium antagonists and time of action of the particular drugs. Short acting nifedipine formulation should be withdrawn from chronic hypertension and angina pectoris therapy. Ongoing multicenter trials in several European countries and in USA will decide the usefulness of other calcium antagonists preparations.",1,E

The trial design was a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, 12 week treatment phase, followed by a 36 week, open label phase. A total of 891 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) between 95 and 115 mm Hg were randomly assigned to enalapril 5 mg, diltiazem ER 120 mg, diltiazem ER 180 mg, enalapril 5 mg/diltiazem ER 120 mg (E5/D120), enalapril 5 mg/ diltiazem ER 180 mg (E5/D180), or placebo. In the open label phase, 562 patients received the fixed combination, titrated as needed to control SiDBP < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy was determined with trough (24 +/- 2 h postdose) sitting blood pressure measurements at week 12 and at the end of the open label part of the study. Safety was evaluated based on patient symptoms, clinical laboratories, and electrocardiograms (ECG). E5/D120 and E5/D180 significantly reduced trough SiDBP (-7.6 and -8.3 mm Hg, respectively; P < .05) versus their monotherapies. E5/D120 and E5/D180 significantly reduced trough sitting systolic blood pressure (-7.9 and -9.0, respectively; P < .05) versus both diltiazem ER monotherapies. All active treatments significantly decreased SiDBP and SiSBP versus placebo. E/D effectively lowered SiDBP and SiSBP during the open label extension. No significant difference was seen among treatment groups for the overall incidence of adverse events. The most common drug related adverse events were headache, edema/swelling, dizziness, asthenia/fatigue, cough, rash, and impotence. The event frequency for the combinations were similar to those seen with the monotherapies. Fixed combinations of E/D were generally well tolerated, with an increased blood pressure lowering effect as compared with the individual components in patients with stage I to III hypertension.",5,E

Dahl S/Jr inbred rats were assigned to daily exercise (EX) or sedentary (SED) treatment conditions (n = 12/group) at 4 weeks of age. Rats in the EX group were housed in cages with attached running wheels. After 5 weeks of exercise, rats were running 10.3 +/- 1.7 km/day. After at least 5 wks of treatment, all rats in both groups were placed on a 4.0% NaCl diet for 2 weeks to produce sodium-induced hypertension. Rats continued to either exercise daily or remain sedentary for an additional 2 weeks while consuming the high sodium diet. Carotid and jugular catheters were then implanted for measurements in conscious, resting, unrestrained rats on two separate days. Daily wheel running exercise for 7 to 9 weeks did not alter BP or HR in Dahl S/Jr rats consuming a 4.0% NaCl diet. However, acute arterial depressor responses to ganglionic blockade were less in EX rats. Furthermore, greater alpha-adrenergic (phenylephrine-induced) pressor responses were observed in the EX group while under ganglionic blockade. The findings suggest that overall resting sympathetic neural activity or cardiac beta-adrenergic responsiveness to sympathetic activity is reduced in this model of hypertension by daily wheel running exercise.",3,E

Three classes have only a single clinically approved compound: verapamil, diltiazem, and mibefradil. The fourth class, dihydropyridines, contains numerous compounds. All agents are effective in lowering blood pressure in short-term studies, and side effects that trouble the patient are infrequent. Long-term studies in hypertensive patients are limited. Short-acting agents such as nifedipine have been associated with an increased cardiovascular risk in some, but not all studies. These agents also probably create a compliance problem for hypertensive patients because of the need for multiple daily doses and their unpleasant side effects, e.g., ankle edema, palpitations, and flushing. Therefore, they are not useful or indicated for the treatment of hypertensive patients. No data have suggested that long-acting dihydropyridines or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers share the same fate. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest the opposite: they have a cardioprotective effect. However, definitive information will require the completion of several long-term trials, including ALLHAT, CONVINCE, HOT, INSIGHT and NORDIL. Finally, it is important to reflect on the lessons learned from the controversy associated with the potential risks of calcium channel blockers. First, disagreements are common when one uses case-controlled studies and are reflective of the poor precision of the methods used. What is statistically relevant in one study may not hold true for another and may have no clinical relevance, particularly if the relative risk is less than 2. Investigators need to temper their enthusiasm to reflect this reality. Second, at the cutting edge of science there is probably relatively little agreement about what is correct among equally competent scientists. All have bias in their positions and should both recognize and admit so to themselves and their colleagues. Inferring that those who disagree have an unstated secondary agenda that will bring personal financial rewards or government accolades is inappropriate and counterproductive. Third, the randomized clinical trial, despite all its imperfections, is still the best tool to establish common ground on controversial issues. Finally, what may seem best from the public health perspective may not be in the best interest of the individual patient--a possibility that physicians have to constantly consider. For example, no public health benefit occurs if patients remain hypertensive because they fail to take their medications, no matter what the medication.",I,5

According to the results of the two exercise tolerance tests (ETTs) performed during the placebo run-in, patients were divided into a fixed threshold group if the variability in time to 1 mm ST-segment depression was 20%, or a variable threshold group if it was higher. Efficacy was assessed by comparing the time to 1 mm ST-depression on a bicycle ETT after 4 weeks of treatment, adjusting for the baseline value. The adjusted means were 7.44 min for nifedipine GITS and 7.68 min for diltiazem; the difference was -0.24 min, with a lower 90% confidence limit of -0.90, which is within the stated interval for equivalence. The same result was confirmed by the 'intention-to-treat' analysis, and comparable results were obtained both in fixed and in variable threshold groups.

However, normotensive IDDM patients with MA show no change in GFR over a follow-up period of 10 years. Thus, in the present study, we used the cumulative incidence of progression to albuminuria (albumin excretion rate [AER] > 200 micrograms/min) from MA as the primary endpoint and the yearly increase in AER at a rate of 50% above baseline as the secondary end-point of renal function.; Ninety-two normotensive IDDM patients underwent double-blind, double-dummy treatment with either lisinopril or slow-release nifedipine in comparison with placebo. Ten patients discontinued the study during the 3-year follow-up period.; During the 3-year follow-up period, 7 of 34 placebo-treated (20.6%), 2 of 32 lisinopril-treated (6.3%), and 2 of 26 nifedipine-treated (7.7%) patients progressed to clinical albuminuria (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.03). Time-to-event analysis indicated a reduction in the risk of progression to macroalbuminuria of 58.1% (95% CI 27.8-68.4%) in the 32 patients on lisinopril (P < 0.02) and of 62.5% (95% CI 32.5-73.4%) in the 26 patients on nifedipine (P < 0.02) after adjustment for mean blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and baseline AER in comparison with the 34 patients on placebo. Baseline AER was 71 micrograms/min (range: 20.7-187.3) in progressors and 73 micrograms/min (range: 20.2-174.1) in nonprogressors (NS). The percentage of patients who showed a > 50% yearly increase of AER above baseline values was significantly lower in the lisinopril group (13 of 32, 40.6%, P < 0.02), but not in the nifedipine group (15 of 26, 57.7%), than in the placebo group (23 of 34, 67.6%). The lisinopril group had significantly lower blood pressure values during follow-up than either the nifedipine (P < 0.05) or the placebo (P < 0.01) group.; Our data show that both lisinopril and nifedipine are effective in delaying the occurrence of macroalbuminuria in normotensive IDDM patients with MA. As overt proteinuria strongly predicts end-stage renal failure, both treatments appear capable of preventing such a complication in normotensive IDDM patients with MA. However, lisinopril appears more powerful in slowing the course of nephropathy.",5,E

Group 4 received the same drugs as Group 3, in the reverse order. Pain and mood numeric rating scores, sedation scores, Prince Henry scores, patient-controlled cumulative postoperative analgesic consumption, and the incidence of side effects were assessed 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the operation in each group.

There were no differences in the pain, mood, and sedation scores and the incidence of side effects among the four groups. We conclude that epidural verapamil decreases postoperative pain, possibly by interfering with normal sensory processing and by preventing the establishment of central sensitization.; Calcium plays an important role in pain physiology at the spinal cord level. We examined the effect of bupivacaine plus verapamil (calcium channel blocker) and of bupivacaine alone. We demonstrated that the combination, administered epidurally, resulted in less postoperative analgesic consumption than bupivacaine alone.",4,E

This double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, multicenter, outpatient study evaluated the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of a calcium antagonist (verapamil SR) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril) in patients with mild-to-moderate (stages I and II) essential hypertension. Six hundred thirty-one patients were enrolled in this 10-week study. After a 4-week single-blind placebo phase, patients received one of the following daily dosage regimens in a double-blind fashion for 6 weeks: placebo, 4 mg of trandolapril, 240 mg of verapamil SR, or a combination of 4 mg of trandolapril and 240 mg of verapamil SR. Trough sitting diastolic blood pressure was lowered by 4.5 mm Hg, 4.3 mm Hg, and 8.1 mm Hg more than placebo in the trandolapril, verapamil SR, and combination groups, respectively. In the combination group, sitting diastolic blood pressure was significantly lowered (P < .01) by 3.6 mm Hg more than in the trandolapril group and by 3.8 mm Hg more than in the verapamil SR group. An analysis of the trough-to-peak ratio for sitting diastolic blood pressure revealed values of 0.75 and 0.67, for the 4-mg trandolapril and the combination groups, respectively, at end point. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was similar for all treatment groups. In this study the combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium antagonist was well tolerated and more effective than either agent administered alone for the treatment of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.",2,E

The study was conducted in a general practice setting using a randomized double-blind crossover design with Latin square allocation of treatment order within subjects. During each phase, doses were titrated to achieve a predose clinic sitting diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg. Three patients withdrew while taking amlodipine and 3 while taking placebo. The numbers of patients receiving the higher dose in each phase were as follows: placebo 22, diltiazem 12 and amlodipine 19. End-of-phase mean clinic sitting blood pressures were as follows: placebo 152/100, diltiazem 146/95 and amlodipine 140/93. End-of-phase mean 24-h ambulatory blood pressures were as follows: placebo 151/93, diltiazem 143/86 and amlodipine 137/84. Both clinic and ambulatory blood pressures were therefore significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in both active phases compared with placebo, and systolic blood pressure was also significantly lower with amlodipine compared with diltiazem. Heart rate was increased with amlodipine. Both drugs were well tolerated, and adverse events were predictable for each agent, with amlodipine causing more vasodilator side effects. Thus both amlodipine and diltiazem once-daily are effective in reducing blood pressure. While amlodipine is more potent than diltiazem in reducing systolic blood pressure, it causes more vasodilator side effects.",5,E

Available studies have provided strong evidence for a potential detrimental effect of the first-generation calcium antagonists in patients with CHF, indicating the need for great caution when these drugs are used in patients with significant depression of left ventricular systolic function. A number of second-generation CCB have demonstrated a strong vasodilatory effect and favorable hemodynamic action but failed to show a similar improvement in exercise capacity, morbidity and mortality. Moreover, drugs such as nicardipine and nisoldipine have resulted in a detrimental effect in some patients and, therefore, cannot be considered safe when used in patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure. Available information from the V-HeFT III study demonstrate a lack of an unfavorable effect of felodipine on exercise tolerance in patients with chronic heart failure. Although mortality rate was similar in both the felodipine and the placebo group, because of the relatively small number of patients in this study, no clear conclusion can be drawn regarding the effect of felodipine on mortality in patients with CHF. An encouraging signal regarding a potential role of CCB in the treatment of chronic heart failure has been provided by the recently completed PRAISE study. This prospective large-scale study demonstrated the safety of amlodipine, a long-acting dihydropyridine derivative, when used in patients with heart failure due to coronary artery disease. Furthermore, this study demonstrated a substantial reduction in mortality in patients with CHF due to nonischemic cardiomyopathy and provided a strong indication for a potential therapeutic benefit of amlodipine when added to standard CHF therapy in this patient population. No clear explanation is available at the present time regarding the reason for the deleterious effect demonstrated with some of the dihydropyridines and the contrasting benefit seen with amlodipine. Finally, more information regarding the safety and efficacy of dihydropyridines should become available in the next year. The PRAISE II study is ongoing and will provide further information regarding the therapeutic role of amlodipine in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. The MACH-1 study is evaluating the effect of mibefradil, a predominant T-type channel blocker with an ideal activity profile, on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic CHF.",5,E

Prospectively defined cardiovascular events were assessed as secondary outcomes.; Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of NIDDM and hypertension (systolic blood pressure of > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mmHg). Exclusion criteria included a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl, albuminuria > 40 micrograms/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin, or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics.

Patients were randomly divided into groups for a single blind trial, followed by observation for an average of 7.4 months. After treatment, the heart function of 84% of patients in the diltiazem group recovered to grade I or II, but this occurred for 64% of patients in the placebo group. Heart-thorax ratio was decreased from 0.59+/-0.07 to 0.56+/-0.07 and the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDd) from 65.40+/-8.60 mm to 61.12+/-9.86 mm, the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was increased from 35.75+/-10.78% to 42.52%+/-11.41% (P<0.01) in the diltiazem group (n=114). The above parameters were not significantly changed in the placebo group (n=107). Mortality was 3.5% in the diltiazem group and 11.2% in the placebo group (P<0.05). Further analysis also shows that LVEDd were reduced and EF were obviously elevated in patients with DCM of LVEDd <70 mm, but the above parameters weren't improved in patients of LVEDd >70 mm. The study suggests that diltiazem is safe and effective in the treatment of DCM, the action mechanism might be intervention in antibody-mediated myocardial damage and protection of myocardium.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether intravenous diltiazem is more effective than digoxin for ventricular rate control in AF after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A secondary end point was to determine whether ventricular rate control with diltiazem reduces postoperative LOHS compared with digoxin.; Patients with AF and ventricular rate > 100 beats/min within 7 days after coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomly assigned to receive intravenous therapy with diltiazem (n = 20) or digoxin (n = 20). Efficacy was measured with ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter monitoring). Safety was assessed by clinical monitoring and electrocardiographic recording. LOHS was measured from the day of surgery. Data were analyzed with the intention-to-treat principle in all randomly assigned patients. In addition, a separate intention-to-treat analysis was performed excluding patients who spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm. In the analysis of all randomly assigned patients, those who received diltiazem achieved ventricular rate control (> or = 20% decrease in pretreatment ventricular rate) in a mean of 10 +/- 20 (median 2) minutes compared with 352 +/- 312 (median 228) minutes for patients who received digoxin (p < 0.0001). At 2 hours, the proportion of patients who achieved rate control was significantly higher in patients treated with diltiazem (75% vs 35%, p = 0.03).

Fewer patients had high nocturnal SBP with amlodipine (39.3%) than nifedipine SR (71.4%; P = .042). Adverse events and treatment withdrawals occurred less frequently in amlodipine-treated patients than in nifedipine SR-treated patients. Amlodipine (5 to 10 mg) once daily provides improved compliance, better 24-h BP control, and fewer adverse events than 20 mg nifedipine SR twice daily in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.",5,E

Clinic BP was measured at every patient's visit, and 24 h ambulatory BP was monitored at baseline and at the end of each dose-titration period.; Single centre: hypertension research unit in Quebec City, Quebec.; There were 89 patients enrolled into the study. Eighty-four eligible patients were randomized, and 83 completed the study and were included in the final efficacy analysis.; Following a two-to four-week washout period (baseline), patients were randomly allocated to receive felodipine ER 5 mg, amlodipine 5 mg or nifedipine GITS 30 mg for four weeks (low dose). All study patients had their daily dose doubled to felodipine ER 10 mg, amlodipine 10 mg or nifedipine GITS 60 mg for a further four weeks (high dose).; Significant (P < 0.001) and similar changes from baseline in clinic BP were observed in all treatment groups for low and high doses. Ambulatory BP profiles showed comparable blood pressure reductions with felodipine ER and amlodipine, and a trend towards a lesser reduction with nifedipine GITS during 24 h, daytime and night-time periods. BP loads were similarly reduced with the three treatments. Trough to peak ratios (T:Ps) were calculated from 24 h ambulatory BP curves according to two different approaches: for diastolic and systolic BP, respectively, the global approach produced T:Ps of 0.49 and 0.50 with felodipine ER 5 mg; 0.50 and 0.34 with felodipine ER 10 mg; 0.70 and 0.60 with amlodipine 5 mg; 0.88 and 0.82 with amlodipine 10 mg; 0.65 and 0.55 with nifedipine GITS 30 mg; 0.68 and 0.53 with nifedipine GITS 60 mg.

Treatment based on ambulatory BP may be preferable to treatment guided by T:Ps because ambulatory BP is firmly established as a predictor of cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, there is no consensus on how to calculate T:Ps, and different methods of calculation may give divergent results.",5,E

Inadequate reduction of their blood pressure is a likely cause, but the optimum target blood pressure is not known. The impact of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has never been investigated in patients with hypertension. We aimed to assess the optimum target diastolic blood pressure and the potential benefit of a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid in the treatment of hypertension.; 18790 patients, from 26 countries, aged 50-80 years (mean 61.5 years) with hypertension and diastolic blood pressure between 100 mm Hg and 115 mm Hg (mean 105 mm Hg) were randomly assigned a target diastolic blood pressure. 6264 patients were allocated to the target pressure < or =90 mm Hg, 6264 to < or =85 mm Hg, and 6262 to < or =80 mm Hg. Felodipine was given as baseline therapy with the addition of other agents, according to a five-step regimen. In addition, 9399 patients were randomly assigned 75 mg/day acetylsalicylic acid (Bamycor, Astra) and 9391 patients were assigned placebo.; Diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 20.3 mm Hg, 22.3 mm Hg, and 24.3 mm Hg, in the < or =90 mm Hg, < or =85 mm Hg, and < or =80 mm Hg target groups, respectively. The lowest incidence of major cardiovascular events occurred at a mean achieved diastolic blood pressure of 82.6 mm Hg; the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality occurred at 86.5 mm Hg. Further reduction below these blood pressures was safe. In patients with diabetes mellitus there was a 51% reduction in major cardiovascular events in target group < or =80 mm Hg compared with target group < or =90 mm Hg (p for trend=0.005). Acetylsalicylic acid reduced major cardiovascular events by 15% (p=0.03) and all myocardial infarction by 36% (p=0.002), with no effect on stroke. There were seven fatal bleeds in the acetylsalicylic acid group and eight in the placebo group, and 129 versus 70 non-fatal major bleeds in the two groups, respectively (p<0.001).; Intensive lowering of blood pressure in patients with hypertension was associated with a low rate of cardiovascular events. The HOT Study shows the benefits of lowering the diastolic blood pressure down to 82.6 mm Hg. Acetylsalicylic acid significantly reduced major cardiovascular events with the greatest benefit seen in all myocardial infarction. There was no effect on the incidence of stroke or fatal bleeds, but non-fatal major bleeds were twice as common.",6,E

Due to intravesical administration of oxybutynin (CAS 5633-20-5) (n = 21) and trospium chloride (CAS 10405-02-4) (n = 21), respectively, a significant increase in maximum bladder capacity and decrease of detrusor pressure accompanied by an increase of residual urine were found in comparison to placebo in urodynamical investigations. Improvement of uninhibited bladder contractions occurred leading to higher filling volume. Under verapamil (CAS 152-11-4) (n = 21) no marked changes in the efficacy variables were found compared with placebo. All patients completed the study and were assessed with regard to efficacy and safety. No adverse events or marked changes in the vital signs were reported. The immediate onset of effect and the lack of adverse drug reactions suggest that treatment with topical oxybutynin or trospium chloride is an effective alternative in patients with intolerable side effects when orally treated. In addition, intravesical administration may be indicated in patients with bladder spasms due to indwelling catheter or in order to increase bladder capacity before percutaneous cystostomy.",1,E

It is a 1-year prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, comparative study. Patients between 25 and 75 years of age with untreated hypertension with elevated diastolic blood pressure (> or = 95 mmHg) on three occasions (twice on the first visit and once only on the second and third visits) were recruited from a population survey. After 4 weeks placebo run-in 71 patients were randomized to dosages of amlodipine 5-10 mg or lisinopril 10-20 mg, which were titrated on the basis of the effects on blood pressure. Fifty-nine patients completed the study period. Primary endpoints were left ventricular mass index and early to atrial peak filling velocity. Office and ambulatory blood pressure and other echocardiographic measurements were considered secondary. Decrease in blood pressure was equal for both treatment regimens. A statistically significant decrease in left ventricular mass index in both treatment groups was observed: -11.0 g/m2 (95% CI: -6.0, -16.1) in the amlodipine group and -12.6 g/m2 (95% CI: -8.2, -17.0) in the lisinopril group. The higher the baseline value of left ventricular mass before treatment, the more the decrease after treatment. Early to atrial peak filling velocity did not change significantly within the treatment groups: +0.07 (95% CI: -0.01, +0.15) in the amlodipine group and +0.01 (95% CI: -0.06, +0.08) in the lisinopril group. However, analysis of time measurements of the early peak showed significant changes for both treatment groups. No significant differences in primary and secondary endpoints between treatment groups were found. Twelve patients did not complete the study, seven in amlodipine and five in lisinopril, basically due to adverse events. The effects of amlodipine and lisinopril on left ventricular mass and early to atrial filling peak velocity after 1 year of treatment in patients with previously untreated mild to moderate hypertension are similar. Further studies are recommended, particularly with a larger sample size and a follow-up of longer duration.",5,E

The elimination half-life of amlodipine is longer than that of felodipine. To study whether the different elimination rates of the drugs were reflected in different duration of blood pressure (BP) control, we compared amlodipine and felodipine extended release (ER) by both conventional clinic BP 24 h after drug intake and 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), with special reference to nighttime and morning blood pressure. Two hundred and sixteen patients with primary hypertension (supine diastolic BP, 95 to 115 mm Hg) were randomized to receive amlodipine or felodipine ER in a multicenter study. The starting dose of both drugs was 5 mg. If the target clinic diastolic BP (90 mm Hg) had not been achieved after 4 weeks the dose was increased to 10 mg. Twenty-four-hour ABPM was performed with the subjects taking placebo medication before randomization and after 4 and 8 weeks undergoing active treatment. Significantly more patients responded after 4 weeks of treatment with amlodipine (50%) as compared with felodipine (33%) (P = .013). ABPM during daytime (07:00 to 23:00) was similar during both treatments, but nighttime systolic (P = .026) and diastolic (P = .019) BP was more effectively reduced by amlodipine than by felodipine. After 8 weeks 82% achieved the target pressure with amlodipine and 69% with felodipine (P = .036 for the difference). Amlodipine seems to be more effective than felodipine when the drugs are compared in the same dose, with regard to the effect on clinic BP 24 h after dosing and to ambulatory BP during the night. The longer elimination half-life of amlodipine as compared to felodipine is the probable reason for this finding.",5,E

Following an initial 4-week placebo period, patients whose sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) was between 95 and 114 mm Hg, and whose sitting systolic blood pressure was between 150 and 219 mm Hg, were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either barnidipine (10 mg) or nitrendipine (10 mg) once daily, for a 6-week double-blind period. Subsequently, patients with an SiDBP of less than 90 mm Hg continued for a second 6-week period with the same monotherapy, while patients with an SiDBP of 90 mm Hg or above received double the dose of antihypertensive treatment for the next 6 weeks.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether antihypertensive drug therapy improves impaired endothelium-dependent renal vasorelaxation in essential hypertensive patients without atherosclerosis. We evaluated the effects of intravenous infusion of L-arginine (500 mg/kg given over 30 minutes) on systemic and renal hemodynamics in 27 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor imidapril or the calcium antagonist amlodipine for 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion. After the 12 weeks, the decrease in blood pressure was similar in the imidapril (n=14) and amlodipine (n=13) groups. The increase in renal plasma flow was also similar in both groups. L-Arginine-induced renovascular relaxation was increased by imidapril (renal plasma flow, 9.6+/-5.1% to 14.4+/-7.4%; renal vascular resistance, -10.4+/-8.1% to -16.7+/-9.2%, P<0.05, respectively) but not by amlodipine. Urinary excretion of nitrite/nitrate in response to L-arginine was significantly increased by imidapril (90+/-29% to 134+/-63%, P<0.05) but remained unchanged by amlodipine. These findings suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improves the impaired endothelium-dependent renovascular relaxation in patients with essential hypertension due to the increase in nitric oxide production and that the reduction in blood pressure with a calcium antagonist does not play a major role in the potentiation of L-arginine/nitric oxide-mediated effects.",5,E

Although literature on reduction of LV mass with antihypertensive therapy is extensive, little information is available on effects of treatment on left atrial size.; Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomly allocated to treatment with atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, hydrochlorothiazide, or prazosin in a double-masked trial. Two-dimensional targeted M-mode echocardiography was used to assess left atrial size and LV mass at baseline, 8 weeks, and 1 and 2 years. Longitudinal analysis examined changes in left atrial size from the baseline study, statistically adjusting for age, race, pretreatment left atrial size and LV mass, and serial measurements of systolic blood pressure, body weight, urinary sodium excretion, and physical activity score. Without adjustment for covariates, only hydrochlorothiazide was associated with decreases in left atrial size from baseline at 8 weeks (-1.0 +/- 5.2 mm; P=0.052), 1 year (-2.0 +/- 5.1 mm; P=0.02), and 2 years (4.6+/-7.2 mm; P=0.002). After adjustment for effects of covariates, patients with normal left atrial size had greater reduction (-3.3 mm) in left atrial size at 2 years with hydrochlorothiazide than with any other drug. For patients with left atrial enlargement, left atrial size decreased significantly with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, clonidine, and diltiazem at 1 year and with all treatments at 2 years. However, reduction at 2 years was greater with hydrochlorothiazide than with captopril or prazosin.; Antihypertensive drugs differ in their effects on left atrial size. Hydrochlorothiazide was associated with greater overall reduction of left atrial size than other drugs effective for the treatment of hypertension. Reduction of left atrial size with therapy is in part independent of factors known to influence left atrial size, including LV mass and reduction of LV mass with treatment. The clinical benefit of reducing left atrial size with antihypertensive treatment remains to be determined.",5,E

CONVINCE will compare the incidence of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular-disease-related death in two antihypertensive treatment regimens. One treatment arm begins with controlled onset-extended release (COER)-verapamil, which has its major antihypertensive effect 6-12 hours after administration. The other arm (standard of care (SOC)) begins with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or atenolol, one of which is preselected by the investigator for an individual patient prior to randomization. Secondary objectives include comparisons of the regimens for each of the components of the primary endpoint (separately), death or hospitalization related to cardiovascular disease, efficacy in lowering blood pressure to goal, primary events occurring between 6 am and noon, all-cause mortality, withdrawals from blinded therapy, cancer, and hospitalizations due to bleeding. Patients may be enrolled if they are hypertensive and at least 55 years of age and have an established second risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Initial medications include COER-verapamil (180 mg/d), HCTZ (12.5 mg/d), or atenolol (50 mg/d). Initial doses are doubled if blood pressure (BP) does not reach goal (systolic BP < 140 mm and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If BP is not controlled by the higher dose of the initial medication, HCTZ is added to COER-verapamil, or the SOC choice not initially selected is added in the SOC arm. An ACE-inhibitor is recommended (although nearly any open-label medication is allowed) as the third step for patients whose BP is not adequately controlled or who have a contraindication to one of the two SOC medications. Patients take two sets of tablets daily, one in the morning and one in the evening. Although most patients switch from an established antihypertensive medication to randomized treatment, untreated patients with stages I-III hypertension (SBP between 140 and 190 or DBP between 90 and 110 mm Hg) are eligible.

Eighteen males were studied. Each patient received isosorbide dinitrate and nifedipine continuously for 5 weeks by randomised cross-over technique. Exercise treadmill tests were performed before each treatment period, at the beginning of treatment, 4 weeks after initiation of treatment and on the first and eighth days of drug withdrawal. At the end of treatment the antianginal effect of both agents attenuated (versus acute administration). Abrupt cessation of isosorbide dinitrate caused only a tendency towards decrease in exercise tolerance versus pre-treatment level. Alternatively, abrupt cessation of nifedipine resulted in substantial deterioration in exercise tolerance, which was statistically significant 21 and 24 h after the last dose administration. The number of anginal attacks increased >25% in two patients after cessation of isosorbide dinitrate and in eight patients after cessation of nifedipine. In no patient rest angina episodes appeared after stopping of isosorbide dinitrate, however, after stopping of nifedipine rest angina episodes appeared in three patients. We conclude that withdrawal phenomenon of nifedipine is much more pronounced than that of isosorbide dinitrate and may emerge on the first day of drug cessation. Such a phenomenon may be evident even in patients in whom nifedipine effect have attenuated due to the development of tolerance.",I,E

Cilnidipine is a novel and unique 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that has the L-type and N-type voltage-dependent calcium channel-blocking action. Fourteen hypertensive outpatients (four men and 10 women; aged 64 +/- 2 years, mean +/- SEM) were enrolled in this study. Their ambulatory BP and electrocardiogram were monitored for 24 h at intervals of 30 min with a portable recorder after a 4-week drug-free period, after a 4-week treatment period with cilnidipine (5 or 10 mg once daily), and after a 4-week treatment period with nifedipine retard (10 or 20 mg twice daily). The order of the three periods was randomized. Autonomic nerve activity was evaluated by a power spectral analysis of HR variability, by using the high-frequency (HF) component as an index of parasympathetic nerve activity and the ratio of the low-frequency (LF) component to the HF component (LF/HF) as an index of sympathovagal balance. Cilnidipine and nifedipine retard significantly reduced the 24-h BP of these patients to similar extents (cilnidipine, -11 +/- 3/-6 +/- 1 mm Hg; nifedipine retard, -15 +/- 3/-6 +/- 2 mm Hg). Cilnidipine did not change the 24-h average HR, whereas nifedipine retard significantly increased it (+3.3 +/- 1.4 beats/min; p < 0.05). Nifedipine retard significantly increased the LF/HF ratio in the daytime and the nighttime. Such changes were limited to the daytime in the treatment period with cilnidipine. These results suggest that cilnidipine is effective as a once-daily antihypertensive agent and had less influence on autonomic nervous system and HR than did nifedipine retard.",I,E

Five patients were randomly assigned to the gingivectomy group and 5 patients to the periodontal flap group. Only anterior segments of the oral cavity (canine to canine) were surgically treated. Clinical measurements, including probing depths, plaque index, and gingival sulcus index, were taken at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year.

Exercise time (P=1), maximum ST depression (P=0.48), and sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography scores (P=0.17) were unchanged between treatments. Stunning occurred more often with ISMN than amlodipine (82% versus 48%).

However, significant side-effects have been reported during acute testing with CCB. Therefore, to identify accurately patients who may benefit from long-term CCB therapy, there is a need for a safe, potent and short-acting vasodilator. The aim of this study was to compare the acute response to inhaled nitric oxide (NO) and oral high doses of CCB in 33 consecutive patients with PPH. A significant acute vasodilator response was defined by a fall in both mean pulmonary artery pressure and total pulmonary resistance by >20%. Ten patients responded acutely to NO, nine of whom responded acutely to CCB, without any complications. The 23 other patients failed to respond to NO and CCB. In these nonresponders, nine serious adverse events were observed with CCB (38%). There was no clinical or baseline haemodynamic feature predicting acute vasodilator response. Long-term oral treatment with CCB was restricted to the nine acute responders and a sustained clinical and haemodynamic improvement was observed in only six patients. In primary pulmonary hypertension, the acute response rate to high doses of calcium-channel blockers is low (27%). Serious adverse reactions to high doses of calcium-channel blockers during acute testing are frequently observed in nonresponders. It is concluded that nitric oxide may be used as a screening agent for safely identifying patients with primary pulmonary hypertension who respond acutely to calcium-channel blockers and may benefit from long-term treatment with these agents.",4,E

The association between the use of calcium antagonists and cancer has been addressed recently in 6 independent epidemiological studies. Four of these studies--2 cohort and 2 case-control--found a significantly higher risk of cancer among users of certain calcium antagonists as compared with either non-users or with users of other antihypertensive agents. The other 2 studies failed to find support for this association. All studies had limitations of varying types and significance. The emerging pattern from these investigations includes the following features: (i) the strength of the association appears to be dependent on daily dosage, ranging from no association in users of low dosages to a 2-fold (or possibly higher) increased risk in users of higher dosages; (ii) the time lag to the appearance of this association appears to be at least 2 to 3 years; (iii) an association with a higher risk of cancer has been found primarily for verapamil, while no such relationship has been reported for diltiazem; and (iv) no highly consistent associations have been shown with specific cancer sites or histological types.

Patients were also closely monitored for clinical events, coronary artery patency and indices of infarct size and of left ventricular function.; Creatine kinase elevation, Q wave score, global and regional left ventricular function and coronary artery patency at 48 h were not significantly different between the diltiazem and placebo groups. A greater improvement observed in regional perfusion and function with diltiazem was likely explained by initial larger defects. Diltiazem, compared to placebo, reduced the rate of death, reinfarction or recurrent ischemia at 35 days from 41% to 13% (p=0.027) and prevented the need for an urgent intervention. The rate of death or myocardial infarction was reduced by 65% (p=0.15).

The mean change from baseline in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was -18.8/-13.6 mmHg with nisoldipine CC and -17.4/-11.3 mmHg with felodipine. The most common adverse events included peripheral oedema and headache; neither treatment affected heart rate. Thus, nisoldipine CC and felodipine provide comparable antihypertensive efficacy. The adverse effects of both drugs are related to their vasodilator properties and are common to the class.",5,E

Therefore, we performed such a study in patients with nondiabetic renal disease and proteinuria. After a 4-week wash-out period in which patients did not use any medication known to affect proteinuria, 21 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either the calcium channel blocker amlodipine (Amlo, 5 to 10 mg) or the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril (Lis, 5 to 10 mg). Throughout the 16-week study period, blood pressure, creatinine clearances, and proteinuria were measured every 2 weeks. In addition, device-measured blood pressure and renal hemodynamic studies were performed at the start and end of the study. Systolic blood pressure fell in the Lis group from 163+/-7 (SEM) to 140+/-8 mm Hg (P < .01) and from 157+/-10 to 147+/-6 mm Hg in the Amlo group; diastolic blood pressure fell from 101+/-3 to 86+/-7 mm Hg in the Lis group and from 98+/-3 to 91+/-2 mm Hg in the Amlo group. Renal hemodynamics were not affected by amlodipine treatment, whereas a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was seen in lisinopril-treated patients (from 55+/-11 to 50+/-10 mL/min; P < .01). Amlodipine did not significantly affect proteinuria. Lisinopril induced a decline in the protein-creatinine ratio with a maximal effect reached after 12 to 16 weeks of therapy (from 0.39+/-0.17 to 0.26 +/-0.11 g/mmol; P < .009). In conclusion, we could not demonstrate an antiproteinuric effect of the long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine, whereas therapy with the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril resulted in a decrease in proteinuria. Amlodipine did not affect renal hemodynamics, whereas lisinopril induced a fall in GFR.",5,E

The effects on blood pressure and on echocardiographic LV functional parameters were also analysed. After two months of randomized treatment with Nifedipine GITS or HCTZ, if diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mmHg, a combination of the two drugs was given and was continued for 24 weeks. M-mode, 2D-guided echocardiography was used to measure LV mass index (LVMI) according to the ""Penn convention"". Minimal vascular resistance was measured in the forearm, from arterial pressure and maximal blood flow, using a strain gauge plethysmography. All examinations were performed before and after 8 and 24 weeks of treatment. Changes in LVMI were analysed at 8 weeks and at 24 weeks in patients receiving monotherapy (""according to protocol"" analysis), and also at the end of treatment in patients taking Nifedipine or HCTZ monotherapy or the combination of the two drugs (""intention to treat"" analysis). Both Nifedipine and HCTZ significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), without any significant difference between the two drug treatments. Heart rate was not significantly modified by either treatment. A progressive decrease in LVMI was observed after 8 and 24 weeks of treatment with Nifedipine monotherapy (ANOVA, p = 0.03), while the decrease in LVMI during HCTZ treatment did not progress further at 24 weeks (ANOVA, p = 0.49). A significant reduction of minimal vascular resistance was observed in patients treated with Nifedipine GITS monotherapy (ANOVA, p = 0.001), but not in the HCTZ group (ANOVA, p = 0.06). Comparison of changes of forearm minimal vascular resistance, considering baseline values, could demonstrate a greater effect during Nifedipine monotherapy as compared to HCTZ monotherapy. In conclusion, in a group of hypertensive patients with LVH, treatment for 24 weeks with Nifedipine GITS alone or in combination with HCTZ induced a significant reduction in LVMI and of forearm vascular structural changes, as evaluated by minimal vascular resistance. The decrease of minimal vascular resistance was significantly greater in patients treated with Nifedipine monotherapy, as compared to those given HCTZ.",5,E

Although the number of treated hypertensive patients has increased, only 25% of treated patients have their blood pressure levels under control. The benefit of treating hypertension has been proven, but cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates remain high. The ideal antihypertensive drug should not only normalize blood pressure levels, but also reduce the associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. The role of angiotensin II in systemic hypertension and its complications has been recently redefined. The potent trophic effects of angiotensin II on blood vessels and on cardiac cells have been well demonstrated, especially the role of angiotensin II in left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, and congestive heart failure. Of all ongoing mortality and morbidity trials in systemic hypertension, VALUE (Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation) is the only one comparing an angiotensin II antagonist (valsartan) with a third-generation calcium channel blocker (amlodipine). The main hypothesis of the VALUE trial is that, for an equivalent decrease in blood pressure, valsartan will be more effective than amlodipine in decreasing cardiac mortality and morbidity. VALUE is a prospective, multinational, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, 2-arm parallel group comparison with a response-dependent dose titration scheme. VALUE involves 14,400 patients in over 30 countries, who will be followed for 4 years or until 1450 patients experience a primary endpoint. The population to be included in VALUE consists of hypertensive men and women, aged 50 years or older, and at a relatively high risk of sustaining a cardiovascular event. The high risk profile is defined taking into account age, gender, and a list of cardiovascular risk factors and disease factors. Risk factors are cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, uncomplicated left ventricular hypertrophy, proteinuria, and high serum creatinine. Disease factors include documented history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy with strain on the ECG. A unique feature of VALUE is the assessment of the predictive power of this cardiovascular risk factor scale in a large population of treated hypertensive patients. The trial started on 10 September 1997.",1,E

Patients were hospitalized and controls were not. They were randomly matched based on contemporaneous eligibility for Medicaid benefits. Odds ratios for hospitalization in patients exposed to known drug-drug interactions were compared with those in patients exposed to one of the interacting agents. When confidence intervals did not overlap, the odds ratio was considered to be significantly increased. Odds ratios were significantly increased for many interacting drug pairs, and were associated with commonly recognized interactions as well as less widely recognized ones. Cimetidine interactions achieved significance only with theophylline. In the Medicaid population, exposure to a number of drug-drug interactions was associated with a significantly increased risk of hospitalization.",6,E

The study was conducted with prescription sequence analysis of each resident's detailed pharmacy records and data on morbidity and mobility.; Use of drugs, which according to the summaries of product characteristics (SPC) and the literature on adverse drug effects have moderately to strongly constipating properties, was associated with a relative risk of 1.59 (95% CI 1.24-2.04) for the occurrence of constipation during exposure time. Use of drugs with mildly to moderately constipating effects was not associated with laxative use (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.93-1.38). Stratification on the level of age, gender, type of nursing (psychogeriatric or somatic), morbidity, number of medications taken and mobility showed no confounding effects of these variables on outcome measurements. These variables all acted as effect modifiers. Effect of age and number of medications taken on the relative risk was nonlinear.; Although an association between drugs that exhibit moderately to strongly constipating effects and occurrence of constipation was found, the risk was not as high as seen in previous studies. The high prevalence of constipation in nursing home patients is only partly due to adverse drug effects.",3,E

After successful intravenous tocolysis with magnesium sulfate, 69 women with preterm labor at <35 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to nifedipine (20 mg orally every 4-6 hr), or diltiazem (30-60 mg orally every 4-6 hr). The primary outcome was the percentage of patients achieving 37 weeks gestation. Maternal cardiovascular alterations and neonatal outcomes were also assessed. Sixty-nine patients were available for final analysis. Less patients on diltiazem as compared to nifedipine achieved 37 weeks (15.1% vs. 41.7%, P = 0.019). Gestational age at delivery was also less for patients receiving diltiazem (35.5 +/- 3.5 weeks vs. 33.4 +/- 3.9 weeks, P = 0.022). There were fewer days gained in utero from randomization to delivery with diltiazem as compared to nifedipine; however, this difference was not statistically significant (22.4 +/- 16.3 days vs. 31.2 +/- 24.4 days, P = 0.084). Maternal blood pressure and pulse during tocolysis did not differ significantly between groups. Despite the theoretical advantages of diltiazem tocolysis, maintenance tocolysis with diltiazem offered no benefit over nifedipine in achieving 37 weeks gestation. The cardiovascular alterations with either drug in normotensive, pregnant patients appear minimal.",4,E

Since calcium channel blockers are well-tolerated and efficacious in African Americans, we undertook this study to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 3 commonly prescribed calcium channel blockers: amlodipine besylate (Norvasc), nifedipine coat core (CC) (Adalat CC), and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) (Procardia XL).; One hundred ninety-two hypertensive patients across 10 study centers were randomly assigned to double-blind monotherapy with amlodipine besylate (5 mg/d), nifedipine CC (30 mg/d), or nifedipine GITS (30 mg/d) for 8 weeks. Patients not achieving therapeutic response after 4 weeks had their dose doubled for the next 4 weeks. The primary end point was a comparison of the average reduction (week 8 minus baseline) in 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Secondary end points included a comparison of average 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP), office SBP or DBP reduction, responder rates, safety, and tolerability.; One hundred sixty-three patients were evaluable for efficacy after 8 weeks. There was no significant difference in the average 24-hour ambulatory DBP (-8.5, -9.0, and -6.1 mm Hg, respectively) or SBP (-14.3, -15.7, and -11.8 mm Hg, respectively) reduction. Average office SBP and DBP were reduced to a comparable degree (19-22 mm Hg [P =.50] and 12-14 mm Hg [P =.51], respectively). Responder rates (DBP <90 or reduced by > or = 10 mm Hg) were similar (P = .38). Discontinuation rates and adverse event frequency were distributed similarly across the 3 treatment groups.; The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the 3 dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are equivalent in African Americans with stages 1 and 2 hypertension.",5,E

We assessed the effect of amlodipine on cause-specific mortality in such patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In total, 1,153 patients in New York Heart Association class IIIb or IV heart failure were randomized to receive amlodipine or placebo, along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. Over a median 14.5 months of follow-up, 413 patients died. Cardiovascular deaths accounted for 89% of fatalities, 50% of which were sudden deaths and 45% of which were due to pump failure, with fewer attributed to myocardial infarction (3.3%) or other cardiovascular causes (1.6%). Amlodipine treatment resulted in a greater relative reduction in sudden deaths (21%) than in pump failure deaths (6.6%) overall. When patients were classified by etiology of heart failure (ischemic or nonischemic), cause-specific mortality did not differ significantly between treatment groups in the ischemic stratum. In the nonischemic stratum, however, sudden deaths and pump failure deaths were reduced by 38% and 45%, respectively, with amlodipine. Thus, when added to digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with advanced heart failure, amlodipine appears to have no effect on cause-specific mortality in ischemic cardiomyopathy, but both pump failure and sudden deaths appear to be decreased in nonischemic heart failure patients treated with amlodipine.",I,I

For this reason, recent attention has focused on calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. While these agents reduce blood pressure, outcome data from large randomized trials are lacking, but some case-control data, dominated by short-acting dihydropyridines, suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular events. These studies had methodologic limitations and did not differentiate among calcium antagonist types and formulations. Several studies differentiating among calcium antagonist types and an overview of published randomized trials show no increased risk with verapamil and suggestion for benefit in CAD patients.; A total of 27,000 CAD patients with hypertension will be randomized at 1,500 primary care sites to receive either a calcium antagonist-based (verapamil) or beta-blocker/diuretic-based (atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide) antihypertensive care strategy. The study uses a novel, electronic ""paper-less"" system for direct on-screen data entry, randomization and drug distribution from a mail pharmacy linked to the coordination center via the Internet.; Contract negotiations with the United States and international sites are ongoing. Patients being enrolled are predominantly elderly (72% aged 60 years or older) men (54%), with either an abnormal coronary angiogram or prior MI (71%). In addition to hypertension, CAD and elderly age, most patients (89%) have one or more associated conditions (diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, cerebral or peripheral vascular disease, etc.) contributing to increased risk for adverse outcome. While 26% have diabetes, most of these are noninsulin dependent. Using the protocol strategies, target blood pressures (according to JNC VI) have been reached in 58% at the fourth visit, and as expected most (89%) are requiring multiple antihypertensive drugs.; The design and baseline characteristics of the initial patients recruited for a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter study comparing two therapeutic strategies to control hypertension in CAD patients are described.",I,I

After a placebo wash out period, 140 patients were randomly assigned to receive either losartan 50 mg or nifedipine GITS 30 mg. Patients were evaluated at 4-week intervals during a 12-week treatment period. Patients receiving losartan had HCTZ 12.5 mg added and increased to 25 mg to reduce DBP <90 mm Hg. Patients receiving nifedipine GITS had their dose increased to 60 mg and 90 mg to reduce DBP <90 mm Hg. Efficacy, tolerability and quality of life were assessed during the 12 weeks on each regimen. Patients treated with the losartan regimen (n = 73) had reductions in trough sitting DBP of -10, -13, and -13 mm Hg after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of therapy, respectively. Patients receiving the nifedipine GITS regimen (n = 67) had DBP reductions of -14, -15, and -15 mm Hg, respectively. There were no significant differences in the DBP response between the treatment groups except at week 4 (P < 0.05). Similar reductions in systolic BP (SBP) between the two treatment groups were observed at all time points. The percentages of patients in the two treatment groups reaching goal DBP (<90 mm Hg or DBP > or =90 mm Hg with a reduction from a baseline of > or =10 mm Hg) were comparable (81% on the losartan regimen and 90% on the nifedipine GITS regimen). There were significantly more adverse events reported in patients receiving nifedipine GITS when compared to the losartan regimen (54% vs 36%, P < 0.05). A patient-reported symptom inventory also showed that swollen ankles was bothersome in significantly more patients treated with the nifedipine GITS regimen when compared to the losartan regimen (24% vs 5%, P = 0.001). Thus, in elderly patients with diastolic hypertension, a regimen of losartan alone or with HCTZ has similar efficacy to a regimen of nifedipine GITS with greater tolerability and less symptom bother due to swollen ankles.",5,E

The trial comprised 163 patients who were treated first for four weeks by a monotherapy with 2 mg trandolapril. After these four weeks patients who attained normal blood pressure proceeded with trandolapril treatment. Hypertensive patients who did not attain normal diastolic pressure levels were treated for another four weeks by a fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR. After four weeks of treatment with trandolapril 62 patients of 163 (37%) had a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. The fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR reduced the diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg in 71.6% of the patients resistant to treatment with 2 mg trandolapril and in another 15.6% of patients it reduced the diastolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg or more. After two months of treatment 60 patients had a normal blood pressure due to trandolapril (37%) and another 73 patients (45%) treated by a combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR, i.e. a total of 133 patients (82%) who originally suffered from moderately severe hypertension, attained a normal diastolic blood pressure. The mean decrease of diastolic pressure after two months of treatment was 19.5 mm Hg in ""non-respondents"" to trandolapril monotherapy and 23.6 mm Hg in ""respondents"". The mean decrease of systolic pressure in ""non-respondents"" and ""respondents"" after trandolapril treatment was 19.5 mm Hg and 35.0 mm Hg resp. The fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil was not only effective but was associated with a minimum of undesirable effects. The incidence of headaches declined significantly. The combination of the above preparations is useful also because both preparations have a cardio- and nephroprotective effect and do not affect the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Treatment with a fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR is indicated in moderately severe hypertension not responding to monotherapy, in particular when associated with diabetes, hyperlipoproteinaemia, ischaemic heart disease or left ventricular hypertrophy.",1,E

Because chemical cardioversion is often ineffective, ventricular rate control remains a principal goal of therapy. The authors hypothesized that patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia after major noncardiac surgery who receive intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade for ventricular rate control would experience conversion to sinus rhythm at a rate that differs from those receiving intravenous calcium channel blockade.; The rate of conversion to sinus rhythm at 2 and 12 h after treatment was examined in 64 cases of postoperative supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. After adenosine administration, patients who remained in supraventricular tachyarrhythmia were prospectively randomized to receive either intravenous diltiazem or intravenous esmolol for ventricular rate control (unblinded). Loading and infusion rates were adjusted to achieve equivalent degrees of ventricular rate control.; Patients were similar with regard to age and Apache III score. Most patients in both groups had atrial fibrillation (esmolol, 79%; diltiazem, 81%), and none experienced stable conversion with adenosine. Patients randomized to receive esmolol experienced a 59% rate of conversion to sinus rhythm within 2 h of treatment, compared with only 33% for patients randomized to receive diltiazem (intention to treat, P = 0.049; odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.046 to 7.8). After 12 h of therapy, the number of patients converting to sinus rhythm increased in both groups (esmolol, 85%; diltiazem, 62%), and the rates of conversion no longer differed significantly. Ventricular rates when supraventricular tachyarrhythmia began and after 2 and 12 h of rate control therapy were similar in the two treatment groups. The in-hospital mortality rate and length of stay in the intensive care unit were not significantly influenced by treatment group.; Among adenosine-resistant patients in the intensive care unit with atrial fibrillation after noncardiac surgery, intravenous esmolol produced a more rapid (2-h) conversion to sinus rhythm than did intravenous diltiazem.",6,E

The present paper reports the principal results of the ultrasound substudy of the randomized, prospective, controlled, Verapamil in Hypertension and Atherosclerosis Study (VHAS).; In 498 hypertensive patients in eight Italian centres, randomized to either verapamil (240 mg once a day) or chlorthalidone (25 mg once a day), a B-mode ultrasound scan was performed according to a standardized procedure at baseline and after 3, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months of treatment. The maximum intima-media thicknesses of the far walls of common, bifurcation and internal carotid arteries were measured bilaterally, and the following indices calculated: the mean thickness at the six measured sites, the mean thickness at the common and bifurcation sites and the single maximum thickness. The primary endpoint for treatment efficacy was the slope of the change over 4 years (rate of change, mm/year), corrected by using the initial mean over the six sites (baseline + 3 months) as a covariate (mm/year per mm). The patients were also classified into three strata according to their baseline single maximum thickness: those with normal carotid arteries (single maximum ( 1 mm), those with thickened carotid arteries (single maximum > 1 and < or = 1.5 mm and those with carotid plaques (single maximum > 1.5 mm).; Among the 456 patients with satisfactory baseline ultrasound readings, 33% were classified with normal carotid arteries, 27% with thickened carotid arteries and 40% with plaques. In the intention-to-treat population (377 patients with ultrasound measurements taken on at least three different occasions over a period of at least 2 years), the rate of change in the mean thickness at the six sites measured was rather small (0.015 mm/year), but significantly (P < 0.05) smaller in patients with plaques (0.003 mm/year) than in patients with thickened or with normal carotids (0.023 and 0.025 mm/year, respectively). When related to initial values, the rate of change in the mean thickness at the six sites had a negative slope (-0.059 mm/year per mm, P < 0.01). Although rates of change in the carotid intima-media thickness in unstratified patients were not different in those treated with verapamil or with chlorthalidone, when changes in the mean thickness of six sites were related to the initial value, the slope of this relationship was significantly different in the two treatment groups (verapamil -0.082 versus chlorthalidone -0.037 mm/year per mm, P < 0.02). The blood pressure-lowering effect of the two randomized treatments was similar. Taking fatal and nonfatal, major and minor cardiovascular events together, there were 19 events in the verapamil group and 35 in the chlorthalidone group, with a significantly (P < 0.01) greater incidence in patients with plaques, and among patients with plaques in those who were randomized to chlorthalidone (P < 0.05).; In accord with evidence from animal models of atherosclerosis, the calcium antagonist verapamil was more effective than the diuretic chlorthalidone in promoting regression of thicker carotid lesions. Changes in the carotid intima-media thickness were small in both groups, and the differences between the changes under the two treatments were consequently small, but the observation that these small differences in carotid wall changes were paralleled by differences in the incidence of cardiovascular events (better intima-media thickness regression with verapamil paralleled by a lower cardiovascular event rate) suggests that even small effects on carotid plaques may have clinical and prognostic relevance.",I,E

This study examined the differences in quality of life produced by two once-daily calcium channel blockers using different delivery systems: nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) and amlodipine.; This was a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized clinical trial comparing nifedipine GITS (30 mg) and amlodipine (5 mg) for 24 weeks following a placebo run-in. Clinical, laboratory evaluations and quality-of-life data were assessed at screening, baseline randomization and three times during active therapy.; The study was conducted in 13 medical clinics in Spain.; The sample comprised 430 screened and 356 randomized patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mmHg).; Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in health-related quality of life were the main outcome measures.; There were no significant differences between active treatment groups in the blood pressure changes (systolic blood pressure: nifedipine GITS -15.5 mmHg; amlodipine -15.7 mmHg). Spontaneous adverse events consistent with calcium channel blockage were not different. The nifedipine GITS group improved in all quality-of-life measures except Sexual Symptom Distress and showed a significantly greater improvement than amlodipine in overall Quality of Life (P< 0.05), General Perceived Health (P < 0.026) and its subscale Vitality (P < 0.019). The amlodipine group declined in overall Quality of Life, General Perceived Health, Vitality and Sleep Disturbance, and significantly in Sexual Symptom Distress (P < 0.045). However, this group improved in self-reported Cognitive Functioning (P=0.036), Mental Acuity (P < 0.005) and Detachment/disorientation (P=0.01).; These results suggest compound-specific effects on quality of life that may be due to differences in the delivery system. Nifedipine GITS is short-acting (2 h half-life) and is delivered continuously over a 24 h period, while amlodipine has a half-life of 40 h, which may produce more sustained low-level effects. While a more beneficial profile was observed for nifedipine, amlodipine demonstrated potential positive effects on cognitive functioning.",I,I

The objective of this study was to determine whether prostate cancer is associated with calcium channel blocker use. A case-control study was conducted in Massachusetts using cases diagnosed from December 1992 through February 1995. Cases were men identified by tumor registrars who were less than 70 years old with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Controls were men with no history of prostate cancer or symptoms of undiagnosed prostate cancer, and were matched to the cases on precinct of residence and half-decade of age. A total of 1217 cases of prostate cancer and 1400 community controls are included in this analysis. Data were collected by telephone interview. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate relative risks for calcium channel blockers use while controlling for confounding. The relative risk for prostate cancer for any use of calcium channel blockers relative to nonuse was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-1.5). There was no evidence of a trend according to duration of use. When the analysis was confined to symptomatic men, the relative risk estimate was 1.1 (0.8-1.4) overall and 1.2 (0.8-1.7) among those aged 65 to 69 years. Relative risk estimates for the use of other classes of antihypertensive drugs among symptomatic men were close to 1.0; the corresponding estimates among asymptomatic men were generally further from 1.0. These findings suggest that calcium channel blockers do not increase the risk of prostate cancer. The differences in the relative risk estimates between symptomatic and asymptomatic men are compatible with detection bias. Because of the widespread use of Prostate-Specific Antigen testing for early detection of prostate cancer, potential detection bias needs to be considered in future studies of prostate cancer.",I,6

We recruited 2996 men and 3454 women, aged 55-80 years, with blood pressure during placebo run-in >150/95 mmHg or isolated systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg from nine countries. Treatment allocation to nifedipine GITS 30 mg daily or co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/amiloride 5 mg) once daily was performed by minimization rather than randomization to balance additional risk factors. This was followed by four optional increases in treatment: dose-doubling of the primary drug, addition of atenolol 25/50 mg or enalapril 5/10 mg, and then any other hypotensive drug excluding calcium blockers or diuretics. Target blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg or a fall > or = 20/10 mmHg.; Blood pressure at randomization was 172+/-15 / 99+/-9 mmHg. Thirteen per cent of the patients were previously untreated.

This was tested by analyzing data from patients who had taken part in the Circadian Anti-ischemia Program in Europe (CAPE) trial. After a 2-week, single-blind, run-in period (Phase 1), patients were randomized to amlodipine, 5 mg/day (first 4 weeks) and 10 mg/day (second 4 weeks), or placebo for 8 weeks (Phase 2). The 48-h Holter data were analyzed for 167 amlodipine-treated patients and 83 placebo patients based on a 2:1 randomization scheme. Sixty-three per cent of amlodipine patients and 67% of placebo patients were receiving concomitant BBLs, and >90% had taken sublingual nitrates during anginal attacks, as basic antiischemic therapy. After 7 weeks of therapy, when 48-h Holter monitoring was repeated, there were no significant changes in the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in the placebo or amlodipine groups for all patients or subgroups of patients with or without BBLs. Also, between-group comparisons showed no significant differences in arrhythmias between amlodipine and placebo patients. In summary, amlodipine (5-10 mg/day) given to patients with severe, chronic CAD receiving conventional antiischemic therapy, did not produce any proarrhythmic effects.",2,E

To investigate whether calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors increase vascular nitric oxide activity, we assessed systemic and renal vascular sensitivity to nitric oxide synthase inhibition in hypertensives on and off medication.; Ten essential hypertensive patients, aged 22-51 years, were studied 3 times: > or = 4 weeks off medication, after 3 weeks treatment with enalapril 20 mg twice a day and after 3 weeks nifedipine 60 mg/day. Each time, 24-h blood pressure registration was performed, followed by a clearance study to obtain a 3-h dose-response curve for intravenously infused NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, respectively 0.75, 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/h).; L-NMMA dose-dependently increased mean arterial pressure with 5 +/- 2 mmHg and systemic vascular resistance with 24 +/- 5% at maximum dose, whereas cardiac output decreased (all P < 0.001). Enalapril and nifedipine treatment decreased blood pressure, while the L-NMMA-induced increase in systemic vascular resistance was potentiated (enalapril: 45 +/- 7% and nifedipine: 46 +/- 8%; both P < 0.01). L-NMMA also dose-dependently decreased renal blood flow by 58 +/- 8% at maximum dose (P < 0.001), but neither drug potentiated these effects.; These results indicate that, in essential hypertensives, antihypertensive therapy with enalapril or nifedipine increases nitric oxide dependency of systemic vascular tone, which may play a role in the blood pressure lowering effect of these drugs. However, this phenomenon cannot be observed in the renal circulation, suggesting a different regulation of endothelium-dependent vasomotion in the hypertensive kidney.",5,E

A total of 535 patients over 65 years old with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 90-115 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure 160-220 mmHg, were recruited at 46 centres worldwide. Patients were randomised to felodipine ER 2.5 mg or amlodipine 5 mg. If blood pressure was > 160/90 mmHg after three or six weeks, felodipine ER was increased to 5 and 10 mg and amlodipine to 10 mg. After nine weeks, average doses of felodipine ER and amlodipine were 5.5 mg and 7.3 mg, respectively. Newly occurring vasodilatory adverse events were reported by 32% of felodipine ER patients and 43% of amlodipine patients (p = 0.007). Both treatments effectively reduced blood pressure 24 hours post-dose. Using a low starting dose and individual titration, felodipine ER achieves good control of blood pressure with few vasodilatory side-effects.",5,E

After 8 weeks+/-1 week taking Nif-CC, they were again monitored with a 24-hour blood pressure monitor. The 24-hour blood pressure load (percentage of values > 135/85 mm Hg for 24 hrs), daytime blood pressure load (percentage of values > 140/90 mm Hg from 7:00 A.M.-10:00 P.M.), nighttime blood pressure load (percentage of values > 120/80 mm Hg from 10:00 P.M.-7:00 A.M.), diurnal blood pressure variation, average 24-hour blood pressure, daytime blood pressure, nighttime blood pressure, mean blood pressure for the first 4 hours, and last 8 hours of the dosing interval were measured. Adverse effects such as headache, dizziness, and edema were also reported.; No differences in average 24 hour-blood pressure readings were observed but significant differences in blood pressure control during the first 4 and last 8 hours of the dosing interval were seen. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher after approximately 16 hours in patients switched from Nif-GITS to Nif-CC. Although Nif-CC caused a greater initial response, it was less effective than Nif-GITS after 16 hours. This could explain the lack of differences in average 24-hour blood pressure values between formulations. Of the 20 patients, 20% experienced increased headaches, 20% showed signs of increased peripheral edema, and 10% reported occasional dizziness after switching agents. Three patients discontinued Nif-CC, two as ordered by their primary care physician and one on his own due to headache.; This study suggests that patients switched from Nif-GITS to Nif-CC could experience increased blood pressure during the night or toward the end of the dosing interval. They could also experience adverse effects such as headache, edema, and dizziness, which could result in more physician visits and put patients with other disease states such as coronary heart disease at increased risk.",6,E

If blood pressure (BP) remained suboptimally controlled after 4 weeks (supine diastolic BP >90 mm Hg 24-h post dose), the dose was doubled for a further 4 weeks. After 8 weeks felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine BP significantly more than enalapril (19.7/12.0 mmHg and 11.1/7.2 mm Hg, respectively). The mean differences in change in BP between treatments were 8.6/4.8 mm Hg in favour of felodipine-metoprolol (P = 0.001/P <0.001). A statistically significant difference to the advantage of felodipine-metoprolol was also seen in standing BP. Even though the dose was increased in a larger proportion of patients in the enalapril group (61%) than in the felodipine-metoprolol group (40%), fewer enalapril-treated patients achieved adequate BP control (41% vs 63% on felodipine-metoprolol, P <0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. Three patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and four with enalapril discontinued treatment due to adverse events. A similar number of patients reported adverse events in each treatment group. In conclusion, a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 5/50-10/100 mg once daily reduced BP more effectively than enalapril 10-20 mg once daily 24 h post dose. The result was expected, but a more important observation was that both treatments were tolerated to a similar degree. Obviously, a considerable BP reduction may be well tolerated, as was the main purpose to demonstrate in this study.",2,6

Treatment was started with a response dependent 3-step dose titration period. All patients were initiated at dose step 1 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 120/0.5 mg o.d.) and if not normalised (DBP <90 mm Hg) titrated at 4-weekly intervals over dose step 2 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/1 mg o.d.) to dose step 3 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg o.d.) during the first 12 weeks. After 3 months of treatment all patients not normalised were excluded from further participation in the study. The total duration of the treatment period was 6 months. Routine safety investigations were performed prior, during and on completion of the treatment period. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was highly effective in reducing blood pressure. At individual last visit during active treatment (also taking the non-responders into account), the mean reduction in SBP/DBP was 21.9/17.1 mm Hg (95% CI 19.8-24.1/16.1-18.1 mm Hg), with most of this reduction occurring during the first 3 months of treatment. After 6 months, 81.9% of the patients enrolled showed normalisation of DBP (<90 mm Hg) and 85% were responders (normalisation and/or reduction in DBP by at least 10 mm Hg). Normalisation and responder rates appeared to be comparable when stratified by age subgroups (63-69, 70-79 and > or =80 years) and were all greater than 80%. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was very well tolerated and there was no evidence of any clinically relevant changes in routine laboratory safety variables or resting ECG. In conclusion, the fixed dose combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril is an effective and safe alternative treatment for the elderly hypertensive patient.",3,E

Two hundred patients with a diastolic blood pressure (BP) in the range 95 to 109 mm Hg were randomised to active treatment for 6 weeks. For the per-protocol efficacy population, both treatments resulted in clinically significant mean reductions of trough diastolic BP (nifedipine GITS -8.9 mm Hg, bendrofluazide -7.9 mm Hg) and systolic BP (nifedipine GITS -10.4 mm Hg, bendrofluazide -10.5 mm Hg). The study demonstrated that nifedipine GITS was 'at least equivalent' to bendrofluazide in the reduction of trough diastolic BP (one-sided upper 95% confidence limit, 0.5 mm Hg), where inequivalence had been pre-defined as a difference in mean diastolic BP of > or =5 mm Hg. Both drugs were well tolerated, the overall incidence of adverse events in the nifedipine GITS treatment group being 34.0% (34/100) and in the bendrofluazide treatment group being 29.0% (29/100). The commonest events (incidence > or =5%) were headache, constipation, 'flu syndrome and vasodilatation with nifedipine GITS and headache and nausea with bendrofluazide. An increased incidence of elevations of plasma urea and glucose was observed in patients treated with bendrofluazide (9.6% and 30.4% respectively) compared to those treated with nifedipine GITS (3.1% and 18.8% respectively). Nifedipine GITS 20 mg once daily is 'at least equivalent' to bendrofluazide 2.5 mg once daily in reduction of blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.",5,E

A MEDLARS search of published articles from 1966 to 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish, supplemented by a manual search of bibliographies, identified 60 randomized controlled trials that met protocol criteria. Blinded articles were extracted by 2 physicians. The pooled risks of death, withdrawal, and cardiovascular event were computed and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) for all nifedipine formulations and relative to same study control drug regimens. Thirty cardiovascular events were reported in 2635 nifedipine exposures (1.14%) and 19 events in 2655 other active drug exposures (0.72%). Unadjusted ORs for nifedipine versus controls were 1.40 (95% CI, 0.56 to 3.49) for major events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedure), 1.75 (95% CI, 0.83 to 3.67) for increased angina, and 1.61 (95% CI, 0.91 to 2.87) for all events (major events plus increased angina). Episodes of increased angina were more frequent on immediate-release nifedipine (OR, 4.19 [95% CI, 1.41 to 12.49]) and on nifedipine monotherapy (OR, 2.61 [95% CI, 1.30 to 5.26]). The OR for immediate-release nifedipine was significantly higher than that for sustained-release/extended-release nifedipine (P=0.001), and the OR for nifedipine monotherapy was higher than that for nifedipine combination therapy (P=0.03). Increased risks of cardiovascular events in patients with stable angina on nifedipine were due primarily to more episodes of increased angina, confined to the immediate-release formulation and to nifedipine monotherapy.",I,I

The VR data were analyzed by ANOVA with repeated measures. The circadian phase differences were evaluated by cosinor analysis.; The 24-h mean (+/-SD) values of VR (bpm) were - digoxin: 78.9 +/- 16.3, diltiazem: 80.0+/-15.5, atenolol: 75.9+/-11.7, digoxin + diltiazem: 67.3+/-14.1 and digoxin + atenolol: 65.0+/-9.4. Circadian patterns were significant in each treatment group (p < 0.001). The VR on digoxin + atenolol was significantly lower than that on digoxin (p < 0.0001), diltiazem (p < 0.0002) and atenolol (p < 0.001). The time of peak VR on Holter was significantly delayed with regimens 3 and 5 which included atenolol (p < 0.03). During exercise, digoxin and digoxin + atenolol treatments resulted in the highest and lowest mean VR respectively. The exercise Time-VR plots of all groups were nearly parallel (p = ns). The exercise duration was similar in all treatment groups (p = ns).; This study indicates that digoxin and diltiazem, as single agents at the doses tested, are least effective for controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation during daily activity. Digoxin + atenolol produced the most effective rate control reflecting a synergistic effect on the AV node. The data provides a basis for testing the effects of chronic suppression of diurnal fluctuations of VR on left atrial and ventricular function in CAF.",I,I
