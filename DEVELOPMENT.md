# DEVELOPMENT

## Build project

Build the project from source with the following code.

	python setup.py compile_assets
	python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

## Development workflow

### Git Submodules
Some demo datasets are included as a submodule. Directory [asreview/tests/citation-file-formatting](https://github.com/ottomattas/asreview/tree/development-v1/tests) is cloned from [citation-file-formatting](https://github.com/asreview/citation-file-formatting).

Examples:
- To clone the full repository with submodules in one line, add `--recursive` flag:

	```git clone --recursive git://github.com/asreview/asreview.git```

- To update the submodule, you would still need to follow the contribution guide in the submodule repository. And then create a PR for the main repository with the updated submodule commit.


### Back end
Install Python

Install the ASReview package

	pip install -e .

Start the Python API server with the Flask development environment

	export FLASK_ENV=development
	asreview lab

For Windows, use

	set FLASK_ENV=development
	asreview lab

### Front end

Install both [npm][1] and Python

Start the Python API server with the Flask development environment. Before the front end development can be started, the back end has to run as well

	export FLASK_ENV=development
	asreview lab

For Windows, use

	set FLASK_ENV=development
	asreview lab

Navigate to `asreview/webapp` and install the front end application with npm

	cd asreview/webapp
	npm install

The user interface is written in [React][2]. Start the local front end application with npm

	npm start

Open the web browser at `localhost:3000`

**Important**: Ignore `localhost:5000`. You can also find a front end on `:5000` but this is not relevant for the current front end development step.

Please make use of Prettier (https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) to
format React/Javascript code. Use the following code to format all files in
the webapp folder.

```
cd asreview/webapp
npx prettier --write .
```
